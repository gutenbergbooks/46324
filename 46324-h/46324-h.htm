<h2>RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />

<small>LAST ARTICLE.</small></h2>


<p>In our third article on the AbbÃ©
Martin's exhaustive work on the future
of Protestantism and Catholicity,
we disposed of the pretension of Protestants
that the Reformation created
and has sustained civil and political
liberty in modern society. We proceed
in the present and concluding
article to dispose, as far as we can,
of the pretension that it has founded
and sustained religious liberty, or the
freedom of conscience.</p>

<p>No fact is more certain than that
the Reformation has the credit with
non-Catholics, if not even with some
half-instructed Catholics themselves,
of having originated religious liberty
and vindicated the freedom of the
mind. Here as elsewhere the formula
of the age, or what claims to be
enlightened in it, is, Protestantism and
freedom, or Catholicity and slavery;
and it is to its <i>prestige</i> of having founded
and sustained religious liberty that
Protestantism owes its chief ability in
our times to carry on its war against
the church. Protestantism, like all
false religions or systems, having no
foundation in truth and no vital energy
of its own, lives and prospers only
by availing itself of the so-called spirit
of the age, or by appealing to the
dominant public opinion of the time
and the place. In the sixteenth century,
the age tended to the revival
of imperialism or cÃ¦sarism, and Protestantism
favored monarchical absolutism,
and drew from it its life, its
force, and its sustenance.</p>

<p>The spirit or dominant tendency
of our age, dating from the middle
of the last century, has been and is
the revival of the pagan republic, or,
as we call it, democratic cÃ¦sarism,
which asserts for the people as the
state the supremacy which under imperialism
is asserted for the emperor.
Protestantism lives and sustains itself
now only by appealing to and representing
this tendency, as we may see
in the contemporary objections to the
church, that she is "behind the age,"
"does not conform to the age," "is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>hostile to the spirit of the age," "opposed
to the spirit of the nineteenth
century."</p>

<p>Every age, nation, or community understands
by liberty, freedom to follow
unrestrained its own dominant tendency;
we might say, its own dominant
passion. In the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, liberty meant
the freedom of temporal sovereigns to
govern according to their own good
pleasure, unrestrained by the church,
on the one hand, and estates, diets, or
parliaments, on the other. Liberty
means now the freedom of the people,
unrestrained either by the rights of
God or the rights of princes, to govern
as they or the demagogues, their masters,
judge proper. Hence, liberty,
as the world understands it, varies in
its meaning from age to age, and from
nation to nation, and, indeed, from
individual to individual. Whatever
favors or is in accordance with the
dominant tendency or passion of an
age, nation, community, or individual,
favors or is in accordance with liberty;
and whatever opposes or impedes
it is opposed to liberty&mdash;is civil, political,
or spiritual despotism. Protestantism
never resists, but always follows,
and encourages and echoes the
dominant tendency of the age or nation.
The church, having a life and
force derived from a source independent
of the age or nation, seeks not
support in that dominant passion or
tendency, does not yield or conform
to it, but labors unceasingly and with
all her energy to conform it to herself.
Hence, in the estimation of the
world, Protestantism is always on the
side of liberty, and the church on the
side of despotism and slavery.</p>

<p>The attempt to deny this, and to
prove that the church favors liberty
in this sense, is perfectly idle; and to
seek to modify her position and action,
so as to force her to accept and
conform to the dominant or popular
tendency or passion of the age or
nation, is to mistake her essential
character and office, and to forget
that her precise mission is to govern
all men and nations, kings and peoples,
sovereigns and subjects, and to
conform them to the invariable and inflexible
law of God, which she is appointed
by God himself to declare and
apply, and therefore to resist with all
her might every passion or tendency
of every age, nation, community, or
individual, whenever and wherever it
deviates from that law of which she
is the guardian and judge. The
church is instituted, as every Catholic
who understands his religion believes,
to guard and defend the rights of God
on earth against any and every enemy,
at all times and in all places.
She therefore does not and cannot
accept, or in any degree favor, liberty
in the Protestant sense of liberty, and
if liberty in that sense be the true
sense, the Protestant pretension cannot
be successfully denied.</p>

<p>But we have already seen that liberty
in the Protestant sense is no liberty
at all, or a liberty that in the
civil and political order is identified
with cÃ¦sarism&mdash;the absolutism of the
prince in a monarchy, the absolutism
of the people or of the ruling majority
for the time in a democracy. This
last might be inferred from the ostracism
practised in democratic Athens,
and is asserted and defended, or rather
taken for granted, by almost the
entire secular press in democratic
America. The most conservative
politicians among us recognize the
justice of no restrictions on the will
of the people but such as are imposed
by written constitutions, and which a
majority or three fourths of the voters
may alter at will and as they will. It
is the boast of our popular orators
and writers that there are with us no
restrictions on the absolute will of the
people but such as the people voluntarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
impose on themselves, which, as
self-imposed, are simply no restrictions
at all. It is evident, then, if liberty
means any thing, if there is any difference
between liberty and despotism,
freedom and slavery, the Protestant
understanding of liberty is not the
true one.</p>

<p>Nor is the Protestant understanding
of <i>religious</i> liberty a whit more
true. We have found that the basis
or principle of all civil and political
liberty is religious liberty, or the freedom
and independence of religion&mdash;that
is to say, the spiritual order; but
from the point of view of Protestantism
there is no religion, no spiritual
order, to be free and independent.
According to Protestantism, religion
is a function, not a substantive existence
or an objective reality. It is, as
we have seen, on Protestant principles,
a function of the state, of the
community, or of the individual, and
whatever liberty there may be in the
case, must be predicated of one or
another of these, not of religion, or
the spiritual order. With Protestants
the freedom and independence of religion
or the spiritual order would be
an absurdity, for it is precisely that
which they began by protesting
against. It is of the very essence of
Protestantism to deny and make unrelenting
war on the freedom and
independence of religion, and the
only liberty in the case it can assert
is the freedom of the state, the community,
or the individual from religion
as law, and the right of one or
another of them to adopt or reject
any religion or none at all as they
choose, which is irreligious or infidel,
not religious liberty.</p>

<p>Protestantism, under its most favorable
aspect, is not, even in the
estimation of Protestants themselves,
religion, or a religion; but the view
of religion which the reformers took,
or which men take or may take of
religion. At best it is not the objective
truth or reality, but a human
doctrine or theory of it, which has no
existence out of the mind that forms
or entertains it. Hence, Protestants
assert, as their cardinal doctrine, justification
by faith alone; and which
faith is not the truth, but the mind's
view of it. Hence, too, they deny
that the sacraments are efficacious <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
opere operato</i>, and maintain that, if efficacious
at all, they are so <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex opere
suscipientis</i>. They reject the Real Presence
as a "fond imagination," and
make every thing in religion depend
on the subjective faith, conviction, or
persuasion of the recipient. The
church they recognize or assert is no
living organism, no kingdom of God
on earth, founded to teach and govern
all men and nations in all things
pertaining to eternal life or the spiritual
end of man, but a simple association
of individuals, with no life or
authority except what it derives from
the individuals associated, and which
is not hers, but theirs.</p>

<p>Some Protestants go so far as to
doubt or deny that there is any truth
or reality independent of the mind,
and hold that man is himself his own
teacher and his own law-giver; but all
concede, nay, maintain, that what is
known or is present to the mind is
never the reality, the truth, or the divine
law itself, but the mind's own
representation of it. Hence their
Protestantism is not something fixed
and invariable, the same in all times
and places, but varies as the mind of
Protestants itself varies, or as their
views, convictions, or feelings change,
and they change ever with the spirit
of the age or country. One of their
gravest objections to the church was,
in the sixteenth century, that she had
altered the faith; and in the nineteenth
century is, that she does not alter it,
that she remains inflexibly the same,
and absolutely refuses to change her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
faith to suit the times. They hold
their own faith and doctrine alterable
at will, and are continually changing
it. Evidently, then, they do not
hold it to be the truth; for truth never
changes: nor to be the law of God,
which they are bound to obey; for if
the law of God is alterable at all, it
can be so only by God himself, never
by man, any body of men, or any
creature of God. There is no Protestant
ignorant or conceited enough
to maintain the contrary.</p>

<p>This fact that Protestantism is a
theory, a doctrine, or a view of religion,
not the objective reality itself,
not the recognition and assertion of
the rights of God, but a human view
or theory of them, proves sufficiently
that it is incompatible with the assertion
of <i>religious</i> liberty. All it can
do is to assert the right or liberty of
the state to adopt and ordain any
view of religion it may take; of the
community to form and enforce its
own views, convictions, or opinions;
or of the individual to make a religion
to suit himself, or to go without any
religion at all, as he pleases. In
none of these cases is there any religious
liberty; and in them all religion
is subjected to a purely human authority&mdash;the
authority of the state, of
the community, or of the individual,
one as human as another. Protestantism
is really in its very nature and
essence an earnest and solemn protest
against religious liberty, and for it to
assert the freedom and independence
of religion, or the spiritual order&mdash;that
is, of religion as law to which all men
are bound to conform&mdash;would be to
commit suicide. Even the supremacy
of the spiritual order, which our
old Puritans asserted, was only the
assertion of the authority of their interpretation
of the written word against
the divine authority to interpret it
claimed by the church, and against
the human authority of the civil magistrate
claimed by Anglicanism, from
which they separated, while it subjected
it to the congregation, the brotherhood,
or to the ministers and elders,
no more spiritual than the civil magistrate
himself.</p>

<p>In the beginning Protestantism
made religion in nearly all Protestant
nations a function of the state, as it is
still in Great Britain, Prussia, the several
Protestant German states, in
Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Holland,
and the Protestant cantons of Switzerland.
The progress of events, and
the changes of opinion, have produced
a revolt among Protestant nations
against this order, and Protestants
now make, or are struggling to make,
it a function of the community or
the sect, and the more advanced party
of them demand that it be made
a function of the individual. This
advanced party do not demand the
freedom of religion, but the freedom
of the individual from all religious
restraints, from all obligations of obedience
to any religious law, and indeed
of any law at all, except the
law he imposes on himself. Dr. Bellows,
of this city, a champion of this
party, proves that it is not the freedom
of religion, nor the freedom of the
individual to be of any religion he
chooses; for he denies that he is free
to be a Catholic, though he is free to
be any thing else. He tells Catholics
they are only tolerated; and threatens
them with extermination by the sword,
if they dare claim equal rights with
Protestants, and insist on having their
proportion of the public schools under
their own control, or on not being
taxed to support schools to which
they cannot with a good conscience
send their children.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, the pretension that
the Reformation has founded or favored
religious liberty is as worthless
as we have seen is the pretension that
it has founded or favored civil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
political liberty. It has, on the contrary,
uniformly opposed it, and asserted
only the liberty of its contradiction.
To assert the liberty of the
state, the people, or the individual to
control religion, or to assert the liberty
of infidelity or no-religion, surely
is not to assert the liberty of religion.
Protestantism yields always to the
spirit of the age, and asserts the right
of that spirit to modify, alter, or
subject religion to itself. There can
be no religious liberty where religion
must follow the spirit of the times,
and change as it changes. Religion,
if any thing, is the supreme law of
conscience, and conscience is a mere
name if obliged to obey as its supreme
law the dominant passion or
tendency of the age or nation. The
freedom of conscience is not in the
emancipation of conscience from all
law, for that were its destruction; but
in its being subjected to no law but
the law of God, promulgated by divine
authority, and declared to the
understanding by God himself, or a
court appointed, enlightened, and assisted
by the Holy Spirit. Under Protestantism
there is and can be no
freedom of conscience; for under it
conscience is either destroyed by being
subjected to no law, or enslaved
by being subjected to another law than
the law of God.</p>

<p>This conclusion, which we obtain
by a simple analysis of Protestantism,
is confirmed by all the facts in the
case. Every student of the history
of Protestantism knows that the reformers
never made the pretension
now put forth in their name. No man
was ever farther from proposing the
emancipation of the mind from what
is called spiritual thraldom than Martin
Luther, and no man ever showed
less respect for human reason. His
aim was to emancipate the church
from the authority of the pope; and
in this laudable work he engaged the
princes of the empire, who were
ready to assist him, because in doing
so they could also emancipate themselves,
make themselves pontiffs as
well as princes, and enrich themselves
with the spoils of the church. But
Luther substituted for the authority
of the pope and councils that of the
written word, as amended and interpreted
by himself. He never recognized
the so-called right of private
judgement, and never asserted the
right of every man to interpret the
written word for himself. The Bible
as interpreted by himself, Martin Luther,
was to be taken in all cases
as the supreme and only authority,
and he would tolerate no dissent from
his interpretation. He assumed for
himself more than papal authority;
for he confessedly assumed authority
to alter the written word, which assuredly
no pope ever did. He never
admitted any right of dissent from
his dicta, and wherever he could, he
suppressed it by the strong arm of
power.</p>

<p>John Calvin was not more tolerant,
as the burning of Michael Servetus
over a slow fire made of green wood,
and his pamphlet justifying the burning
of heretics, amply prove. Henry
VIII. of England put to death Catholics
and Lollards, beheaded Cardinal
Fisher and Sir Thomas More,
because they refused to take the oath
of the royal supremacy, except with
the qualification, "as far as the law
of Christ permits." In Sweden, the
peasants were entrapped into the support
of the Reformation by the infamous
Gustavus Vasa, under pretence
of recovering and reÃ«stablishing the
national independence; and after the
prince had regained by their aid his
throne and been crowned king, were
massacred by thousands because they
wished still to adhere to the Catholic
Church, and resisted its abolition. In
Geneva, Protestantism gained a footing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in much the same way. Protestants
came from Berne and other
places to assist the citizens in a political
rebellion against their prince,
who was also their bishop, and afterward
drove out the Catholics who
could not be forced to accept the Reformation.</p>

<p>We need not pursue the history of
the establishment of Protestantism,
which is written in blood. Suffice
it to say, that in no country
was the Reformation introduced
but by the aid of the civil power,
and in no state in which it gained
the mastery did it fail to be established
as the religion of the state,
and to obtain the suppression by force
or civil pains and penalties of the
old religion, and of all forms even of
Protestant dissent. The state religion
was bound hand and foot, and could
move only by permission of the temporal
sovereign, and no other religion
was tolerated. We all know the penal
laws against Catholics in England,
Ireland, and Scotland, reÃ«nacted with
additional severity under William and
Mary, almost in the eighteenth century.
James II., it is equally well
known, lost the crown of his three
kingdoms by an edict of toleration,
which, as it tolerated Catholics, was
denounced as an act of outrageous
tyranny. The penal laws against
Catholics were adopted by the Episcopalian
colony of Virginia, and the
Puritan colony of Massachusetts made
it an offence punishable with banishment
from the colony for a citizen to
harbor a Catholic priest for a single
night, or to give him a single meal of
victuals. It was only in 1788 that
the Presbyterian Assembly of the
United States expunged from their
confession of faith the article which
declares it the duty of the civil magistrate
to extirpate heretics and idolaters&mdash;an
article still retained by their
brethren in Scotland, and by the
United Presbyterians in this country.</p>

<p>Indeed, toleration is quite a recent
discovery. Old John Cotton, the first
minister of Boston, took care to warn
his hearers or readers that he did not
defend "that <i>devil's</i> doctrine, toleration."
Toleration to a limited extent
first began to be practised among
Protestants on the acquisition of provinces
whose religion was different
from that of the state making the
acquisition. The example was followed
of the pagan Romans, who tolerated
the national religion of every
conquered, tributary, or allied nation,
though they tolerated no religion
which was not national, and for three
hundred years martyred Christians because
their religion was not national,
but Catholic. It is only since Voltaire
and the EncyclopÃ¦dists preached
toleration as the most effective
weapon in their arsenal, as they supposed,
against Christianity, or the beginnings
of the French Revolution
of 1789, that Protestants have taken
up the strain, professed toleration,
and claimed to be, and, in
the face and eyes of all history, always
to have been, the champions
of religious liberty and the freedom
of conscience. It was not till 1829
that the very imperfect Catholic Relief
Bill passed in the British parliament,
and the complete disestablishment
of Congregationalism as the state
religion in Massachusetts did not take
place till 1835, though dissenters had
for some time previous been tolerated.</p>

<p>Yet in no Protestant state has complete
liberty been extended to Catholics.
The French Revolution,
with its high-flown phrases of liberty,
equality, brotherhood, and religious
freedom, suppressed the Catholic religion,
and imprisoned, deported, or
massacred the bishops and priests
who would not abandon it for the
civil church it ordained. We ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
though very young at the
time, remember the exultation of our
Protestant neighbors when the first
Napoleon dragged the venerable and
saintly Pius VII. from his throne and
held him a prisoner, first at Savona,
and afterward at Fontainebleau.
"Babylon is fallen," they cried; "the
man-child has slain the beast with seven
heads and ten horns." The revolutions,
ostensibly social and political,
which have been going on in the
Catholic nations of Europe, and are
still in process, and which everywhere
are hostile to the church, have the
warm sympathy of Protestants of
every nation, and in Italy and Spain
have been aided and abetted by Protestant
associations and contributions,
as part and parcel of the Protestant
programme for the abolition of the
papacy and the destruction of our
holy religion.</p>

<p>Protestants now tolerate Protestant
dissenters, and allow Jews and infidels
equal rights with themselves; but
they find great difficulty in regarding
any outrage on the freedom of the
church as an outrage on religious
liberty. She is Catholic, not national,
over all nations, and subject to
none; therefore no nation should tolerate
her. Even in this country Protestants
very reluctantly suffer her
presence, and the liberal Dr. Bellows,
a Protestant of Protestants, warns, as
we have seen, Catholics not to attempt
to act as if they stood on an
equality with Protestants. It is only
a few years since the whole country
was agitated by the Know-Nothing
movement, got up in secret lodges,
for the purpose, if not of outlawing
or banishing Catholics, at least of
depriving them of civil and political
citizenship. The movement professed
to be a movement in part against
naturalizing persons of foreign birth,
but really for the exclusion of such
persons only in so far as they were
Catholics. The controversy now raging
on the school question proves
that Protestants are very far from
feeling that Catholics have equal
rights with themselves, or that the
Catholic conscience is entitled to any
respect or consideration from the state.
Public opinion proscribes us, and no
Catholic could be chosen to represent
a purely Protestant constituency in
any legislative body, if known to be
such and to be devoted to his religion.
Our only protection, under God, is the
fact that we have votes which the
leaders of all parties want; yet there
is a movement now going on for female
suffrage, which, if successful, will,
it is hoped, swamp our votes by bringing
to the polls swarms of fanatical
women, the creatures of fanatical
preachers, together with other swarms
of infidel, lewd, or shameless women,
who detest Catholic marriage and
wish to be relieved of its restraints,
as well as of their duties as mothers.
This may turn the scale against us;
for Catholic women have too much
delicacy, and too much of that retiring
modesty that becomes the sex, to
be seen at the polls.</p>

<p>But the imperfect toleration practised
by Protestants is by no means
due to their Protestantism, but to their
growing indifference to religion, and
to the conviction of Protestant and
non-Catholic governments, that their
supremacy over the spiritual order is
so well established, their victory so
complete, that all danger of its renewing
the struggle to bring them
again under its law is past. Let
come what may, the spiritual order
can never regain its former supremacy,
or CÃ¦sar tremble again at the bar
of Peter. CÃ¦sar fancies that he has
shorn the church so completely of
her Catholicity, except as an empty
name, and so fully subjected her to
his own or the national authority,
that he has no longer any need to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
intolerant. Why not, indeed, amnesty
the poor Catholics, who can no
longer be dangerous to the national
sovereign, or interfere with the policy
of the state?</p>

<p>For ourselves, we do not pretend
that the church is or ever has been
tolerant. She is undeniably intolerant
in her own order, as the law, as
truth is intolerant, though she does
not necessarily require the state to be
intolerant. She certainly is opposed
to what the nineteenth century calls
religious liberty, which, we have seen,
is simply the liberty of infidelity or
irreligion. She does not teach views
or opinions, but presents the independent
truth, the reality itself; proclaims,
declares, and applies the law
of God, always and everywhere one
and the same. She cannot, then,
while faithful to her trust, allow the
truth to be denied without censuring
those who knowingly deny it, or the
law to be disobeyed without condemning
those who disobey it. But
always and everywhere does the
church assert, and, as far as she can,
maintain the full and perfect liberty
of religion, the entire freedom and independence
of the spiritual order, to
be itself and to act according to its
own laws&mdash;that is, religious liberty in
her sense, and, if the words mean any
thing, religious liberty in its only true
and legitimate sense.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century may not
be able to understand it, or, if understanding
it, to accept it; yet it is true
that the spiritual is the superior, and
the law of the temporal. The supremacy
belongs in all things of right
to God, represented on earth by the
church or the spiritual order. The
temporal has no rights, no legitimacy
save as subordinated to the spiritual&mdash;that
is, to the end for which man
is created and exists. The end for
which all creatures are made and exist
is not temporal, but spiritual and
eternal; for it is God himself who is
the final cause as well as the first
cause of creation. The end, or God
as final cause, prescribes the law
which all men must obey, or fail of
attaining their end, which is their supreme
good. This law all men and
nations, kings and peoples, sovereigns
and subjects, are alike bound to obey;
it is for all men, for states and empires,
no less than for individuals, the
supreme law, the law and the only
law that binds the conscience.</p>

<p>Now, religion is this law, and includes
all that it commands to be
done, all that it forbids to be done,
and all the means and conditions
of its fulfilment. The church, as all
Catholics hold, is the embodiment of
this law, and is therefore in her very
nature and constitution teleological.
She speaks always and everywhere
with the authority of God, as the final
cause of creation, and therefore her
words are law, her commands are the
commands of God. Christ, who is
God as well as man, is her personality,
and therefore she lives, teaches,
and governs in him, and he in her.
This being so, it is clear that religious
liberty must consist in the unrestrained
freedom and independence of the
church to teach and govern all men
and nations, princes and people, rulers
and ruled, in all things enjoined
by the teleological law of man's existence,
and therefore in the recognition
and maintenance for the church of
that very supreme authority which
the popes have always claimed, and
against which the Reformation protested,
and which secular princes are
generally disposed to resist when it
crosses their pride, their policy, their
ambition, or their love of power. Manifestly,
then, religious liberty and
Protestantism are mutually antagonistic,
each warring against the other.</p>

<p>The church asserts and vindicates
the rights of God in the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of men, and hence is she called the
kingdom of God on earth. The rights
of God are the foundation of all human
rights; for man cannot create or
originate rights, since he is a creature,
not his own, and belongs, all he is
and all he has, to his Creator. God's
rights being perfect and absolute, extend
to all his creatures; and he has
therefore the right that no one of his
creatures oppress or wrong another,
and that justice be done alike by all
men to all men. We can wrong no
man, deprive no man of life, liberty,
or the pursuit of happiness, without
violating the rights of God and offending
our Maker. "Inasmuch as
ye did it to the least of my brethren, ye
did it unto me." Hence, the church
in asserting and vindicating the rights
of God, asserts and protects in the
fullest manner possible the so-called
inalienable rights of man, opposes with
divine authority all tyranny, all despotism,
all arbitrary power, all wrong,
all oppression, every species of slavery,
and asserts the fullest liberty, political,
civil, social, and individual, that
is possible without confounding liberty
with license. The liberty she sustains
is true liberty; for it is that of
which our Lord speaks when he says,
"If the Son makes you free, ye shall
be free indeed." The church keeps,
guards, declares, and applies the divine
law, of which human laws must
be transcripts in order to have the
force or vigor of laws. Man has in
his own right no power to legislate
for man, and the state can rightfully
govern only by virtue of authority
from God. Hence, St. Paul says,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non est potestas nisi a Deo</i>. "There is
no power except from God."</p>

<p>The church in asserting the supremacy
of the law of God or of the spiritual
order, asserts not only religious
liberty, but all true liberty, civil, political,
social, and individual; and we
have seen that liberty, the basis and
condition of civilization, was steadily
advancing in all these respects during
the middle ages till interrupted by the
revival of paganism in the fifteenth
century and the outbreak of Protestantism
in the sixteenth. The Reformation
did not emancipate society
from spiritual thraldom, but raised it
up in revolt against legitimate authority,
and deprived it of all protection,
on the one hand, against arbitrary
power, and, on the other, against anarchy
and unbounded lawlessness,
as the experience of more than three
centuries has proved. There is not
a government in Europe that is not
daily conspired against, and it requires
five millions of armed soldiers even
in time of peace to maintain internal
order, and give some little security
to property and life. To pretend
that the authority of the church, as
the organ of the spiritual order, is
despotic, is to use words without understanding
their meaning. Her authority
is only that of the law of God,
and she uses it only to maintain the
rights of God, the basis and condition
of the rights of individuals and of society.
Man's rights, whether social
or individual, civil or political, are
the rights of God in and over man,
and they can be maintained only by
maintaining the rights of God, or,
what is the same thing, the authority
of the church of God in the government
of human affairs. Atheism is
the denial of liberty, as also is pantheism,
which denies God as creator.</p>

<p>There is no liberty where there is
no authority competent to assert and
maintain it, or where there is no authority
derived from God, who only
hath dominion. The men who seek
to get rid of authority as the condition
of asserting liberty are bereft of
reason, and more in need of physic
and good regimen than of argument.
Liberty is not in being exempt from
obedience, but in being held to obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
only the rightful or legitimate authority.
God's right to govern his creatures
is full and perfect, and any authority
he delegates or authorizes to
be exercised in his name, is legitimate,
and in no sense abridges or interferes
with liberty&mdash;unless by liberty you
mean license&mdash;but is the sole condition
of its maintenance. God's dominion
over man is absolute, but is
not despotic or tyrannical, since it is
only his absolute right. The authority
of the church, however extended
it may be, and she is the judge of
its extent and its limitations, as the
court is the judge of its own jurisdiction,
is not despotic, tyrannical, or oppressive,
because it is the authority
of God exercised through her.</p>

<p>The pretension of Protestants that
Protestantism favors liberty, and the
church despotism, is based on the
supposition that authority negatives
liberty and liberty negatives authority,
that whatever is given to the one
is taken from the other; a supposition
refuted some time since, in the
magazine for October last, in an article
entitled <cite>An Imaginary Contradiction</cite>,
and need detain us no longer at
present. Just or legitimate authority,
founded on the rights of God, and
instituted to assert and maintain them
in human affairs, confirms and protects
liberty instead of impairing it.</p>

<p>Yet there is no doubt that the
church condemns liberty in the sense
of the Reformation, and especially in
that of the nineteenth century. Protestantism
denies infallibility to the
church and assumes it for the age, for
the state, for public opinion&mdash;that is,
for the world. The most shocking
blasphemy in its eyes is to assert that
the age is fallible and cannot be relied
on as a safe or sure guide. We differ
from the Protestant; we attribute infallibility
to the church, and deny it to
the age, even though the age be this
enlightened nineteenth century. We
do not believe it is always wise or
prudent to suffer one's self to be carried
away by the dominant tendency or
passion of this or any other age. It
is characteristic of every age to fix
upon one special object or class of
objects, and to pursue them with an
exclusiveness and a concentrated passion
and energy that render them
practically evil, even though good
when taken in their place and wisely
pursued. Even maternal affection
becomes evil and destructive, if not
guided or restrained by wisdom and
prudence. Philanthropy is a noble
sentiment; yet men and women in
our own age, carried away, dazzled,
and blinded by it, only produce evils
they would avoid, defeat the very
good they would effect. The spirit
of our age is that of the production,
accumulation, and possession of material
goods. Material goods in their
proper measure and place are needed;
but when their production and
accumulation become with an individual
or an age an engrossing passion
that excludes the spiritual and
the eternal, they are evil, and lead
only to ruin, both spiritual and material,
as daily experience proves.</p>

<p>The church, then, instituted to teach
the truth and to secure obedience to
the law of God, directed always by
her divine ideal, is forced to resist always
and everywhere the age, that
is, the world, instead of following
its spirit, and to labor for its correction,
not for its encouragement.
Hence always is there more or less
opposition between the church and
what is called the spirit of the age,
and their mutual concordance is never
to be looked for so long as the world
stands. Hence the church in this
world is the church militant, and her
normal life one of never-ending struggle
with the world&mdash;spirit of the age,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der Welt-Geist</i>&mdash;the flesh, and the
devil. It is only by this struggle that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
she makes conquests for heaven,
and prevents civil governments from
degenerating into intolerable tyrannies,
and society from lapsing into pagan
darkness and superstition.</p>

<p>We have, we think, sufficiently disposed
of the Protestant pretension,
and if any of our readers think we
have not fully done it, we refer them
to the work before us. There is no
doubt that the boldness, not to say
impudence, with which the Protestant
pretension is urged, and the support
it receives from the rationalistic journalism
and literature which form contemporary
public opinion in Catholic
nations, coupled with the general ignorance
of history and the shortness of
men's memories, accounts for the chief
success of Protestant missions in unmaking
Catholics, which, though very
limited, is yet much greater than it
is pleasant to think. Yet gradually the
truth will find its way to the public;
even Protestants themselves will by
and by tell it, piece by piece, as
they are now doing. They have already
refuted many of the falsehoods
and calumnies they began by inventing
and publishing against the church,
and in due time they will refute the
rest.</p>

<p>The abbÃ© shows very clearly that
the toleration now accepted and to
some extent practised, and the liberty
now allowed to the various sects, will
most likely have a disastrous effect
on the future of Protestantism. It
must sooner or later, he thinks, lead
to the demolition of the Protestant
national establishments. National
churches cannot coexist with unlimited
freedom of dissent. The English
Church must soon follow the fate of
the Anglican Church in Ireland. Its
disestablishment is only a question
of time. So it will be before long in
all Protestant nations that have a national
church. The doctrine of toleration
and freedom for all sects and
opinions not only tends to produce
indifference to dogmatic theology, but
is itself a result of that indifference;
and indifference to dogmatic truth is
a more formidable enemy to deal with
than out-and-out disbelief or positive
infidelity. A soul breathing forth threatenings,
and filled with rage against
Christians, can be converted, and became
Paul the apostle and doctor of
the Gentiles; but the conversion of a
Gallio, who cares for none of these
things, is a rare event.</p>

<p>With the several sects, doctrinal differences
are daily becoming matters
of less and less importance. Who hears
now of controversies between Calvinists
and Arminians? Even the New
School and the Old School Presbyterians,
though separated by grave dogmatic
differences, unite and form one
and the same ecclesiastical body;
Presbyterians and Methodists work
together in harmony; Orthodox Congregationalists
show signs of fraternizing
with Unitarians, and Unitarians
fraternize with Radicals who reject
the very name of Christian, and can
hardly be said to believe even in
God. One need not any longer believe
any thing, except that Catholicity
is a gross superstition, and the
church a spiritual despotism, the grand
enemy of the human race, in order
to be a good and acceptable Protestant.
A certain inward sentiment,
emotion, or affection, which even a
pantheist or an atheist may experience,
suffices. The dread presence
of the church, hatred of Catholicity,
the zeal inspired by party attachment,
and the hope of finally arriving at
some solid footing, may keep up appearances
for some time to come; the
eloquence, the polished manners, the
personal influence, and the demagogic
arts and address of the preacher
may continue for a while to fill a few
fashionable meeting-houses; but when
success depends on the personal character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and address of the minister, as
is rapidly becoming the fact in all
Protestant sects, we may take it for
granted that Protestantism has seen
its best days, is going the way of all
the earth, and soon the place that
has known it shall know it no more
for ever.</p>

<p>Protestantism, with all deference
to our author, who pronounces it imperishable,
we venture to say, has
well-nigh run its course. It began
by divorcing the church from the papacy
and subjecting religion to the
national authority, subordinating the
spiritual to the temporal, the priest to
the magistrate, the representative of
heaven to the representative of earth.
It constituted the national sovereign
the supreme head and governor, the
pontifex maximus, after the manner
of the Gentiles, of the national religion,
or the national church, and punished
dissent as treason against the
prince. It was at first, and for over
two centuries, bitterly intolerant, especially
against Catholics, whom it
persecuted with a refined cruelty
which recalled, if it did not surpass,
that practised by paganism on Christians
in the martyr ages.</p>

<p>Tired of persecution, or finding it
impotent to prevent dissent, Protestantism
tried after a while its hand at
civil toleration. The state tolerated,
to a greater or less extent, at first
only Protestant dissenters from the
established church; but at last, though
with many restrictions, and with the
sword ever suspended over their heads,
even Catholics themselves. From
civil toleration, from ceasing to cut
the throats and confiscate the goods
of Catholics, and of Protestant recusants,
it is passing now to theological
tolerance, or what it calls complete
religious liberty, though as yet
only its advanced-guard have reached
it.</p>

<p>The state, unless in the American
republic, does not, indeed, disclaim its
supremacy over the church; but it
leaves religion to take care of itself,
as a thing beneath the notice of the
civil magistrate, so long as it abstains
from interfering with state policy,
or meddling with politics. To-day
Protestantism divorces, or is seeking
to divorce, the church from the
state, as it began by divorcing both
her and the state from the papacy; it
divorces religion from the church
and from morality, Christianity from
Christ, faith from dogma, piety from
reason, and it resolves into an affection
of man's emotional or sentimental
nature. We find persons
calling themselves Christians who
do not believe in Christ, or regard
him as a myth, and godly, who do
not even believe in God. We
have men, and women too, who demand
the disruption of the marriage
tie in the name of morality, and
free love in the name of purity.
Words lose their meaning. The churl
is called liberal, things bitter are called
sweet, and things profane are called
holy. Not many years since, there
was published in England, and republished
here, an earnest and ingenious
poem, designed to rehabilitate Satan,
and chanting his merits as man's noblest,
best, and truest friend. In the
mean time, every thing regarded as religion
loses its hold on the new generations;
moral corruption of all sorts in
public, domestic, and private life is
making fearful progress throughout the
Anglo-Saxon world, the mainstay of
Protestantism; and society seems tottering
on the verge of dissolution.
Such is the career Protestantism has
run, is running, or, by the merciless
logic to which it is subjected, will be
forced to run. What hope, then, can
Protestants have for its future?</p>

<p>As to the future of Catholicity,
we are under no apprehensions. We
know that never can the church be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in this world the church triumphant,
and that she and the world will always
be in a state of mutual hostility;
but the hostility can never harm
her, though it may cause the spiritual
ruin of the individuals and nations
that war against her. The Protestant
world have for over three hundred
years been trying to get on
without her, and have succeeded but
indifferently. Sensible and earnest-minded
men among Protestants themselves
boldly pronounce that the experiment
has failed, which most Protestants
inwardly feel, and sadly deplore;
but like the poor man in Balzac's
novel, who has spent his own
patrimony, his wife's dower, the portion
of his daughter, with all he could
borrow, beg, or steal, and reduced
his wife, his children, and himself to
utter destitution, in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recherche
d'absolu</i>, they are buoyed up by the
feeling that they are just a-going to
succeed. But even this feeling cannot
last always. Hope too long
"deferred maketh the heart sick." It
may be long yet, and many souls for
whom Christ has died be lost, before
the nations that have apostatized
learn wisdom enough to abandon the
delusive hope, and turn again to Him
whom they have rejected, or look
again, weeping, on the face of Him
whom they have crucified. But the
church will stand, whether they return
or not; for she is founded on a
rock that cannot be shaken, on the
eternal truth of God, that cannot fail.</p>

<p>The Protestant experiment has demonstrated
beyond question that the
very things in the Catholic Church
which are most offensive to this age,
and for which it wages unrelenting
war against her, are precisely those
things it most needs for its own protection
and safety. It needs, first of
all, the Catholic Church&mdash;nay, the
papacy itself&mdash;to declare and apply
the law of God to states and empires,
to sovereigns and subjects, kings and
peoples, that politics may no longer
be divorced from religion, but be rendered
subsidiary to the spiritual, the
eternal end of man, for which both
individuals and society exist and civil
governments are instituted. It needs
the church to declare and enforce the
law, by such means as she judges proper,
that should govern the relation
of the sexes; to hallow and protect
marriage, the basis of the family, as
the family is of society, that great sacrament
or mysterious union, typical
of the union of Christ with the church,
which is indissoluble; to take charge
of education, and to train up, or cause
to be trained up, the young in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord,
or in the way they should go, that
when old they shall not depart from
it; to teach maidens modesty and
reserve, and wives and mothers due
submission to their husbands and
proper care of their children; to assert
and protect the rights of women;
to train them to be contented to be
women, and not to aspire to be men,
or to usurp the functions of men, and
to bid them stay at home, and not
be gadding abroad, running over the
country and spouting nonsense, free
love, infidelity, impiety, and blasphemy,
at suffrage conventions and other
gatherings, at which it is a shame
for a woman to open her mouth, or
even to be present; and, most of all,
to exercise a vigilant censorship over
ideas, whether vented in books, journals,
or lectures, and to keep from
the public those which tend to mislead
the mind or corrupt the heart,
as a prudent father strives to keep
them from his children.</p>

<p>The age needs for this the <em>Catholic</em>
Church. A national church cannot
do it; far less can the sects do it.
These all depend on the public opinion
of the age, the nation, or the sect,
and have no power to withstand that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
opinion. This is perhaps better understood
here than elsewhere. The
sects, being creatures of opinion, have
no power to control it, and their tendency
is invariably to seize upon
every opinion, excitement, or movement
that is, or is likely to be, popular,
and help it on as the means of
swelling, when it is at flood-tide, their
own respective numbers. A national
church has undoubtedly more stability,
and is not so easily wrested from
its moorings. But it has only the
stability of the government that ordains
it, and the most absolute government
must sooner or later yield
to the force of opinion. Opinion has
disestablished and disendowed the
state church in Ireland, and will, as
is most likely, do it ere long in both
England and Scotland. The Protestant
sects have no alternative; they
must either yield to the dominant opinion,
tendency, or passion of the times
and move on with it, or be swept away
by it.</p>

<p>It is only a church truly catholic,
that depends on no nation, that extends
to all, and is over all, that derives
not its being or its strength from
the opinion of courts or of peoples,
but rests on God for her being, her
law, and her support, that can maintain
her integrity, or have the courage
to stand before an age or a nation,
denounce its errors, and condemn
its dominant passion or tendency, or
that would be heeded, if she did. It
was only the visible head of the Catholic
Church, the vicar of Christ, that
could perform the heroic act of publishing
in this century the Syllabus;
and if, as we are confident they have,
the prelates assembled in the Council
of the Vatican have some share of the
courage of their chief, their decrees will
not only draw the attention of the
world anew to the church, but go far
to prove to apostate nations and truculent
governments that she takes
counsel of God, not of the weakness
and timidity of men.</p>

<p>A few more such acts as the publication
of the Syllabus and the convocation
of the council now sitting at
Rome, joined to the manifest failure
of Protestantism, will serve to open
the eyes of the people, disabuse non-Catholics
of the delusions under which
they are led away to their own destruction.
The very freedom, though
false in principle, which is suffered in
Protestant nations, while it removes
all restraints from infidelity, immorality,
and blasphemy, aids the victory
of the church over her enemies.
It ruins them by suffering them to
run into all manner of excesses; but
she can use it without danger and
with advantage where there are minds
to be convinced or hearts to be won;
for she can abide the freest examination,
the most rigid investigation and
scrutiny, while the indwelling Holy
Ghost cannot fail to protect her from
all error on either side. The present
delusions of the loud-boasting nineteenth
century must give way before
her as she once more stands forth in
her true light, and her present enemies
be vanquished.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>The historical romance of Mr. Keon, now
republished with the author's most cordial
permission and his latest corrections, was
first printed in London, in 1866, by Mr.
Bentley, publisher in ordinary to the Queen.
The edition was brought out in a very handsome
style, and sold at the high price of a
guinea. Notwithstanding the heavy price
at which the work was furnished to our
transpontine kinsfolk, (or at least to the "upper
ten thousand" of them,) it is at this
moment out of print, and an effort made
about two years ago to procure copies for
sale in this country was unsuccessful. The
copy kindly sent us by the author was accidentally
mislaid for several months, and this
circumstance, together with the desire to
give our readers the opportunity of perusing
the work as soon as their attention should
be directed to it by a notice such as its high
merit demands, caused us to delay the proper
public acknowledgment to the author
until the present moment. Its success in
England, in spite of the nationality and religion
of the writer, is no slight proof of its
intrinsic excellence, especially when we consider
that he ventured into a field which the
subject-matter of the book would turn into
the very home and headquarters of English
prejudice.</p>

<p>To every effect adequate cause; and, in
this instance, to those who take up the story
of <i>Dion</i>, one cause of its success will, before
they have gone half way through its
events and adventures, speak for itself. Yet,
however light to read, the work has, we
feel convinced, been in the last degree laborious
both to plan and to execute. "Easy
writing," said Thomas Moore, "very often
makes fearfully hard reading." We believe
the converse has often proved equally true.</p>

<p>We are glad to learn that Mr. Keon has
recently received a far more gratifying recognition
of his distinguished merit than
any other to which a Catholic author can aspire.
At a private audience granted him
by Pius IX., His Holiness complimented
him on his services to literature and religion,
and gave him a beautiful rosary of
pearl as a token of his august favor.</p>

<p>One word more, and we shall let the story
itself begin to be heard. The epoch of
<i>Dion</i> was the turning-point of all human
history&mdash;the hinge of the fateful gates, the
moment of the mightiest and most stupendous
transition our world has ever known,
the transition of transitions; the moment
on this earth of a superplanetary, supercosmic
drama. There were two suns in
the heavens; one rising, never to set; the
other going down to rise no more. At no
epoch had human genius blazed so luminous,
or human pride poised itself on wings
so wide, in a sphere so sublime; but this
genius was for the first time confronted in
its own sphere by divine inspiration and a
supernatural authority. The setting of a
classic though pagan day saw the dawning
day of Christianity. There were two suns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in one sky at the same moment. The doubtful
cross-lights of two civilizations over-arched
the world with a vault of shifting, contending,
contrary, and awful splendors&mdash;those
of one order in the utmost intensity
of their radiance, those of the other in their
first, glimmering beginnings; a seeming
confusion; an internecine war; a hazy mingling
of embattled glories as full of meaning
as it was of mystery.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>It was a fair evening in autumn,
toward the end of the year eleven
of our Lord. Augustus CÃ¦sar was a
white-haired, olive-complexioned, and
somewhat frail-featured, though stately
man of more than seventy-three.
At the beginning of the century in
which this was written, the face of
the first Napoleon recalled to the
minds of antiquaries and students of
numismatic remains the lineaments,
engraved upon the extant coins of
Augustus. Indeed, at this moment
there is in the Vatican a beautiful
marble bust in excellent preservation,
representing one of these two emperors
as he was while yet young; and
this bust almost invariably produces
a curious effect upon the stranger
who contemplates it for the first time.
"That is certainly a beautiful artistic
work," he says, "but the likeness is
hardly perfect."</p>

<p>"Likeness of whom?" replies some
Italian friend. "Of the emperor,"
says the stranger. "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sicuro!</i> But
which emperor?" asks the Italian,
smiling. "Of course, the first," says
the visitor; "<em>not this</em> one." "But
that represents Augustus CÃ¦sar, not
Napoleon Bonaparte," is the answer.
Whereupon the stranger, who, a moment
before had very justly pronounced
the resemblance to Bonaparte to
be hardly perfect, exclaims, not less
justly, What an amazing likeness to
Napoleon! That sort of admiring
surprise is intelligible. Had the bust
been designed as an image of the
great modern conqueror, there had
been something to censure. But the
work which, at one and the same
time, delineates the second CÃ¦sar,
and yet now after 1800 years recalls
to mind the first Napoleon, has become
a curious monument indeed.</p>

<p>The second Roman emperor, however,
had not a forehead so broad
and commanding nor so marble
smooth as Napoleon's, and the whole
countenance, at the time when our
narrative begins, offered a more decisively
aquiline curve, with more numerous
and much thinner lines about
the mouth. Still, even at the age which
he had then reached&mdash;in the year
eleven of our Lord&mdash;he showed traces
of that amazing beauty which had
enchanted the whole classic world in
the days of his youth. Three years
more, and his reign and life were to
go down in a great, broad, calm,
treacherous sunset together.</p>

<p>After the senate had rewarded the
histrionic and purely make-believe
moderation of its master&mdash;and in
truth its destroyer&mdash;by giving to one
who had named himself <i>Princeps</i> the
greater name of Augustus, the former
title, like a left-off robe, too good to
be thrown away, was carefully picked
up, brushed into all its gloss, and appropriated
by a second performer.
We allude, of course, to Drusus Tiberius
Claudius Nero, the future emperor,
best known by his second
name of Tiberius. The first and
third names had belonged to his brother
also. Tiberius was then "Prince
and CÃ¦sar," as the new slang of flattery
termed him; he was stepson of
Augustus and already adopted heir,
solemnly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">designatus</i>. He was verging
upon the close of his fifty-third year
of cautious profligacy, clandestine
vindictiveness, and strictly-regulated
vices. History has not accused him
of murdering Agrippa Vespasianus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
but had Agrippa survived, he would
have held all Tiberius's present offices.
Ãlius Sejanus, commander
of the prÃ¦torian guards, was occupied
in watching the monthly, watching
even the daily, decay of strength
in the living emperor, and was pandering
to the passions of his probable
successor. Up to this time Sejanus
had been, and still was, thus employed.
More dangerous hopes had not
arisen in his bosom; he had not yet
indulged in the vision of becoming
master of the known world&mdash;a dream
which, some twenty years afterward,
consigned him to cruel and sudden
destruction. No conspirator, perhaps,
ever exercised more craft and
patience in preparing, or betrayed
more stupidity at last in executing,
an attempt at treason on so great a
scale. It was forty-six years since
Sallust had expired amid the luxuries
which cruelty and rapine accumulated,
after profligacy had first brought
him acquainted with want.</p>

<p>Ovid had just been sent into exile
at Temesvar in Turkey&mdash;then called
Tomos in Scythia. Cornelius Nepos
was ending his days in the personal
privacy and literary notoriety in which
he had lived. Virgil had been dead
a whole generation; so had Tibullus;
Catullus, half a century; Propertius,
some twenty years; Horace and MÃ¦cenas,
about as long. The grateful
master of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiosa felicitas verborum</i>
had followed in three weeks to&mdash;not
the grave, indeed, but&mdash;the urn,
the patron whom he had immortalized
in the first of his odes, the first of his
epodes, the first of his satires, and
the first of his epistles; and the
mighty sovereign upon whose youthful
court those three characters&mdash;a
wise, mild, clement, yet firm minister,
a glorious epic poet, and an unsurpassed
lyrist&mdash;have reflected so much
and such enduring lustre, had faithfully
and unceasingly lamented their
irreparable loss. Lucius Varius was
the fashionable poet, the laureate of
the day; and MÃ¦cenas being removed,
Tiberius sought to govern indirectly,
as minister, all those matters
which he did not control directly and
immediately, as one of the two CÃ¦sars
whom Augustus had appointed.
Velleius Paterculus, the cavalry colonel,
or military tribune, (chiliarch,) a
prosperous and accomplished patrician,
was beginning to shine at once
in letters and at the court. The
grandson of Livia, grandson also of
Augustus by his marriage with her,
but really grand-nephew of that emperor&mdash;we
mean the son of Antonia,
the celebrated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Germanicus</i>, second
and more worthy bearer of that surname&mdash;a
youth full of fire and genius,
and tingling with noble blood&mdash;was
preparing to atone for the disgraces
and to repair the disasters which
Quintilius Varus, one year before,
amidst the uncleared forests of Germany,
had brought upon the imperial
arms and the Roman name. Germanicus,
indeed, was about to fulfil
the more important part of a celebrated
classic injunction; he was going
to do things worthy to be written,
"while the supple courtier of all CÃ¦sars,
Paterculus, was endeavoring to
<i>write something worthy to be read</i>."
Strabo had not long before commenced
his system of geography, which,
for about thirty years yet to come,
was to engage his attention and dictate
his travels. Livy, of the "pictured
page," who doubtless may be
called, next to Tacitus, the most eloquent
without being set down as
quite the most credulous of classic
historians&mdash;I venture to say so, <i>pace
Niebuhr</i>&mdash;was over sixty-eight years
of age, but scarcely looked sixty.
He was even then thoroughly and
universally appreciated. No man
living had received more genuine
marks of honor&mdash;not even the emperor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
His hundred and forty-two
books of Roman history had filled
the known world with his praises, a
glory which length of days allowed
him fully to enjoy. Modern readers
appreciate and admire the thirty-five
books which alone are left, and linger
over the beauties, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi stellis</i>, with
which they shine. Yet who knows
but these may be among the poorest
productions of Livy's genius? A
very simple sum in arithmetic would
satisfy an actuary that we must have
lost the most valuable emanations of
the Paduan's great mind. Given a
salvage of five-and-thirty out of a hundred
and forty-two, and yet the whole
of this wreck so marvellous in beauty!
surely that which is gone for ever
must have included much that is
equal, probably something far superior
to what time has spared.</p>

<p>There is a curious fact recorded by
Pliny the younger, which speaks for
itself. A Spaniard of Cadiz had, only
some five months before the date of
our story, journeyed from the ends of
the earth to Rome merely to obtain
a sight of Livy. There were imperial
shows in the forum and hippodrome
and circus at the time; there were
races on foot, and on horseback, and
in chariots; fights there were of all
kinds&mdash;men against wild animals, men
against each other; with the sword,
with the deadly cestus; wrestling
matches, and the dreadful battles of
gladiators, five hundred a side; in
short, all the glitter and the glories
and the horrors of the old classic
arena in its culminating days. There
was also a strange new Greek fence,
since inherited by Naples, and preserved
all through the middle ages
down to this hour, with the straight,
pliant, three-edged rapier, to witness
which even ladies thronged with interest
and partisanship. But the Spaniard
from Gades (Cervantes might
surely have had such an ancestor)
asked only to be shown Titus Livius.
Which in yonder group is Livy? The
wayfarer cared for nothing else that
Roman civilization or Roman vanity
could show him. The great writer
was pointed out, and then the traveller,
having satisfied the motive which
had brought him to Rome, went back
to Ostia, where his lugger, if I may so
call it, lay, (I picture it a kind of
"wing-and-wing" rigged vessel;) and,
refusing to profane his eyes with any
meaner spectacle, set sail again for
Spain, where his youth had been illumined
with the visions presented to a
sympathetic imagination by the most
charming of classical historians. The
Spaniards from an immemorial age
are deemed to have been heroes and
appreciators of heroes; and no doubt
this literary pilgrim, once more at
home, recurred many a time, long
pondering, to the glorious deeds of
the <i>Fabia Gens</i>.</p>

<p>How many other similar examples
Livy may have recorded for him we
moderns cannot say. Before his gaze
arose the finished column from the
fragments whereof we have gathered
up some scattered bricks and marbles.
Niebuhr had to deal with a
ruin, and he who ought to have
guessed at and reconstructed the
plan of it, has contented himself with
trying to demolish its form.</p>

<p>Long previously to the date of our
tale, Augustus, trembling under the
despotism of his wife Livia, had begun
to repeat those lamentations (with
which scholars are familiar) for the
times when MÃ¦cenas had guided his
active day, and Virgil and Horace
had beguiled his lettered evenings.
Virgil, as is well known, had been
tormented with asthma, and ought
possibly to have lived much longer
but for some unrecorded imprudence.
Horace, as is likewise well known,
had been tormented with sore eyelids&mdash;and
with wine; he was "blear-eyed,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lippus</i>.) Augustus, therefore,
used to say wittily, as he placed them
on each hand of him at the <i>symposium</i>,
which had been recently borrowed in
Italy from the Greeks, but had not
yet degenerated into the debauchery
and extravagance into which they
afterward sank more and more deeply
during successive reigns, "I sit
between sighs and tears." <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In suspiriis
sedeo et in lachrymis.</i> But he
had long lost these so-called sighs
and tears at either hand of him. The
sighs and tears were now his own.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>Our chronicle commences in Campania,
with the Tyrrhenian Sea (now
the southerly waters of the Gulf of
Genoa) on a traveller's left hand if he
looks north. It was a fair evening in
autumn, as we have remarked, during
that age and state of the world the
broad outlines of which we have
briefly given. Along the Appian, or,
as it long afterward came to be also
called, the Trajan Way, the queen of
roads, a conveyance drawn by two
horses, a carriage of the common
hackney description, not unlike one
species of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vettura</i> used by the modern
Italians, was rolling swiftly northward
between the stage of MinturnÃ¦
and the next stage, which was a lonely
post-house a few miles south of the
interesting town of FormiÃ¦&mdash;not <i>Forum
Appii</i>, or the <i>Three Taverns</i>, a
place more than fifty miles away in
the direction of Rome, and upon the
same road.</p>

<p>Inside the carriage were a lady in
middle life, whose face, once lovely,
was still sweet and charming, and a
very pale, beautiful female child, each
dressed in a black <i>ricinium</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or
mourning robe, drawn over the top
of the head. The girl was about
twelve years old, or a little more, and
seemed to be suffering much and
grievously. She faced the horses, and
on her side sat the lady fanning her
and watching her with a look which
always spoke love, and now and again
anguish. Opposite to them, with his
back to the horses, wearing a sort of
dark <i>lacerna</i>, or thin, light great-coat,
of costly material, but of a fashion
which was deemed in Italy at that
day either foreign or vulgar, as the
case might be, sat a youth of about
eighteen. The child was leaning
back with her eyes closed. The youth,
as he watched her, sighed now and
then. At last he put both hands
to his face, and, leaning his head forward,
suffered tears to flow silently
through his fingers. The <i>lacerna</i>
which he wore was fastened at the
breast by two <i>fibulÃ¦</i>, or clasps of silver,
and girt round his waist with a
broad, brown, sheeny leather belt,
stamped and traced after some Asiatic
mode. In a loop of this belt, at his
left side, was secured within its black
scabbard an unfamiliar, outlandish-looking,
long, straight, three-edged
sword, which he had pulled round so
as to rest the point before his feet,
bringing the blade between his knees,
and the hilt, which was gay with
emeralds, in front of his chest.</p>

<p>The Romans still very generally
went bare-headed,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> even out of doors,
except that those who continued to
wear the toga drew it over their heads
as the weather needed, and those
who wore the <i>penula</i> used the hood
of it in the same way. But upon
the hilt of the sword we have described
the youth had flung a sort of
<i>petasus</i>, or deep-rimmed hat, with a
flat top, and one black feather at the
side, not stuck perpendicularly into
the band, but so trained half round
it as to produce a reckless, rakish effect,
of which the owner was unconscious.</p>

<p>"Agatha," said the lady, in a low,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>tender voice, the delicate Greek ring
of which was full of persuasion,
"look up, beloved child! Your brother
and I, at least, are left. Think
no more of the past. The gods have
taken your father, after men had taken
his and your inheritance. But
our part in life is not yet over. Did
not your parents too, in times past&mdash;did
not we too, I say, lose ours? Did
you not know you were probably to
live longer than your poor father?
Are you not to survive me also? Perhaps
soon."</p>

<p>With a cry of dismay the young
girl threw her arms round the lady's
neck and sobbed. The other, while
she shed tears, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I thank that unknown power,
of whom Dionysius the Athenian,
my young countryman, so sublimely
speaks, that the child weeps at last!
Weep, Agatha, weep; but mourn not
mute in the cowardice of despair!
Mourn not for your father in a way
unbecoming of his child and mine.
Mourn not as though indeed you
were not ours. My husband is gone
for ever, but he went in honor. The
courageless grief, that canker without
voice or tears, which would slay his
child, will not bring back to me the
partner of my days, nor to you your
father. We must not dishearten but
cheer your brother Paulus for the battle
which is before him."</p>

<p>"I wish to do so, my mother,"
said Agatha.</p>

<p>"When I recover my rights," broke
in the youth at this point, "my father
will come and sit among the <i>lares</i>,
round the ever-burning fire in the
<i>atrium</i> of our hereditary house, Agatha;
and therefore courage! You
are ill; but Charicles, the great physician
of Tiberius CÃ¦sar, is our countryman,
and he will attend you. He
can cure almost any thing, they say.
And if you feel fatigued, no wonder,
so help me! <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minime mirum mehercle!</i>
Have we not travelled without
intermission, by land and by sea, all
the way from Thrace? But now,
one more change of horses brings us
to FormiÃ¦, and then we shall be at
our journey's end. Meantime, dear
child, look up; see yonder woods,
and the garden-like shore."</p>

<p>And having first tried in vain to
brighten the horn window at the side
of the vehicle, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">specular corneum</i>, (glass
was used only in the private carriages
of the rich,) he stood up, and calling
over the hide roof of the carriage,
which was open in front&mdash;the horses
being driven from behind&mdash;he ordered
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rhedarius</i>, or coachman, to
open the panels. The man, evidently
a former slave of the family, now
their freedman, quickly obeyed, and
descending from his bench, pushed
back into grooves contrived to receive
them the coarsely-figured and
gaudily colored sides of the travelling
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carruca</i>.</p>

<p>"Is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parvula</i> better?" he then cried,
with the privileged freedom of an
old and attached domestic, or of one
who, in the far more endearing parlance
of classic times, was a faithful
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familiaris</i>&mdash;that is, a member of the
family. "Is the little one better?
The dust is laid now, little one; the
evening comes; the light slants; the
sun smiles not higher than yourself,
instead of burning overhead. See,
the beautiful country! See, the sweet
land! Let the breeze bring a bloom
to your cheeks, as it brings the perfumes
to your mouth. Ah! the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parvula</i>
smiles. Fate is not always angry!"</p>

<p>"Dear old Philip!" said the child;
and then, turning to her mother, she
added,</p>

<p>"Just now, mother, you waked me
from a frightful dream. I thought
that the man who has our father's
estates was dead; but he came from
the dead, and was trying to kill Paulus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
my brother there; and for that
purpose was striving to wrest the
sword from Paulus's hand; and that
the man, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lar</i>, laughed in a hideous
manner, and cried out, 'It is with
his own sword we will slay him! Nothing
but his own sword!'"</p>

<p>The old freedman turned pale, and
muttered something to himself, as he
stood by the side of the vehicle; and
while he kept the horses steady, with
the long reins in his left hand, glanced
awfully toward Paulus.</p>

<p>"Brother," continued the child, "I
forget that man's name. What <em>is</em> the
name?"</p>

<p>"Never mind the name now," said
Paulus; "a dead person cannot kill
a living one; and that man is not in
Italy who will kill me with my own
sword, if I be not asleep. Look at
the beautiful land! See, as Philip
tells you, the beautiful land where you
are going to be so happy."</p>

<p>The river Liris, now the Garigliano,
flowed all gold in the western sun;
some dozen of meadows behind them,
between rows of linden-trees, oleanders,
and pomegranates, with laurel,
bay, and long bamboo-like reeds of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arundo donax</i>, varying the rich
beauty of its banks: "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Daphrones,
platanones, et aÃ«riÃ¦ cyparissi.</i>" A
thin and irregular forest of great contemplative
trees; flowerless and sad
beech, cornel, alder, ash, hornbeam,
and yew towered over savannahs of
scented herbs, and glades of many-tinted
grasses. Some clumps of chestnut-trees,
hereafter to spread into forests,
but then rare, and cultivated
as we cultivate oranges and citrons,
stood proudly apart. A vegetation,
which has partly vanished, gave its
own physical aspect to an Italy the
social conditions of which have vanished
altogether; and were even then
passing, and about to pass, through
their last appearances. But much
also that we in our days have seen,
both there and elsewhere, was there
then. The flower or blossom of the
pomegranate lifted its scarlet light
amidst vines and olives; miles of
oleander trees waved their masses of
flame under the tender green filigree
of almond groves, and seemed to
laugh in scorn at the mourning groups
of yew, and the bowed head of the
dark, widow-like, and inconsolable
cypress. All over the leaves of the
woods autumn had strewn its innumerable
hues. In the west, the sky
was hung with those glories which no
painter ever reproduced and no poet
ever sang; it was one of the sunsets
which make all persons of sensibility
who contemplate them dumb, by
making all that can be said of them
worse than useless. A magnificent and
enormous villa, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castellum</i>, or country
mansion&mdash;palace it seemed&mdash;showed
parts of its walls, glass windows,
and Ionic columns, through the woods
on the banks of the Liris; and upon
the roof of this palace a great
company of gilt, tinted, and white
statues, much larger than life, in various
groups and attitudes, as they
conversed, lifted their arms, knelt,
prayed, stooped, stood up, threatened,
and acted, were glittering above
the tree-tops in the many-colored lights
of the setting sun.</p>

<p>"Ah! let us stop; let us rest a few
moments," cried the child, smiling
through her tears at the smiles of nature
and the enchanting beauty of
the scene; "only a few moments under
the great trees, mother."</p>

<p>It was a group of chestnuts, a few
yards from the side of the road; and
beneath them came to join the highway
through the meadows, and vineyards,
and forest-land, a broad beaten
track from the direction of the splendid
villa that stood on the Liris.</p>

<p>Paulus instantly sprang from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carruca</i>, and, having first helped his
mother to alight, took his sister in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
arms and placed her sitting under the
green shade. A Thracian woman,
a slave, descended meantime from
the box, and the driver drew his
vehicle to the side of the highway.</p>

<p>While they thus reposed, with no
sound about them, as they thought,
save the rustle of the leaves, the distant
ripple of the waters, and the vehement
shrill call of the cicala, hidden
in the grass somewhere near, their
destinies were coming. The freedman
suddenly held up his hand, and
drew their attention by that peculiar
sound through the teeth, (<i>st</i>,) which
in all nations signifies <em>listen!</em></p>

<p>And, indeed, a distant, dull, vague
noise was now heard southward, and
seemed to increase and approach
along the Appian road. Every eye
in our little group of travellers was
turned in the direction mentioned,
and they could see a white cloud of
dust coming swiftly northward. Soon
they distinguished the tramp of many
horses at the trot. Then, over the
top of a hill which had intercepted
the view, came the gleam of arms,
filling the whole width of the way,
and advancing like a torrent of light.
The ground trembled; and, headed
by a troop or two of Numidian riders,
and then a couple of troops or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">turmÃ¦</i> of Batavian cavalry, a thousand
horse, at least, of the PrÃ¦torian
Guards, arrayed, as usual, magnificently,
swept along in a column two
hundred deep, with a rattle and ring
of metal rising treble upon the ear
over the continuous bass of the beating
hoofs, as the foam floats above
the roll of the waves.</p>

<p>The young girl was at once startled
from the sense of sickness and
grief, and gazed with big eyes at the
pageant. Six hundred yards further
on a trumpet-note, clear and long,
gave some sudden signal, and the
whole body instantly halted. From
a detached group in the rear an officer
now rode toward the front; a
loud word or two of command was
heard, a slight movement followed,
and then, as if the column were some
monstrous yellow-scaled serpent with
an elastic neck and a black head,
the swarthy troops which had led the
advance wheeled slowly backward,
two instead of five abreast, while the
main column simultaneously stretched
itself forward on a narrower face,
and with a deeper file, occupying
thus less than half the width of the
road, which they had before nearly
filled, and extending much further onward.
Meantime the squadrons which
had led it continued to defile to the
rear; and when their last rank had
passed the last of those fronting in
the opposite direction, they suddenly
faced to their own right, and, standing
like statues, lined the way on the
side opposite to that where our travellers
were reposing, but some forty
or fifty yards higher up the road, or
more north.</p>

<p>In front of the line of horsemen,
who, after wheeling back, had been
thus faced to their own right, or the
proper left of the line of march, was
now collected a small group of mounted
officers. One of them wore a steel
corselet, a casque of the same metal,
with a few short black feathers in its
crest, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chlamys</i>, or a better sort
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sagum</i>, the scarlet mantle of a military
tribune, over a black tunic, upon
which two broad red stripes or ribbons
were diagonally sewn. This
costume denoted him one of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laticlavii</i>,
or broad-ribboned tribunes; in
other words&mdash;although, to judge by
the massive gold ring which glittered
on the forefinger of his bridle hand, he
might have been originally and personally
only a knight&mdash;he had received
either from the emperor, or from
one of the two CÃ¦sars then governing
with and under Augustus, the senatorial
rank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The chlamys was fastened across
the top of his chest with a silver clasp,
and the tunic a little lower down with
another, both being open below as
far as the waist, and disclosing a
tight-fitting chain-mail corselet, or
shirt of steel rings. The chlamys was
otherwise thrown loose over his shoulders,
but the tunic was belted round
the corselet at his waist by a buff girdle,
wherein hung the intricately-figured
brass scabbard of a straight, flat, not
very long cut-and-thrust sword, which
he now held drawn in his right hand.
In his belt were stuck a pair of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manicÃ¦</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chirothecÃ¦</i>, as gloves were
called, which seemed to be made of
the same material as the girdle; buffalo-skin
greaves on his legs and half-boots
(the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calcei</i>, not the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">soleÃ¦</i> or sandals)
completed his dress. He was a
handsome man, about five-and-thirty
years old, brown hair, an open but
thoughtful face, and an observant eye.
He it was who had ridden to the front,
and given those orders the execution
of which we have noticed. He had
now returned, and kept his horse a
neck or so behind that of an officer
far more splendidly attired, who seemed
to pay no attention whatever to the
little operation that had occurred, but,
shading his eyes with one hand from
the rays of the setting sun, gazed over
the fields toward the villa or mansion
on the Liris.</p>

<p>He was clad in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paludamentum</i>,
the long scarlet cloak of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatus</i> or
general, the borders being deeply
fringed with twice-dyed Tyrian purple,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyria bis tincta</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dibapha</i>, as it is
called by Pliny;) the long folds
of which flowed over his charger's
haunches. This magnificent mantle
was buckled round the wearer's neck
with a jewel. His corselet, unlike that
of the colonel or tribune already mentioned,
was of plate-steel, (instead of
rings,) and shone like a looking-glass,
except where it was inlaid with broad
lines of gold. He wore a chain of
twisted gold round his neck, and his
belt as well as the hilt of his sword,
which remained undrawn by his side
in a silver scabbard, glittered with sardonyx
and jasper stones. He had
no tunic. His gloves happening, like
those of his subordinate, to be thrust
into the belt round his waist, left visible
a pair of hands so white and delicate
as to be almost effeminate. His
helmet was thin steel, and the crest
was surmounted by a profuse plume
of scarlet cock's feathers. But perhaps
the most curious particular of his
costume was a pair of shoes or half-boots
of red leather, the points of the
toes turned upward. These boots
were encrusted with gems, which formed
the patrician crescent, or letter C,
on the top of each foot, and then
wandered into a fanciful tracery of
sparkles up the leg. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stapedÃ¦</i>, or
stirrups, in which his feet rested, were
either of gold or gilt.</p>

<p>The countenance of the evidently
important personage whose dress has
been stated was remarkable. He had
regular features, a handsome straight
nose, eyes half closed with what seemed
at first a languid look, but yet
a look which, if observed more closely,
was almost startling from the extreme
attention it evinced, and from
the contrast between such an expression
and the indolent indifference or
superciliousness upon the surface, if
I may so say, of the physiognomy.
There was something sinister and
cruel about the mouth. He wore no
whiskers or beard, but a black, carefully-trimmed
moustache.</p>

<p>After a steady gaze across the fields
in the direction we have already more
than once mentioned, he half turned
his head toward the tribune, and at
the same time, pointing to our travellers,
said something. The tribune,
in his turn, addressed the first centurion,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dux legionis</i>,) an officer whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sword, like that of the legatus, was
undrawn, but who carried in his right
hand a thin wand made of vine-wood.
In an instant this officer turned his
horse's head and trotted smartly toward
our travellers, upon reaching
whom he addressed Paulus thus:</p>

<p>"Tell me, I pray you, have you
been long here?"</p>

<p>"Not a quarter of an hour," answered
Paulus, wondering why such
a question was asked.</p>

<p>"And have any persons passed into
the road by this pathway?" the
centurion then inquired.</p>

<p>"Not since we came," said Paulus.</p>

<p>The officer thanked him and trotted
back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Paulus and his mother
and the freedman Philip had not
been so absorbed in watching the occurrence
and scene just described as
to remove their eyes for more than
a moment at a time from their dearly-loved
charge, the interesting little
mourner who had begged to be allowed
to rest under the chestnut-trees.
It was not so with Agatha herself.
The child was at once astonished, bewildered,
and enraptured. Had the
spectacle and review before her been
commanded by some monarch, or
rather some magician, on purpose to
snatch her from the possibility of
dwelling longer amidst the gloom,
the regrets, and the terrors under
which she had appeared to be sinking,
neither the wonder of the spectacle,
nor the amenity of the evening
when it occurred, nor the loveliness
of the landscape which formed its
theatre, could have been more opportunely
combined. She had not only
never beheld any thing so magnificent,
but her curiosity was violently
aroused.</p>

<p>Paulus exchanged with his mother
and the old freedman a glance of intelligence
and of intense satisfaction,
as they both noted the parted lips
and dilated eyes with which the child,
half an hour ago so alarmingly ill,
contemplated the drama at which she
was accidentally assisting.</p>

<p>"<i>That's a rare doctor</i>," whispered
Philip, pointing to the general of the
PrÃ¦torian Guards.</p>

<p>"No doctor," replied Paulus in the
same low tones, "could have prescribed
for our darling better."</p>

<p>"Paulus," said Agatha, "what are
these mighty beings? Are these the
genii, and the demons of the mistress-land,
the gods of Italy?"</p>

<p>"They are a handful of Italy's
troops, dear," he said.</p>

<p>She looked from her brother to the
lady, and then to the freedman, and
this last, with a healing instinct which
would have done honor to Hippocrates,
began to stimulate her interest
by the agency of suspense and mystery.</p>

<p>"Master Paulus, and Lady Aglais,
and my little one too," he said, in a
most impressive and solemn voice,
"these be the genii and these be the
demons indeed; but I tell you that
you have not yet seen all the secret.
<i>Something is going to happen.</i> Attend
to me well! You behold a most singular
thing! Are you aware of what
you behold? Yonder, Master Paulus,
is the allotted portion of horse for
more than three legions: the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">justus
equitatus</i>, I say, for a Roman army
of twenty thousand men. Yes, I attest
all the gods," continued Philip in
a low voice, but with great earnestness,
and glancing from the brother
to the sister as if his prospects in life
were contingent upon his being believed
in this. "I was at the battle
of Philippi, and I aver that yonder
is more than the right allotment of
horse for three legions. Observe the
squadrons, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">turmÃ¦</i>; they do not
consist of the same arm; and instead
of being distributed in bodies of three
or four hundred each to a legion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
they are all together before you without
their legions. Why is that, Master
Paulus?"</p>

<p>"I know not," said Paulus.</p>

<p>"Ah!" resumed the freedman, "you
know not, but you <em>will</em> know presently.
Mark that, little Mistress
Agatha, and bear in mind that Philip
the freedman has said to your brother
that he will know all presently."</p>

<p>The child gazed wonderingly at
the troops as she heard these mysterious
words. "Who are those?"
asked she, pointing to the squadrons
of those still in column. "Who are
those in leather jerkins, covered with
the iron scales, and riding the large,
heavy horses?"</p>

<p>"Batavians from the mouths of the
Rhine and the Scheldt," answered the
freedman, with a mysterious shake of
the head.</p>

<p>"And those," pursued she, with increasing
interest; "who are those
whose faces shine like dusky copper,
and whose eyes glitter like the eyes
of the wild animals in the arena,
when the proconsul of Greece gives
the shows? I mean those who ride
the small, long-tailed horses without
any <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ephippia</i> (saddle-cloths,) and even
without bridles&mdash;the soldiers in flowing
dress, with rolls of linen round
their heads?"</p>

<p>"They are the Numidians," replied
Philip. "Ah! Rome dreaded those
horsemen once, when Hannibal the
Carthaginian and his motley hordes
had their will in these fair plains."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a strange movement
occurred. The general or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatus</i> dismounted,
and, giving the bridle of
his horse to a soldier, began to walk
slowly up and down the side of the
road. No sooner had his foot touched
the ground than the whole of the
Numidian squadron seemed to rise
like a covey out of a stubble field;
with little clang of arms, but with
one short, sharp cry, or whoop, it
burst from the high road into the
meadow land. There the evolutions
which they performed seemed at first
to be all confusion, only for the fact
that, although the horsemen had the
air of riding capriciously in every direction,
crossing, intermingling, separating,
galloping upon opposite curves,
and tracing every figure which the
whim and fancy of each might dictate,
yet no two of them ever came
into collision. Indeed, fantastic and
wild as that rhapsody of man&oelig;uvres
into which they had broken appeared
to be, some principle which was thoroughly
understood by every one of
them governed their mazy gallop. It
was as accurate and exact as some
stately dance of slaves at the imperial
court. It was, in short, itself a wild
dance of the Numidian cavalry, in
which their reinless horses, guided
only by the flashing blades and the
voices of their riders, manifested the
most vehement spirit and a sort of
sympathetic frenzy. These steeds,
which never knew the bridle, and
went thus mouth-free even into battle&mdash;these
horses, which their masters
turned loose at night into the fields,
and which came back bounding and
neighing at the first call, were now
madly plunging, wheeling, racing, and
charging, like gigantic dogs at sport.
Presently they began to play a strange
species of leap-frog. A Numidian
boy, who carried a trumpet and rode
a pony, or at least a horse smaller
and lower than the rest of the barbs,
("Berber horses,") suddenly halted
upon the outside of the mad cavalry
whirlpool which had been formed,
and flung himself flat at full length
upon the back of the diminutive animal.
Instantly the whirl, as it circled
toward him, straightened itself
into a column, and every horseman
rode full upon the stationary pony,
and cleared both steed and rider
at a bound, a torrent of cavalry rushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
over the obstruction with wild
shouts.</p>

<p>"That is Numidian sport, Master
Paulus," said the freedman; "but
there is not a rider among them to be
compared to yourself."</p>

<p>"Certainly I can ride," said the
youth; "but I pretend not to be superior
to these Centaurs."</p>

<p>"Be these, then, the Centaurs I
have heard of?" asked Agatha; "be
these the wild powers?"</p>

<p>The hubbub had prevented her,
and all with her, from noticing something.
Before an answer could be
given, the Numidians had returned
to the highway as suddenly as they
had quitted it, and the noise of their
dance was succeeded by a pause of
attention. The general was again on
horseback, and our travellers perceived
that two litters, one of carved
ivory and gold, the other of sculptured
bronze, borne on the shoulders of
slaves, were beside them.</p>

<p>Two gentlemen on foot had arrived
with the litters along the broad
pathway already noticed, and a group
of attendants at a little distance were
following.</p>

<p>This new party were now halting
with our travellers beneath the far-spreading
shade of the same trees.
In the ivory litter reclined a girl of
about seventeen, dressed in a long
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palla</i> of blue silk, a material then only
just introduced from India, through
Arabia and Egypt, and so expensive
as to be beyond the reach of any but
the richest class. Her hair, which
was of a bright gold color, was dressed
in the fashionable form of a helmet,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">galerus</i>,) and was inclosed behind
in a gauze net. She wore large
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inaures</i>, or ear-rings, of some jewel,
a gold chain, in every ring of which
was set a gem, and scarlet shoes embroidered
with pearls. The lady in
the bronze litter was attired in the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stola</i> of a matron, with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cyclas</i>, or
circular robe, thrown back from the
neck, and a tunic of dark purple
which descended to her feet. Her
brown hair was restrained by bands,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vittÃ¦</i>, which had an honorable significance
among the Roman ladies,
("<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nil mihi cum vitta</i>," says the profligate
author of the <cite>Ars Amandi</cite>.)
She seemed somewhat past thirty
years of age; she had a very sweet,
calm, and matronly air; her countenance
was as beautiful in features and
general effect as it was modest in its
tone and character.</p>

<p>Her companion,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in the litter of
ivory and gold, was not more than
half her age, was even more beautiful,
with an immense wreath of golden
hair, and with large blue eyes,
darkening to the likeness of black as
she gazed earnestly upon any object.
But she had a less gentle physiognomical
expression. Frequently her
look was penetrating, brief, impatient,
sarcastic, disdainful. She had a bewitching
smile, however, and her numerous
admirers made Italy echo
with their ravings.</p>

<p>Lucius Varius, said the fashionable
world, was at that very time engaged
upon a kind of sapphic ode, of which
she was to be the subject.</p>

<p>Scarcely had these litters or palanquins
arrived and halted, when the
general officer dismounted once more,
and walked quickly toward the spot
with his helmet in his hand. At a
few yards' distance he stopped, and
first bowed low to the elder of the
two gentlemen who had accompanied
the litters on foot, and then, almost
entirely disregarding the other gentleman,
made an obeisance not quite so
long or so deep to the ladies. The
man whom so splendid a personage
as the legatus, wearing his flaming
paludamentum, and at the head of
his troops, thus treated with so obsequious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>a veneration, did not return
the salute except by a slight nod and
a momentary, absent-minded smile.
His gaze had been riveted upon our
travellers, and chiefly upon the youth
and his young, suffering sister, upon
both of whom, after it had quickly
taken in Philip the freedman, the
Thracian woman, and the Athenian
lady, it rested long&mdash;longest and last
upon Agatha.</p>

<p>"Sejanus," said he finally, "who
are these?"</p>

<p>"I never saw them until just now,
my commander and CÃ¦sar; they
were here when we halted, and while
we waited for our master, the favorite
of the gods, these travellers seemed
to be resting where you behold
them."</p>

<p>"As those gods favor me," said the
other, "this is a fine youth. Can we
not <i>edit</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> him? And yonder girl&mdash;have
you ever seen, my Sejanus, such
eyes? But she is deadly pale. Are
you always thus pale, pretty one, or
are you merely ill? If but ill, as I
guess, Charicles, my Greek physician,
shall cure you."</p>

<p>Before this man had even spoken,
the moment, indeed, when first his
eyes fell upon her, Agatha had sidled
close to her mother; and while he
was expressing himself in that way to
Sejanus, she returned his gaze with
panic-stricken, dilated eyes, as the
South American bird returns that of
the reptile; but when he directly
questioned her, she, reaching out her
hand to Paulus, clutched his arm
with a woman's grasp, and said in an
affrighted voice,</p>

<p>"My brother, let us go."</p>

<p>Paulus, in a manner naturally easy,
and marked by the elegance and grace
which the athletic training of Athens
had given to one so well endowed
physically, first, merely saying to the
stranger, "I crave your pardon,"
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">veniam posco</i>,) lifted Agatha with one
arm, and placed her in the travelling
carriage. Then, while the freedman
and the Thracian slave mounted to
their bench, he returned to where his
mother stood, signed to her to follow
Agatha, and, seeing her move calmly
but quickly toward the vehicle, he
took the broad-rimmed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">petasus</i> from
his head, and bowing slowly and lowly
to the stranger, said,</p>

<p>"Powerful sir, for I observe you
are a man of great authority, my sister
is too ill to converse. You rightly
guessed this; permit us to take her
to her destination."</p>

<p>The man whom he had thus balked,
and to whom he now thus spoke,
merits a word of description. He
appeared to be more than fifty years
old. The mask of his face and the
frame of his head were large, but not
fat. His complexion was vivid brick-red
all over the cheeks, with a deeper
flush in one spot on each side, just
below the outer corners of the eyes.
The eyes were bloodshot, large, rather
prominent, and were closely set
together. The nose was large, long,
bony, somewhat aquiline. The forehead
was not high, not low; it was
much developed above the eyes, and
it was broad. A deep and perpetual
dint just over the nose reached half-way
up the forehead. His hair was
grizzled and close cut. His lips were
full and fleshy, and the mouth was
wide; the jaws were large and massive.
His face was shaven of all
hair. The chin was very handsome
and large, and the whole head was
set upon a thick, strong throat, not
stunted, however, of its proper length.
In person this man was far from ungainly,
nor yet was he handsome. In
carriage and bearing, without much
majesty, he had nevertheless something
steadfast, weighty, unshrinking,
and commanding. His outer garment,
not a toga, was all one color and
material; it was a long, thick wadded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
silk mantle, of that purple dye which
is nearly black&mdash;the hue, indeed, of
clotted gore under a strong light. He
wore gloves, and instead of the usual
short sword of the Romans, had a
long steel stylus<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> for writing on wax
thrust into a black leathern belt. This
instrument seemed to show that he
lived much in Rome, where it was
not the custom, when otherwise in
civilian dress, to go armed.</p>

<p>As the reader will have guessed,
this man was to be the next emperor
of the Roman world.</p>

<p>"Permit you to take her to her
destination?" he repeated slowly.
"My Greek physician, I tell you,
shall cure her. I will give directions
about your destination." A slight
pause; then, "Are you a Roman citizen?"</p>

<p>"I am a Roman knight as well as
citizen," answered Paulus proudly;
"and my family is not only equestrian,
but patrician."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Paulus Ãmilius Lepidus."</p>

<p>The man in the black or gore-colored
purple glanced at Sejanus, who,
still unconcerned, stood with his splendid
helmet in the left hand, while he
smoothed his moustache with the
right; otherwise perfectly still, his
handsome face, cruel mouth, and intelligent
eyes all alive with the keenest
attention.</p>

<p>"And the destination to which
you allude is&mdash;?" pursued the man in
black purple.</p>

<p>"FormiÃ¦," said Paulus.</p>

<p>"What relation or kinship exists
between you and Marcus Ãmilius
Lepidus, formerly the triumvir, who
still enjoys the life which he owes to
the clemency of Augustus?"</p>

<p>Paulus hesitated. When he had
given his name, the younger of the
two ladies had raised herself suddenly
in the litter of ivory and gold, and
fastened upon him a searching gaze,
which she had not since removed.
The other lady had also at that instant
looked at him fixedly. We have
already stated that, when Sejanus approached
the group, he had not deigned
in any very cordial manner to salute
or notice the second of the two
gentlemen who had accompanied the
litters on foot. This gentleman was
very sallow, had hollow eyes, and a
habit of gnawing his under lip between
his teeth. He had unbuckled his
sword, and had given it, calling out,
"<i>Lygdus, carry this</i>," to a man with
an exceedingly sinister and repulsive
countenance. The man in question
had now taken a step or two forward,
and was standing on the left of Paulus,
fronting the CÃ¦sar, his shoulders
stooping, his neck bent forward, his
eyes without any motion of the head
rolling incessantly from person to
person, and face to face, but at once
falling before and avoiding any glance
which happened to meet his. He
looked askant and furtively at every
object with an eager, unhappy, and
malign expression. Paulus did not
need to turn his head to feel that this
man was now intently peering at him.
Behind the two courtly palanquins,
and beyond the shade of the trees,
was a third litter still more costly,
being covered in parts with plate
gold. Here sat a woman with a face
as white as alabaster, and large prominent
black eyes, watching the scene,
and apparently trying to catch every
word that was said.</p>

<p>Paulus, as we have observed, hesitated.
The training of youth in the
days of classic antiquity soon obliterated
the inferiority of unreasoning,
nervous shyness. But the strange
catechism which Paulus was now undergoing,
with all this gaze upon him
from so many eyes, began to be a
nuisance, and to tell upon a spirit
singularly high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you heard my question?"
inquired Tiberius.</p>

<p>"I have heard it," replied Paulus;
"and have heard and answered several
others, without knowing who he
is that asks them. However, the
former triumvir, now living at CircÃ¦i,
about forty thousand paces from here,
is my father's brother." (CircÃ¦i, as
the reader knows, is now called Monte
Circello, a promontory just opposite
Gaeta.)</p>

<p>When Paulus had given his last
answer, the ladies glanced at each
other, and the younger looked long
and hard at Tiberius. Getting some
momentary signal from him, she threw
herself back in her palanquin and smiled
meaningly at the stooping, sinister-faced
man, who had stationed himself
in the manner already mentioned near
Paulus's left hand.</p>

<p>"Your father," rejoined Tiberius,
after a pause, "was a very distinguished
soldier, and, as I always heard
when a boy, he contributed eminently
to the victory of Philippi. But I
knew not that he had children; and,
moreover, was he not slain, pray, at
Philippi, toward the end of the battle,
which he certainly helped to gain?"</p>

<p>"I hope," said Paulus, somewhat
softened by the praise of his father,
"I hope that Augustus supposed him
to have died of his wounds, and that
it was only under this delusion he
gave our estates&mdash;which were situated
somewhere in this very province
of Campania, with a noble mansion
like the castellum upon the river yonder&mdash;to
that brave and able soldier
Agrippa Vespasianus."</p>

<p>At this name a deep red flush over-spread
the brow of Tiberius, and Paulus
innocently proceeded.</p>

<p>"Certainly, the noble Agrippa, who
was to have been CÃ¦sar, had he lived,
never would have accepted so unfair
a bounty had he known that my
father really survived his wounds, but
that&mdash;despairing of the generosity, or
rather despairing of the equity of Augustus&mdash;he
was living a melancholy,
exheridated exile, near that very battle-field
of Philippi, in Thrace, where
he had fought so well and had been
left for dead."</p>

<p>"You dare to term the act of Augustus,"
slowly said the man in the
gore-colored purple cloak, "<i>so unfair
a bounty</i>, and Augustus himself <i>ungenerous,
or rather unjust</i>?"</p>

<p>At this terrible rejoinder from such
a man, the down-looking person whom
we have mentioned passed his right
hand stealthily to the hilt of the sword
which he was carrying for his master,
and half drew it. Paulus, who for
some time had had this person standing
at his left, could observe the action
without turning his head. He
was perfectly aware, moreover, that,
should the other draw his weapon
upon him, the very act of drawing it
would itself become a blow, on account
of their respective places, whereas
to escape it required more distance
between them, and to parry it in a
regular way would demand quite a
different position, besides the needful
moment or two for disengaging his
own rather long blade. Yet the youth
stood completely still; he never even
turned his head. However, he just
shifted the wide-rimmed hat from his
left to his right hand (the hand for
the sword) and thereby seemed to be
only more encumbered, unprepared,
and defenceless than before. His left
hand, with the back inward, fell also
meantime in an easy and natural way
upon the emerald haft of the outlandish-looking
three-edged rapier, which,
as he played with it, became loose
in the scabbard, and <i>came and went</i>
some fraction of an inch.</p>

<p>"I never termed him so," said Paulus.
"I said not this of Augustus.
I am at this moment on my way to
Augustus himself, who is, I am told,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to be at FormiÃ¦ with his court for a
week or two. I must, therefore, again
ask your leave, mighty office-bearer,
to continue my journey. I know not
so much as who you are."</p>

<p>"I am Tiberius CÃ¦sar," said the
other, bending upon him those closely-set,
prominent, bloodshot eyes with
no very assuring expression. "I am
Tiberius CÃ¦sar, and you will be pleased
to wait one moment before you
continue the journey in question. The
accusation against your father was
this: that, after Philippi, he labored
for the interests first of Sextus, the son
of Pompey, and afterward of Mark
Antony, in their respective impious
and parricidal struggles; and the answer
to this charge (a charge to
which witnesses neither were nor are
wanting) has always been, that it was
simply impossible, seeing that Paulus
Lepidus, your father, perished at Philippi
before the alleged treasons had
occurred. Wherefore, as your father
had done good service, especially in
the great battle where he was thus
supposed to have fallen, not only was
his innocence declared certain, but, for
his memory's sake, Marcus Lepidus,
the triumvir, your uncle, was forgiven.
Yet now we learn from you, the son
of the accused, that the only defence
ever made for him is positively false;
that your father, were he still living,
would probably merit to be put to
death; and that your uncle, at the
same time, is stripped of the one protecting
circumstance which has preserved
his head. I must order your
arrest, and that of all your party, in
order that these things may be at least
fully investigated."</p>

<p>As this was said, the lady in the litter
of ivory and gold contemplated
Paulus with that bewitching smile
which she was accustomed to bestow
upon dying gladiators in the hippodrome;
while the other lady gazed at
him with a compassionate, forecasting
and muse-like look.</p>

<p>"I mean no disrespect whatever to
so great a man as you, sir; but I will,"
said Paulus, "appeal from Tiberius
CÃ¦sar to CÃ¦sar Augustus; to whom, I
again remind you, I am on my way."</p>

<p>No sooner had he uttered the
words, "I appeal from Tiberius," than,
before he could finish the sentence,
the malign-faced man on his left
with great suddenness drew the sword
hew as carrying for Cneius Piso, and,
availing himself of the first natural
sweep of the weapon as it left the
scabbard, sought to bring the edge of
it backward across the face of Paulus,
exclaiming, while he did so, "<i>Speak
you thus to CÃ¦sar?</i>"</p>

<p>Had this man, who was the future
assassin of Drusus, and slave to Cneius
Piso, who was the future assassin of Germanicus,
succeeded in delivering that
well-meant stroke, the sentence which
our hero was addressing to Tiberius
could never have been said out; but
said out, as we see, it was, and said,
too, with due propriety of emphasis,
although with a singular accompanying
delivery. In fact, though not
deigning to look round toward this
man, Paulus had been vividly aware
of his movements, and, swift as was
the attack, the defence was truly electrical.
Paulus's rapier, the hilt of
which, as we have remarked, had
been for some time in his left hand,
leapt from its sheath, and being first
held almost perpendicularly for one
moment, the point down and the hilt
a little higher than his forehead, met
the murderous blow at right angles;
after which the delicate long blade
flashed upward, with graceful ease
but irresistible violence, bearing the
assassin's weapon backward upon a
small semi-circle, and remaining inside
of it, or, in other words, nearer to
Lygdus's body than Piso's own sword,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
which he carried, was. It looked like
a mere continuation of this dazzling
parry, but was, in truth, a vigorous
deviation from it, which none but a
very pliant and powerful wrist could
have executed; when the emerald
pommel fell like a hammer upon the
forehead of Lygdus the slave, whom
that disdainful blow stretched at his
length upon the ground, motionless,
and to all appearance dead. As Piso
was standing close, the steel guard of
the hilt, in passing, tore open his brow
and cheek.</p>

<p>The whole occurrence occupied only
five or seven seconds, and meanwhile
the youth finished his sentence with
the words already recorded, "From
Tiberius CÃ¦sar to CÃ¦sar Augustus, to
whom, I again remind you, I am on
my way."</p>

<p>An exclamation of astonishment, and
perhaps some other feeling, escaped
from Tiberius. Sejanus smiled; the
woman with the pale face and black
eyes, who sat in the unadorned plate-of-gold
palanquin, screamed; and the
other ladies laughed loudly. Among
the prÃ¦torian guards, who from the
road were watching with attention the
group where they saw their general
and the CÃ¦sar, a long, low murmur
of approbation ran. At this, Tiberius
turned and looked steadily and
musingly toward them. Paulus, instantly
sheathing his weapon, said,</p>

<p>"I ask CÃ¦sar's pardon, but there
was no time to obtain his permission
for what I have just done. My head
must have been in two pieces had I
waited but one moment."</p>

<p>"Just half a moment for each
piece," said Tiberius; "but your left
hand seems well able to keep your
head. Are you left-handed?"</p>

<p>"No, great CÃ¦sar," said Paulus;
"I am what my Greek teacher of
fence used to call two-handed, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dimachÃ¦rus</i>;
he tried to make all his pupils
so, but my right remains far better
than my left."</p>

<p>"Then I should like to see your right
thoroughly exercised," said Tiberius.</p>

<p>Paulus heard a sweet voice here say,
"As a favor to me, do not order the
arrest of this brave youth;" and, turning,
he beheld the beautiful creature
in the litter of ivory and gold plead
for him with Tiberius. The large
blue eyes, darkening as she supplicated,
smote the youth, and he could
hardly take away his gaze.</p>

<p>"Young man, go forward with your
mother and sister to FormiÃ¦, under
the charge of Velleius Paterculus, the
military tribune whom you see yonder
upon the road. Remain in FormiÃ¦
till I give you leave to quit it.
Report your place of residence to the
tribune. Go!"</p>

<p>The last word was pronounced
harshly. Tiberius made a signal with
his hand to Paterculus. Then passing
his arm through that of Sejanus,
and speaking to him in a low tone, he
led the general aside into the fields to
a little distance; while&mdash;with the exception
of two mounted troopers, (each
leading a horse,) who remained behind,
but considerably out of hearing&mdash;the
prÃ¦torian guards, the three litters,
and the travelling <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">biga</i> began
to move toward FormiÃ¦, leaving the
road to silence, and the evening landscape
to peace.</p>

<p>There is, after all, but slight exaggeration
in the old saying, that a
lie travels leagues while truth is putting
on boots to pursue and overtake
it. And even when overtaken, caught,
and choked, how hard it dies! In
our daily experience, how often does
truthful exposure utterly extinguish
false and evil report? Certainly not
always, and probably but very seldom.
In the intercourse of society,
one may partially crush out a calumny
by going straight to those who
should know the truth and compelling
them to listen to it.</p>

<p>But the lie historical cannot be so
met. People in this busy world have
no time to spend in reading long documents
in vindication of men or women
long since dead. But they have
read the calumny? Certainly. The
calumny is not so long as the refutation,
and is more readable. It is attractive;
it is piquant. Mary Stuart
as an adulteress and a murderess is an
interesting character. People never
tire of hearing of her. But Mary
Stuart, the upright queen, the noble
and true woman, the faithful spouse
and affectionate mother, has but slight
attractions for the mass of readers.
To hear her so proven must be dull
reading. Nevertheless, with time
comes truth; for although</p>

<p>which we take to be only a modern,

every Sunday at vespers,</p>

<p class="center">
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et justitia ejus manet in seculum seculi.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p>Look at the Galileo story. Galileo
died more than two hundred years
ago. Yet it is only within a lifetime
that the truth concerning him began
to dawn upon the English mind.</p>

<p>Mary Queen of Scots surrendered
her soul to God and her head to
Elizabeth nearly three centuries ago,
and the combat over her reputation
to-day rages as hot as ever. In the
case of the Florentine astronomer,
there has been no strongly decided
hereditary transmission of the falsehood.
In that of the Queen of Scotland
every inch of ground is obstinately
fought, because her innocence
means the shame of England, the
disgrace of Knox, the condemnation
of the ornaments of the Anglican and
Puritan churches, and the infamy of
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>These enemies of Mary yet live in
transmitted prejudices and powerful
hereditary interests. The very existence
of all the boasting, pride, false
reputation, hypocritical piety, and
national vanity represented by the familiar
catchwords of "Our Noble
Harry," "Glorious Queen Bess," "The
Virgin Queen," "Our Sainted Reformers,"
has its inspiration and life-breath
in the maintenance of every
calumny against Mary Stuart and the
Catholic Church of that day; and
we must do these supporters the credit
of admitting that they are instant
in season and out of season, and
never weary in their work.</p>

<p>But their case was long since made
up. They have said their last word,
and shot all the arrows of their quiver.
With each succeeding year Elizabeth's
reputation fails, and is rapidly
passing into disgrace. With the
same rapidity Mary's fame grows
brighter.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The books and pamphlets written
in attack or defence of Mary would
of themselves form a library. For the
attack, the key-note is to be found in
Cecil's avowed principle concerning
the treatment of the dethroned queen,
that <i>their purpose could not be obtained
without disgracing her</i>. Hence, the
silver-casket letters, and the so-called
confessions of Paris. Hence, the issue,
during every year of her long
imprisonment of eighteen years, of
some vile pamphlet, under Cecil's instructions,
calculated to blast her character.
Two men in particular powerfully
contributed to defame the
Queen of Scots&mdash;John Knox and
George Buchanan. Knox by his
sermons, in which, says Russel, (<cite>History
of the Reformation</cite>, vol. i. p. 292,)
"lying strives with rage;" Buchanan,
by his writings, which have been made
by Mary's enemies one of the sources
of history. Buchanan was an apostate
monk, saved from the gallows
by Mary, and loaded with her favors.
An eye-witness of her dignity, her
goodness, and her purity, he afterward
described her as the vilest of women.
He sold his pen to Elizabeth, and
has been properly described as "unrivalled
in baseness, peerless in falsehood,
supreme in ingratitude." His
<cite>Detection</cite> was published (1570) in Latin,
and copies were immediately sent
by Cecil to Elizabeth's ambassador
in Paris with instructions to circulate
them; "<i>for they will come to good effect
to disgrace her, which must be done
before other purposes can be obtained</i>."</p>

<p>This shameful work has been the
inspiration of most of the portraits
drawn of Mary. De Thou in France,
Spotiswoode, Jebb, and many others
in England, have all followed him.
Holinshed too was deceived by Buchanan;
but it is doubtful if he dared
write otherwise than he did, between
the terrors of Cecil's spies and Elizabeth's
mace.</p>

<p>An English translation of Buchanan
was first published in 1690, being
called forth by the revolution of 1688.
Jebb's two folio volumes appeared in
1725.</p>

<p>Two additional lives of Mary, by
Heywood (1725) and Freebairn, were
little more than translations from the
French. In 1726, Edward Simmons
published Mary's forged letters as
genuine. Anderson's voluminous collection
of papers (four large volumes)
appeared in 1727 and 1728. Meantime,
from the accession of a new
dynasty and the rebellion of 1715,
there arose in Edinburgh a sort of
society having for its principal object
the work of supporting Buchanan's
credit and vilifying the Scottish queen.
Later came the well-known and widely
published histories of Scotland and
of England by Robertson and Hume,
which, read wherever the English language
was known, may be said to
have popularized the culpability of
Mary. Until within comparatively
few years, Hume's work was the only
history of England generally read in
the United States. Then came Malcolm
Laing, who imagined he had
closed the controversy against Mary
in his bitter <cite>Dissertation</cite>. Mignet,
in France, went further than Laing,
while Froude, in his history of England,
distancing all previous writers,
portrays Mary in the blackest colors
as one of the most criminal and devilish
of women. For his material
there is no statement so absurd, no
invention so gross, no lie so palpable,
no calumny so vile, provided only
that it be to the prejudice of Mary
Stuart, that does not find favor in his
eyes. In his blind hatred of the Catholic
queen, forgetting all historic
dignity and even personal decency,
he showers upon her such epithets
as "panther," "ferocious animal,"
"wild-cat," "brute;" her persecutors
being white-robed saints, such as "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
pious Cecil," and "the noble and
stainless Murray," and the virgin
Queen Elizabeth appearing "as a
beneficent fairy coming out of the
clouds to rescue an erring sister."</p>

<p>But Mary's cause has not wanted
defenders. Among the best known
are, John Leslie, Bishop of Ross;
Camden and Carte, the English historians;
Herrera, the Spanish bishop;
Robert Keith; Goodall, (1754,) who
made the first searching analysis of
the silver-casket letters, showing that
the French text of the pretended
Bothwell love-letters, until then supposed
to be original, was a poor
translation from the Latin or Scotch.
William Tytler (1759) and John Whitaker
(1788) proved that the letters were
forged by those who produced them.
Stuart, in his history of Scotland,
(1762,) and Mademoiselle Keraglio,
in her <cite>Life of Elizabeth</cite>, (1786,) both
protested against the conclusions
of Hume and Robertson. In 1818,
George Chalmers took up Laing's
book, and proved conclusively, with a
mass of newly-discovered testimony,
that the accusers of Mary were themselves
the murderers of Darnley.
Then followed the learned Dr. Lingard,
Guthrie, and H. Glassford Bell.
But all these works were either too
heavy and cumbrous for popular reading,
or too narrow in their scope;
most of them being better prepared
for reference than for reading, and of
but slight effective service in the field
occupied by Hume and Robertson.
Miss Strickland's work is well known
to all our readers, and has done much
good. In 1866, Mr. McNeel Caird
published <cite>Mary Stuart, her Guilt or
Innocence</cite>, in which he effectively defends
Mary and seriously damages
Mr. Froude's veracity.</p>

<p>A most valuable historical contribution
is the late work (1869) of
M. Jules Gauthier. The first volume
is out and the second will be issued
in a few months. M. Gauthier says
that after reading the work of M. Mignet,
he had no doubt that Queen
Mary had assassinated her husband
in order to avenge the death of Riccio.
"I was, therefore, surprised,"
he continues, "on arriving at Edinburgh,
in 1861, to hear Mary warmly
defended, and reference made to documents
recently discovered that were
strongly in her favor. I then formed
the resolution to study for myself this
historical problem and to discover
the truth. I had no idea of writing
a book, and no motive but that of
satisfying my own curiosity. I have
devoted several years solely to this
object in Scotland, England, and
Spain." M. Gauthier then gives a
formidable list of authorities and manuscripts
not usually quoted, acknowledges
the aid of the librarians of the
legal library at Edinburgh, the learned
Mr. Robertson of the Register
House, Robert Chambers, and the
archivist of Simancas, Don Emanuel
Gonzalez, and announces the result
to be a complete change of opinion.
He goes on to say that, before examining
all the documents of the trial,
he had no doubt of the guilt of Mary
Stuart; but after having scrutinized
and compared them, he remained
and still remains convinced that it
was solely to assure the fruit of their
shameful victory that the barons, who
had dethroned their queen with England's
help, sought to throw upon
her the crimes of which they themselves
were the authors or the accomplices,
and in which their auxiliaries
were Elizabeth and her ministers.</p>

<p>But what is of far greater importance,
M. Gauthier announces the discovery
among the Simancas <span class="smcap lowercase">MSS.</span>
of documents that prove beyond all
question that the silver-casket letters
were forgeries. This important revelation
he promises for the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
volume. Preceding M. Gauthier in
time, M. Wiesener, another French
writer, had, in an admirable <i>critique</i>,
demolished the foundations on which
rest most of the calumnies against
Mary Stuart.</p>

<p>And now we have Mr. Hosack's
work. There is a beautiful poetic
justice in the fact that the most effective
defences of Mary Stuart, in the
English language, come from Protestant
pens, and that in Scotland among
the sons of the Puritans are found
her most enthusiastic advocates. Mr.
Hosack is an Edinburgh lawyer, and
a Protestant.</p>

<p>His book, written in a tone of legal
calmness and dignity, stands in refreshing
contrast with Mr. Froude's
savage bitterness and repulsive violence,
and seriously damages any credit
that may be claimed for the latter
as a historian. Entirely at home in
the customs, localities, laws, and history
of Scotland, he throws unexpected
light on a hundred interesting
points heretofore left in obscurity by
foreign, and even English historians.
Mr. Hosack also produces many valuable
documents never before published.
Among these are the specific charges
preferred against Mary at the conference
at Westminster in 1568. The "Articles"
produced by Mary's accusers
before they exhibited their proofs to
the commissioners of Queen Elizabeth,
although constantly referred to
by historians, are nowhere to be found
among all the voluminous collections
heretofore published on the subject.
Mr. Hosack discovered this valuable
paper in the collection known as the
Hopetoun Manuscripts, which are
now in the custody of the lord clerk
register. Another most interesting
document presented by Mr. Hosack
is one long supposed to be lost, namely,
the journal of the proceedings at
Westminster on the day upon which
the silver casket containing the alleged
letters of Queen Mary to Bothwell
was produced. Then comes the
inventory of the jewels of the Queen
of Scots, attached to her last will and
testament, made in 1566, when Mary
was supposed to be dying. This paper
has been but recently discovered
in the Register House, Edinburgh.
It is of high importance, as throwing
light on a disputed point concerning
Darnley. Finally, with the aid of
Professor Schiern, of Copenhagen, Mr.
Hosack has succeeded in ascertaining
the date of the capture of Nicholas
Hubert, commonly called "French
Paris." This point is also weighty
in connection with the question of the
authenticity of the deposition ascribed
to him. The English critics of
Mr. Hosack's book&mdash;many of them
partisans of Froude, and armed in
the triple steel of their national prejudice&mdash;are
unanimous in praise of
his research, and the able presentation
of his argument. Mr. Hosack
distinctly charges Mr. Froude with
"inventing fictions," and, moreover,
sustains the charge. The aim of Mr.
Hosack's work is not so much to
write the life of Mary Stuart as to
demonstrate that her accusers were
guilty of the very crime (the murder
of Darnley) of which they charge
her, and that she was innocent, not
only of that, but of any intrigue with
Bothwell. Passing over in silence the
period of Mary's residence in France,
our author rapidly glances at the
salient points in the administration
of Mary of Lorraine, the mother of
Mary Stuart, an admirable character,
whose energy, integrity, resolution,
and fortitude would have adorned
the character of the greatest sovereign
that ever reigned. Mr. Hosack thus
speaks of her death:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The words of the dying princess, at
once so magnanimous and gentle, were listened
to with deep emotion by the Protestant
chiefs, who, though in arms against her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
authority, all acknowledged and admired
her private virtues. Amidst the tears of
her enemies, thus died the best and wisest
woman of the age."</p></blockquote>

<p>Knox alone, adds Mr. Hosack,
sought by means of the most loathsome
slanders to vilify the character
of this excellent princess; and it was
no doubt at his instigation that the
rites of Christian burial were denied
to her remains in Scotland. Mr. Hosack
then takes up the history of
Mary from the period of her arrival
in Scotland, and ends with the commencement
of her imprisonment in
England.</p>

<p>Mary came to reign over a country
virtually in the power of a band
of violent and rapacious lords, long
in rebellion against their king. Of
the five royal Jameses, three had perished,
victims of their aristocratic anarchy.
The personal piety of these
rebellious lords was infinitesimal; but
they had an enormous appreciation
of Henry VIII.'s plunder of the
monasteries and division of the church
lands among the nobles, and desired
to see Scotland submitted to the same
regimen&mdash;they, of course, becoming
ardent reformers. The young queen
soon won the hearts of the people
of Edinburgh by her sweetness and
grace. One of her first experiences
was the remarkable interview with
Knox, in which he bore himself as
properly became "the ruffian of the
Reformation," while Mary, a girl of
nineteen, utterly overcame him in self-possession,
logic, and command of
citation from the Old Testament.
The man was brimful of vanity. The
wound rankled, and from that moment
he was Mary Stuart's personal
enemy.</p>

<p>Long before Mary's arrival, Knox
and his friends had obtained full sway.
The reformers had destroyed the
monastic establishments in the central
counties, and, under the influence
of Knox, had an "act" passed for
the total destruction of what they
called "monuments of superstition;"
the monuments of superstition in
question being all that Scotland possessed
of what was most valuable in
art and venerable in architecture.</p>

<p>"The registers of the church,
and the libraries," says Spotiswoode,
"were cast into the fire. In a word,
all was ruined; and what had escaped
in the time of the first tumult, did
now undergo the common calamity."
In his sermons, Knox openly denounced
Mary, not only as an incorrigible
idolatress, but as an enemy
whose death would be a public boon.
In equally savage style he fulminated
against the amusements of the court,
and dwelt especially on the deadly
sin of dancing. And yet Knox&mdash;we
must in candor admit it&mdash;was not totally
indifferent to some social amenities,
for he was then paying his addresses
to a young girl of sixteen,
whom he afterward married. Mary
had freely accorded to her Protestant
subjects the privilege of worshipping
God according to their own
creed; but it did not enter into the
views of Knox and his co-religionists
that the same privilege should be accorded
to Mary in the land of which
she was sovereign, and with great
difficulty could she obtain the right
to a private chapel at Holyrood&mdash;even
this being interfered with, and
the officiating priest afterward insulted,
beaten, and driven away. And
these Christian gentlemen did not stop
here. They had the insolence and
inhumanity to present to the queen
what they called a "supplication,"
in which they declared that the practice
of idolatry could not be tolerated
in the sovereign any more than in
the subject, and that the "papistical
and blasphemous mass" should be
wholly abolished. To this, Mary's
reply was that, answering for herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
she was noways persuaded that there
was any impiety in the mass, and
trusted her subjects would not press
her to act against her conscience; for,
not to dissemble, but to deal plainly
with them, she neither might nor
would forsake the religion wherein
she had been educated and brought
up, believing the same to be the true
religion, and grounded on the word
of God. She further advised her
"loving subjects" that she, "neither
in times past nor yet in time coming,
did intend to force the conscience of
any person; but to permit every one
to serve God in such a manner as
they are persuaded to be the best."
On this, Mr. Hosack remarks, "Nothing
could exceed the savage rudeness
of the language of the assembly.
Nothing could exceed the dignity and
moderation of the queen's reply."</p>

<p>The enemies of Mary Stuart always
seek to find excuse for the rebellious
outrages of the lords and the
kirk in the design attributed to Mary
Stuart of introducing Catholicity to
the exclusion of Protestantism. Mr.
Hosack handles this portion of his
subject with great ease and success,
showing conclusively the admirable
spirit of toleration that animated
Mary throughout. Then follow the
marriage of Mary with Darnley; the
rebellion of Murray, Argyll, and others
to deprive the queen of her crown;
the energy, ability, and admirable
judgment of Mary in dealing with
them, and the consummate hypocrisy
and falsehood of Elizabeth in feigning
good-will to Mary while furnishing
the rebels money and assistance.
The French ambassador in London
had discovered that six thousand
crowns had been sent from the English
treasury to the Scotch rebels.
The fact was positive. He mentioned
it to Elizabeth in person; but she
solemnly assured him, with an oath,
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elle nia avec serment</i>,) that he was
misinformed. There were strong reasons
why Elizabeth would not have
it believed that she had lent the rebel
lords any countenance, and she therefore
got up a remarkable scene for
the purpose. The French and Spanish
ambassadors had charged her in
plain terms with stirring up dissensions
in Scotland, and she desired to reply
to the imputation in the most public
and emphatic manner. Murray and
Hamilton were summoned to appear,
and in presence of the ambassadors
and her own ministers she asked them
whether she had ever encouraged
them in their rebellion. Murray began
to reply in Scotch, when Elizabeth
stopped him, bidding him speak
in French, which she better understood.
The scene was arranged beforehand.
Murray fell on his knees
and declared "that her majesty had
never moved them to any opposition
or resistance against the queen's marriage."
"Now," exclaimed Elizabeth
in her most triumphant tone,
"you have told the truth; for neither
did I, nor any one in my name, stir
you up against your queen; for your
abominable treason may serve for example
to my own subjects to rebel
against me. Therefore get you out
of my presence; ye are but unworthy
traitors." This astounding exhibition
of meanness, and falsehood, and folly,
which it is certain, says Mr. Hosack,
imposed upon no one who witnessed
it, is without a parallel in history.</p>

<p>Mary's energy and prudence in
suppressing this dangerous rebellion
sufficiently refute a prevalent notion
that she was indebted to the counsels
of Murray for the previous success
of her administration. Even Robertson
admits that at no period of her
career were her abilities and address
more conspicuous. And more remarkable
than her ability in gaining
success was the moderation with which
she used it. Not one of the rebels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
suffered death, and her speedy pardon
of the Duke of Chatelherault, a conspirator
against her crown, of which
he was the presumptive heir, was an
instance of generosity unexampled in
the history of princes.</p>

<p>The accusation against Mary of
having signed the Catholic League,
put forward by so many historians&mdash;Froude,
of course, among them&mdash;is
clearly shown by Mr. Hosack to be
utterly untrue. She never joined it.
By this refusal she maintained her
solemn promises to her Protestant
subjects&mdash;the chief of whom remained
her staunchest friend in the days of
her misfortune. She averted religious
discord from her dominions, and posterity
will applaud the wisdom as well
as the magnitude of the sacrifice
which she made at this momentous
crisis.</p>

<p>Then comes the murder of Riccio,
which is generally attributed to the
jealousy of Darnley and the personal
hatred of the nobles. These motives,
if they ever existed at all, were but
secondary with the conspirators who
contrived Riccio's death.</p>

<p>Their main objects were the restoration
of the rebel lords, the deposition
of the queen, and the elevation
of Darnley to the vacant throne, on
which he would have been their puppet.</p>

<p>Mr. Hosack traces, step by step,
the progress of the conspiracy, and
the bargaining and traffic among the
conspirators for their several rewards.
There was a bond of the conspirators
among themselves, a bond with Darnley,
and one with the rebel leaders
who waited events at Newcastle.
Elizabeth's ministers in Scotland were
taken into their confidence and counsels,
as was also John Knox, while
Elizabeth was advised of and approved
it. Many years ago, a Catholic
convent was burned in Boston&mdash;with
what circumstances of atrocity we
do not now desire to recall. On the
Sunday preceding the outrage, exciting
sermons were delivered on the
horrors of popery from more than
one Protestant pulpit. So, also, on
the Sunday preceding the murder of
Riccio, the denunciations of idolatry
from the pulpits of Edinburgh were
more than usually violent, and the
texts were chosen from those portions
of Scripture which describe the
vengeance incurred by the persecutors
of God's people. The 12th of March
was the day fixed for the parliament
before which the rebel lords were cited
to appear, under pain of the forfeiture
of their titles and estates. This
forfeiture the conspirators were resolved
to prevent, and chose the 9th
of March to kill Riccio. They could
have assassinated him at any time on
the street, in the grounds, in his own
room; but the lords selected the hour
just after supper when Riccio would
be in attendance upon the queen, in
order to kill him in her presence,
doubtless with hope of the result of
her death and that of her unborn
babe from the agitation and affright
that must ensue from such a scene.
<i>The contingency of Mary's death was
provided for in the bond.</i> We need
not here repeat the horrible details of
the scene in which, while a ruffian
(Ker of Faudonside) pressed a cocked
pistol to her breast until she felt the
cold iron through her dress, the hapless
victim of brutal prejudice and bigotry,
whose only crime was fidelity
to his queen, was dragged from her
presence and instantly butchered.
Nor need we describe the fiendish
exultation and savage conduct of the
assassins toward a sick, defenceless
woman.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Machiavelli," remarks Mr. Hosack,
"never conceived&mdash;he has certainly not described&mdash;a
plot more devilish in its designs
than that which was devised ostensibly for
the death of Riccio, but in reality for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
destruction both of Mary Stuart and her
husband."</p></blockquote>

<p>For two days the noble assassins
appeared to have been entirely successful.
Riccio was killed, the parliament
was dissolved, the banished
lords recalled, and the queen a prisoner.
But her amazing spirit and
resolution scattered all their plans to
the winds. The poor fool Darnley
began to see the treachery of the men
who had made him their tool, and
Mary fully opened his eyes to his
danger. At midnight on the Tuesday
after the murder, the queen and Darnley
crept down through a secret passage
to the cemetery of the royal
chapel of Holyrood and made their
way "through the charnel house,
among the bones and skulls of the
ancient kings," to where horses and a
small escort stood waiting for them.
Twenty miles away Mary galloped
to Dunbar, where, within three days,
eight thousand border spears assembled
to defend her.</p>

<p>The assassins, Morton, Ruthven,
and their associates, fled to England,
where, under Elizabeth's wing, they
were of course safe. Maitland went
to the Highlands, and Knox, grieving
deeply over the discomfiture of his
friends, took his departure for the
west.</p>

<p>The complicity of Murray,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The head of many a felon plot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never once the arm,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>was not known, and he was pardoned
his rebellion, and again received
by Mary into her confidence. This
is the Murray constantly referred to
by Mr. Froude in his History of England
as "the noble Murray," "the
stainless Murray"&mdash;a man who, for
systematic, thorough-going villainy
and treachery has not his superior in
history.</p>

<p>Darnley, with an audacity and recklessness
of consequences which seem
hardly compatible with sanity, made
a solemn declaration to the effect
that he was wholly innocent of the
late murderous plot.</p>

<p>The indignation of his associates
in the crime knew no bounds. He
alone, they said, had caused the failure
of the enterprise; he had deserted
them, and now sought to purchase
his safety in their ruin. From that
moment his fate was sealed.</p>

<p>Buchanan's famous lie concerning
Mary's visit to the Castle of Alloa,
which, to his shame, Mr. Froude substantially
repeats, is disposed of effectually
in a few words by Mr. Hosack.</p>

<p>The ride from Jedburg, too, as recounted
by Buchanan in his own peculiar
style, repeated by Robertson
and by Froude, as far as he dares, in
the teeth of the testimony on the
subject, also receives its <i>quietus</i> at
Mr. Hosack's hands.</p>

<p>Then follow the dangerous illness
of Mary, the aggravating and fatal
misconduct of Darnley, the poor
queen's mental suffering and anxiety,
the preliminary plotting by Murray,
Maitland, Argyll, and Huntly to put
Darnley out of the way, the signing
of the bond among them for the murder
of the "young fool and tyrant,"
and the insidious attempt by these
scoundrels to entrap the poor heart-broken
Mary into some such expression
of impatience or violence against
Darnley as would enable them to set
up the charge of guilty knowledge
against her. The conspirators themselves
have put on record the noble
and Christian reply of Mary Stuart,
"I will that ye do nothing through
which any spot may be laid on my
honor or conscience; and therefore,
I pray you, rather let the matter be
in the state that it is, abiding till God
of his goodness put remedy thereto."</p>

<p>Following upon the baptism of the
infant prince, who afterward became
James VI. of Scotland, came the unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
too successful endeavors
of Murray, Maitland, Bothwell, and
Queen Elizabeth to obtain the pardon
of the Riccio murderers.</p>

<p>Poor Mary's political success would
have been assured if she had possessed
but a small share of Elizabeth's
hardness of heart and vindictiveness.
Always generous, always noble, always
forgiving, she allowed herself to
be persuaded to grant a pardon to
these villains&mdash;seventy-six in number&mdash;excepting
only George Douglas,
who stabbed Riccio in presence of
the queen, and Ker of Faudonside,
who held his pistol at her breast during
the perpetration of the murder.
This ruffian remained safely in England
until Mary's downfall, when he
returned to Scotland and married the
widow of John Knox.</p>

<p>It was about this period that Buchanan
was extolling to the skies, in
such Latin verses as those beginning</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Virtute ingenio, regina, et munere formÃ¦<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felicibus felicior majoribus,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>the virtues of a sovereign whom he
afterward told us every one knew at
the time to be a monster of lust and
cruelty! His libel was written when
Mary was a fugitive in England, to
serve the purposes of his employers,
who had driven her from her native
kingdom. The most assiduous of her
flatterers as long as she was on the
throne, he pursued her with the malice
of a demon when she became a
helpless prisoner. His slanders were
addressed not to his own countrymen,
for whom they would have been
too gross, but to Englishmen, for the
great majority of whom Scotland was
a <i>terra incognita</i>. His monstrous fictions
were copied by Knox and De
Thou, and later by Robertson, Laing,
and Mignet, who, while using his material,
carefully abstained from quoting
him as authority. Mr. Froude,
the author of that popular serial novel
which he strangely entitles <cite>The
History of England</cite>, with delicious
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naÃ¯vetÃ©</i> declares his belief in the truth
of Buchanan's <cite>Detection</cite>, and makes
its transparent mendacity a leading
feature of his work.</p>

<p>According to Buchanan, the Queen
of Scots was, at the period above referred
to, leading a life of the most
notorious profligacy. Mr. Hosack, in
his calm, lawyer-like manner, shows
conclusively that at that very time
she never stood higher in the estimation
both of her own subjects and of
her partisans in England. Considering
the difficulties of her position, he
adds, Mary had conducted the government
of Scotland with remarkable
prudence and success; and her
moderation in matters of religion induced
even the most powerful of the
Protestant nobility to regard her
claims with favor.</p>

<p>And still the plotting went on.
Motives enough, for them, had Murray,
Morton, Maitland, and the rest
to seek the destruction of Darnley&mdash;revenge
and greed of gain. These
men had imposed upon the generous
nature of the queen in the disposal
of the crown lands, and they well
knew that Darnley had made no secret
of his disapproval of the improvident
bounty of his wife. These
grants of the crown lands, under the
law of Scotland, could be revoked at
any time before the queen attained
the age of twenty-five. That period
was now at hand, and the danger of
their losing their spoils under the influence
of Darnley was imminent.</p>

<p>He had just been taken down with
the small-pox at Glasgow, and the
conspirators, well knowing Mary's forgiving
temper, feared, as well they
might, that his illness would lead to
a reconciliation between them.</p>

<p>Although Bothwell had shared less
in the bounty of the queen than the
others, his motive was no less powerful
for seeking the death of Darnley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
He aspired to Darnley's place as the
queen's husband, and his ambition
was no secret to Murray and the others.
Full willingly they lent themselves
to aid him, knowing that, if
successful, his plans would be fatal
both to the queen and to himself.</p>

<p>Queen Mary went from Edinburgh
to Glasgow, to visit Darnley on his
sick-bed. On this visit hinges a
mass of accusations against Mary by
her enemies. We regret that the passages
of Mr. Hosack's book in which
he dissects and analyzes all the evidence
covering the period from the
journey to Glasgow down to the explosion
at Kirk-a-field are too long
to be copied here. They are masterly,
and more thoroughly dispose of
the slanders than any statement we
have seen. He moreover demonstrates
that the queen's journey to
Glasgow, heretofore relied on as a
proof of her duplicity because she
went uninvited, was undertaken at
Darnley's own urgent request. It is
during this visit to Glasgow that Mary
is charged with having written the
two casket letters, which, if genuine,
certainly would prove her to be accessory
to the murder of her husband.
With thorough knowledge of Scotch
localities, language, customs, and peculiarities,
and with a perfect mastery
of all the details of testimony, <i>pro</i>
and <i>con</i>, in existence on the subject&mdash;a
mastery which Mr. Froude is far
from possessing&mdash;Mr. Hosack makes
the examination of this question of
the genuineness of the Glasgow letters
with an application of the laws
of evidence that enables him&mdash;if we
may be permitted the homely phrase&mdash;to
turn them inside out. Contrasted
with the sweet, trusting, child-like
confidence with which the letters are
received by Mr. Froude, Mr. Hosack's
treatment of them is shockingly
cool. In commenting upon Hume's
opinion that the style of the second
Glasgow letter was inelegant but "natural,"
Mr. Hosack remarks that human
depravity surely has its limits,
and the most hardened wretches do
not boast, and least of all in writing,
of their treachery and cruelty. Even
in the realm of fiction we find no such
revolting picture.</p>

<p>Of the third letter, the historian
Robertson long since remarked that,
"if Mary's adversaries forged her letters,
they were certainly employed
very idly when they produced this."
And this remark may correctly be
applied to the fourth letter. The
difference between the two first and
the two last is the most striking. The
Glasgow letters breathe only lust and
murder; but these are written, to all
appearance, by a wife to her husband,
in very modest and becoming language.
She gently reproaches him
with his forgetfulness, and with the
coldness of his writings, sends him a
gift in testimony of her unchangeable
affection, and finally describes herself
as his obedient, lawful wife. This is
not the language of a murderess, and
these simple and tender thoughts
were not traced by the same hand
that composed the Glasgow letters.
They are the genuine letters of Mary,
not to Bothwell, but to her husband
Darnley, and they are here by
result of an ingenious device to mix
up a few genuine letters of Mary with
those intended to prove her guilty of
the murder. The only letters of importance
as testimony against the
queen are the two first, and they
were conclusively proven by Goodall,
more than a century ago, to have
been written originally in Scotch.</p>

<p>Concerning Paris, whose testimony
is strongly relied on by Mary's enemies,
Mr. Hosack has made a very
important discovery. According to
a letter of Murray to Queen Elizabeth,
Paris arrived in Leith (a prisoner)
about the middle of June, 1569.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
But Professor Schiern, of Copenhagen,
in compliance with a request made
by Mr. Hosack to search the Danish
archives for any papers relating to
Scotland, found the receipt of Clark,
Murray's agent, acknowledging the
delivery to him of the prisoner Paris
on the 30th of October, 1568. So
that Paris was delivered up nearly a
year before his so-called deposition
was produced. The authenticity of
his deposition, monstrous though it
be, has been stoutly maintained by
several of Mary's enemies. Even
Hume remarks upon it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is in vain at present to seek improbabilities
in Nicolas Hubert's dying confession,
and to magnify the smallest difficulty into a
contradiction. It was certainly a regular
judicial paper, given in regularly and judicially,
and ought to have been canvassed at
the time, if the persons whom it concerned
had been assured of their own innocence."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Hume is an attractive writer,
but as a historian it is long since people
ceased to rely upon him for facts.
The passage here quoted is a characteristic
exemplification of his extraordinary
carelessness. According to
Mr. Hosack, the short sentence cited
contains three distinct and palpable
mistakes. In the first place, the paper
containing the depositions of Paris
was authenticated by no judicial authority.
Secondly, it was not given
in regularly and judicially; for it was
secretly sent to London in October,
1569, many months after the termination
of the Westminster conferences.
Lastly, it was impossible that it
could have been canvassed at the
time by those whom it concerned; for
it was not only kept a profound secret
from the queen and her friends
during her life, but it was not made
public for nearly a century and a half
after her death. The depositions of
Paris were first given to the world in
the collections of Anderson in 1725.</p>

<p>It did not at all suit Murray's purpose
to produce Paris in open court.
So, after being tortured, he was executed,
and in place of a witness who
might have told what he saw and
heard, was produced a so-called deposition
professedly written by a servant
of Murray, and attested by two
of his creatures, Buchanan and Wood,
both pensioners of Cecil, and both
enemies of the Queen of Scotland.
Buchanan, of course, had full cognizance
of the Paris deposition, for he
subscribed it as a witness; and yet we
have the singular fact that, although
he appended to his <cite>Detectio</cite> the depositions
of Hay, Hepburn, and Dalgleish,
that of Paris is omitted. Again,
in his <cite>History of Scotland</cite>, published
subsequently, although he refers to
Paris in several passages, he is still
silent as to his deposition. The solution
of this seeming singularity is
simple. He rejected it for its manifest
extravagance and absurdity, which,
he wisely concluded, could not impose
on the worst enemies of the queen.</p>

<p>Fable and fiction answering Mr.
Froude's purpose just as well as authentic
history, he of course accepts
the "Paris" paper as perfectly true. A
successful writer of the romance of
history, Mr. Froude deserves great
credit for his industry in gathering
every variety of material for his novel
without any absurd sentimental
squeamishness as to its origin.</p>

<p>And now, little by little, the truth
begins to come out. For full two
years after the murder of Darnley,
no one was publicly charged with the
crime but Bothwell and the queen.
And this because it was the interest
of the ruling faction in Scotland,
(themselves the murderers,) to confine
the accusation to these two persons.
But as in time events develop, we
find the leaders of this faction, quarrelling
among themselves, begin to
accuse each other of the crime, until
the principal nobility of Scotland are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
implicated in it. Mr. Hosack's conclusion,
from a searching analysis of
all the evidence on record, is, that the
mysterious assassination of Darnley
was not a domestic but a political
crime; and it was one which for
many a day secured political power
to that faction which from the first
had opposed his marriage, and had
never ceased from the time of his arrival
in Scotland to lay plots for his
destruction.</p>

<p>As might be expected, Mary's enemies
accuse her of a criminal degree
of inactivity after the death of her
husband. But what could she do?
Who were the murderers? No one
could tell. The whole affair was then
involved in impenetrable mystery.
Her chief officers of justice, Huntly
the chancellor, and Argyll the lord-justice,
were both in the plot; Bothwell,
the sheriff of the county, on
whom should devolve the pursuit and
arrest of the criminal, had taken an
active share in the perpetration of
the murder, and Maitland, the secretary,
who had first proposed to get
rid of Darnley, was probably the
most guilty of all. In a memorial
afterward addressed by Mary to the
different European courts, she thus
describes the situation: "Her majesty
could not but marvel at the little
diligence they used, and that they
looked at one another as men who
wist not what they say or do."</p>

<p>And now calumny ran riot. Slanderous
tongues and pens were busy.
Since Mary had dismissed the insolent
Randolph from her court, Elizabeth
had maintained no ambassador
there, so that the usual official <i>espionage</i>
could not be carried on. Instead
thereof, Sir William Drury, stationed
on the Scotch border, transmitted day
by day a current of scandalous stories.
Mary was a woman, and her
enemies might effect by slander what
they could not accomplish by force.
Then, too, a bigoted religious prejudice
made the work easy. No matter,
says our author, what was the
nature of the accusation against a
Catholic queen; so long as it was
boldly made and frequently repeated,
it was sure to gain a certain amount
of credit in the end. Here follows,
in Mr. Hosack's pages, an able presentation
of contemporary testimony
going to show the falsehood of the
accusations that the queen was at
this time on a footing of intimate
understanding with Bothwell. Under
the circumstances his trial was, of
course, a farce.</p>

<p>The most powerful men in Scotland
were his associates in guilt. One
of his noble accomplices in the murder
rode by his side to the Talbooth.
Another accomplice, the Earl of Argyll,
hereditary lord-justice, presided
at the trial; and the Earl of Caithness,
a near connection of Bothwell
by marriage, was foreman of the jury.
The parliament which met soon after
did little, besides passing the Act of
Toleration, but enact statutes confirming
Maitland, Huntly, Morton,
and Murray in their titles and estates.
As we have seen, this was
precisely the main object sought by
these men in the murder of Darnley,
an object passed over in silence by
most historians, and not understood
by others. Their common interest in
his death was the strongest bond of
union among the noble assassins. If
Darnley had lived, he would have
prevented the confirmation of these
grants; for he had made significant
threats on that subject, especially as
to the gifts to Murray. Murray and
the others wanted the lands and titles.
They obtained them. Bothwell had
his own designs, and these were insolent
in their ambition. He wanted
the queen's hand in marriage as a
step to the throne. It was but just
that his companions should help him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
as he had aided them. On the evening
of the day on which parliament
rose, (April 19th,) Both well gave an
entertainment at a tavern in Edinburgh
to a large party of the nobility.
After wine had circulated freely, he
laid before his guests a bond for their
signatures. This document recited
that it was prejudicial to the realm
that the queen should remain a widow;
and it recommended him, (Bothwell,)
a married man, as the fittest
husband she could obtain among her
subjects. With a solitary exception&mdash;the
Earl of Eglinton&mdash;all the lords
present signed this infamous bond,
and thereby bound themselves to
"further advance and set forward the
said marriage," and to risk their lives
and goods against all who should
seek to hinder or oppose it. It is
claimed by Mr. Froude that his special
saint, "the noble and stainless
Murray," did not sign this bond; but
it is now made plain that he did.
Meantime calumny had free scope,
and no invention was too gross for
belief by many, if it but carried with
it some injury to Mary's reputation.
Thus, she is accused of journeying
to Stirling for the express purpose of
poisoning her infant son. Poor Marie
Antoinette in after years, as we know,
was accused of something worse than
taking the life of her child. The answer
of these two Catholic queens,
great in their sufferings, and grand in
their resignation, was, in each case,
an eloquent burst of nature and
queenly dignity. "The natural love,"
said Mary Stuart, "which the mother
bears to her only bairn is sufficient to
confound them, and needs no other
answer." She afterward added, that
all the world knew that the very men
who now charged her with this atrocious
crime had wronged her son
even before his birth; for they would
have slain him in her womb, although
they now pretended in his name to
exercise their usurped authority.</p>

<p>On the 23d of April, while travelling
from Linlithgow to Edinburgh,
with a few attendants, the queen was
stopped by Bothwell, at the head of
one thousand horse. Bothwell rode
up, caught her bridle-rein, and assured
her that "she was in the greatest
possible danger," and forthwith
escorted her to one of her own castles,
Dunbar. Here she was kept a
prisoner. Melville, who accompanied
her, was sent away, having heard
Bothwell boast that he would marry
the queen, even "whether she would
herself or not." No woman was allowed
near her but Bothwell's sister.</p>

<p>Although our readers are familiar
with the horrible story, the best account
of it is, after all, Mary's own
simple and modest narrative of the
abominable outrage. It is found in
Keith, vol. ii. p. 599, and in Hosack,
p. 313. After referring to the great
services and unshaken loyalty of
Bothwell, she says that, previous to
her visit to Stirling, he had made certain
advances, "to which her answer
was in no degree correspondent to
his desire;" but that, having previously
obtained the consent of the nobility
to the marriage, he did not hesitate
to carry her off to the castle of Dunbar;
that when she reproached him
for his audacity, he implored her to
attribute his conduct to the ardor of
his affection, and to condescend to
accept him as her husband, in accordance
with the wishes of his brother
nobles; that he then, to her amazement,
laid before her the bond of the
nobility, declaring that it was essential
to the peace and welfare of the
kingdom that she should choose another
husband, and that, of all her
subjects, Bothwell was best deserving
of that honor; that she still, notwithstanding,
refused to listen to his proposals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
believing that, as on her former
visit to Dunbar, an army of loyal subjects
would speedily appear for her
deliverance; but that, as day after
day passed without a sword being
drawn in her defence, she was forced
to conclude that the bond was genuine,
and that her chief nobility were
all in league with Bothwell; and
finally, that, finding her a helpless
captive, he assumed a bolder tone,
and "so ceased he never till, by persuasion
and importunate suit, <i>accompanied
not the less by force</i>, he has
finally driven us to end the work
begun." Forced to marry Bothwell
Mary was, to all who saw her, an
utterly wretched woman, and longed
only for death. The testimony on
this point is very ample, and her
behavior at this crisis of her history,
concludes Mr. Hosack, can only be
explained by her rooted aversion to a
marriage which was forced upon her
by the daring ambition of Bothwell
and the matchless perfidy of his brother
nobles.</p>

<p>But already a fresh plot was on
foot. Melville wrote to Cecil concerning
it, on the 7th of May; and
on the following day, Kirkaldy of
Grange sent to the Earl of Bedford
a letter intended for Elizabeth's eye.
Kirkaldy, the Laird of Grange, an
ardent Protestant, who, at the age of
nineteen, was one of the men who
murdered Cardinal Beaton, enjoyed
among his fellow-nobles the reputation
of being a man of honor, and
the best and bravest soldier in Scotland.
He advised Bedford of the
signing of a "bond" by "the most
part of the nobility," one head of
which was, "to seek the liberty of
the queen, who is ravished and detained
by the Earl of Bothwell;"
another, "to pursue them that murdered
the king." The letter concludes
by asking Elizabeth's aid and
support for "suppressing of the cruel
murtherer Bothwell." But Elizabeth
had lost not only much money, but
all credit for veracity, by her last
interference in Scottish affairs, and
refused to have any thing to do with
this plot.</p>

<p>For three weeks after her marriage
the queen remained at Holyrood; the
prisoner, to all appearance, rather
than the wife of Bothwell. She was
continually surrounded with guards;
and the description of her situation
given by Melville, who was at court
at the time, agrees entirely with that
of the French ambassador. Not a
day passed, he says, in which she did
not shed tears; and he adds that
many, even of Bothwell's followers,
"believed that her majesty would
fain have been quit of him." The
insurgent leaders&mdash;Morton, Maitland,
and Hume&mdash;were busy, and soon in
the field with their forces. Bothwell
raised a small levy to oppose them,
and the two armies met at Carberry
Hill on the 15th of June, 1567, exactly
one month after the marriage.
There was no fighting. Dangerous
as it was, Mary preferred to trust herself
to the rebel lords than to remain
with Bothwell. She received their
pledge&mdash;that, in case she would separate
herself from Bothwell, they were
ready "to serve her upon their knees,
as her most humble and obedient
subjects and servants"&mdash;through Kirkaldy
of Grange, the only man among
them whose word she would take.
They kept their pledge as they usually
observed such obligations. What
followed is too horrible to dwell upon.
It is wonderful that any human being
could have lived through the physical
exhaustion, the insults, and the brutal
treatment this poor woman was subjected
to during the next two days.
The people of Edinburgh grew indignant;
and Kirkaldy of Grange swore
the lords should not violate their promises.
But they quieted him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
showing a forged letter of the queen
to Bothwell. It was not the first
time some among them had forged
Mary's signature. With every circumstance
of force and brutality,
Mary was then imprisoned in Lochleven,
whose guardian was the mother
of the bastard Murray.</p>

<p>And now, while the friends of Mary,
numerous as they were, remained irresolute
and inactive, the dominant
faction made the most strenuous
efforts to strengthen itself. In the
towns, where its strength chiefly lay,
and especially in Edinburgh, says
Mr. Hosack, the Protestant preachers
rendered the most valuable aid.
By indulging in furious invectives
against the queen, and charging her
directly with the murder, they prepared
their hearers for the prospect
of her speedy deposition, and the
<i>establishment of a regency in the name
of the infant prince</i>. It is clear that
Murray was not forgotten by his
friends the preachers.</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, there can
be but little doubt that Elizabeth was
sincerely indignant on hearing of the
outrageous treatment of Mary by the
lords. In her whole history, she never
appeared to so much advantage
as a woman and a queen. She
would not stand tamely by, she said,
and see her cousin murdered; and if
remonstrances proved ineffectual, she
would send an army to chastise and
reduce them to obedience. Such
conduct, and her messages to Mary
while a prisoner at Lochleven, no
doubt inspired the Scottish queen
with the fatal confidence which induced
her, a few months afterward,
to seek refuge in England. Unfortunately
for Elizabeth, and perhaps
more unfortunately for Mary, the
Queen of England's reputation for
duplicity was now so well established
that no one but her own ministers
believed she was now sincere. Maitland,
for the Scotch nobles, plainly
told Elizabeth's ambassador that, after
what had occurred in times past,
"they could place no reliance on his
mistress;" and the King of France
said to Sir Henry Norris, "I do not
greatly trust her." Meantime, the
ministers daily denounced Mary as a
murderess in their sermons, and demanded
that she should be brought
to justice like an ordinary criminal.
Elizabeth's ambassador tried to induce
the confederate lords to restrain
the savage license of the preachers;
but we cannot doubt, says Mr. Hosack,
that they were secretly encouraged
by their noble patrons to prepare
the minds of the people for the
deposition, if not for the murder, of
the queen. Throgmorton's opinion
was that, but for his presence in Scotland,
she would have been sacrificed
to the ambition and the bigotry of
her subjects.</p>

<p>Still a prisoner at Lochleven, Mary
had to suffer the brutality of the ruffian
Lindsay, and the infamous hypocrisy
of Mr. Froude's "stainless Murray,"
who, with money in both pockets
from France and England, now came,
with characteristic deceit, to defraud
his sister of her crown. Mr. Hosack
thus estimates his performance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"First, to terrify his sister with the prospect
of immediate death, then to soothe her
with false promises of safety, and finally,
with well-feigned reluctance, to accept the
dignity he was longing to grasp, displayed a
mixture of brutality and cunning of which
he alone was capable."</p></blockquote>

<p>Murray was proclaimed regent on
the 22d of August. Soon afterward
began the machinations for accusing
Mary of Darnley's murder; and Murray's
first care was to put out of the
way every witness whose testimony
could be of any importance. Hay,
Hepburn, and Powrie and Dalgleish,
on whom the queen's letters were
said to have been found, were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
tried, convicted, and executed on the
same day. It was remarked that the
proceedings were conducted with extraordinary
and indecent haste. Hay
and Hepburn, from the scaffold, denounced
the nobles who had "made
a bond for the king's murder." Public
confidence was shaken in the regent,
and the discontent of the people
was expressed in plain speech and satirical
ballads. Murray began to feel
the need of Elizabeth's assistance.
Mary, in her trusting confidence, had
voluntarily placed all her valuable
jewels in Murray's hands, for safe
keeping. From among them he selected
a set of rare pearls, the most
valuable in Europe, which he sent by
an agent to Elizabeth, who agreed to
purchase what she well knew he had
no right to sell. Under such circumstances,
as is the custom among
thieves and receivers, she expected a
bargain, and got it. It was a very
pretty transaction. In May, 1568,
Mary escaped from Lochleven castle,
and in a few days found herself at
the head of an army of six thousand
men. Of the ten earls and lords who
flew to her support, nine were Protestants;
and our Puritan historian
finds it remarkable that, in spite of
all the efforts of Murray and his faction,
and in spite of all the violence
of the preachers, she&mdash;the Catholic
Queen of Scotland, the daughter of
the hated house of Guise, the reputed
mortal enemy of their religion&mdash;should
now, after being maligned as the most
abandoned of her sex, find her best
friends among her own Protestant
subjects, appears at first sight inexplicable.
A phenomenon so strange,
he adds, admits of only one explanation.
If, throughout her reign, she
had not loyally kept her promises
of security and toleration to her Protestant
subjects, they assuredly would
not, in her hour of need, have risked
their lives and fortunes in her defence.</p>

<p>Against her better judgment, Mary
was induced to fight the battle of
Langside, and lost the field. And
now the queen made the great mistake
of her life. Instead of trusting
to the loyalty of the Scotch borderers,
she determined to throw herself on
the hospitality of the Queen of England.
In vain did her trusty counsellors
and strongest supporters seek
to dissuade her. The warm professions
of friendship and attachment
made to her by Elizabeth, when she
was a prisoner at Lochleven, had
completely captivated her; and, insisting
on her project, she crossed the
Solway, in an open boat, to the English
shore. She was received by Mr.
Lowther, deputy warden, with all the
respect due to her rank and misfortunes.
Although she did not yet
know it, Mary was from this moment
a prisoner. Here Mr. Hosack, in a
few eloquent passages, sets forth the
reasons why the forcible detention of
Mary, independently of all considerations
of morality and justice, was a
political blunder of the first magnitude.
As the inmate of an English
prison, she proved a far more formidable
enemy to Elizabeth than when
she wore the crowns both of France
and Scotland. Never did a political
crime entail a heavier measure of retribution
than the captivity and murder
of the Queen of Scots entailed
on England.</p>

<p>Mary was first taken to the castle
of Carlisle. Here Queen Elizabeth
was represented by Lord Scrope, the
warden of the marches, and Sir
Francis Knollys, the queen's vice-chamberlain.
These noblemen appear
to have been more impressed
with the mental and moral qualities
of the Scottish queen than with her
external graces. They describe her,
after their first interview, as possessing
"an eloquent tongue and a discreet
head, with stout courage and a liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
heart;" and, in a subsequent letter,
Knollys says, "Surely, she is a rare
woman; for as no flattery can abuse
her, so no plain speech seems to offend
her, if she thinks the speaker an honest
man." All this was written to
Elizabeth, to whom, of course, it was
gall and wormwood. A more remarkable
passage of their letter is
that in which, speaking in simple candor
as English gentlemen and men
of honor, they ask their royal mistress
whether</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"it were not honorable for you, in the sight
of your own subjects and of all foreign
princes, to put her grace to the choice,
whether she will depart freely back into her
country without your highness's impeachment,
or whether she will remain at your
highness's devotion within your realm here,
with her necessary servants only to attend
her?"</p></blockquote>

<p>To a sovereign whose policy was
synonymous with fraud, the unconscious
sarcasm of this honorable advice
must have been biting.</p>

<p>Elizabeth pledged her word to
Mary that she should be restored to
her throne. She at the same time
pledged her word to Murray that
Mary should never be permitted to
return to Scotland. Then began the
long nineteen years' martyrdom of
Mary. The conference at York and
the commission at Westminster were
mockeries of justice. It was pretended
there were two parties present
before them&mdash;Murray and his associates
on one side, Mary on the other.
Mary was kept a prisoner in a distant
castle, while Murray, received with
honor at court, held private and secret
consultations with members of
both these quasi-judicial bodies, showed
them the testimony he intended to
produce, and obtained their judgment
as to the sufficiency of his proofs before
he publicly produced them; these
proofs being the forged letters of the
silver casket. These letters were never
seen by Mary Stuart, and even
copies of them were repeatedly and
persistently refused her. Mr. Froude
makes a lame attempt to show that
<em>some one</em> secretly furnished her copies;
but even if his attempt were successful,
it does not affect the fact that the
copies were officially refused her. By
the time the scales had fallen from
Mary's eyes, Elizabeth's art and duplicity
had woven a web from which
she could not be extricated. Her
remaining years of life were one
long, heart-sickening struggle against
treachery, spies, insult to her person,
her reputation, and her faith; confinement,
cold, sickness, neuralgic agony,
want; deprivation of all luxuries, of
medical attendance, and of the consolations
of religion. At every fresh
spasm of alarm on the part of Elizabeth,
Mary's prison was changed;
frequently in dead of winter, and
generally without any provision for
the commonest conveniences of life.
More than once, taken into a naked,
cold castle, Mary's jailers had to rely
on the charity of the neighbors for
even a bed for their royal prisoner.
At Tutbury, her rooms were so dark
and comfortless, and the surroundings
so filthy&mdash;there is no other word for
it&mdash;that the English physician refused
to charge himself with her health.
But enough. We all know the sad
story, and we trustingly believe the
poor martyred queen has her recompense
in heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Hosack's treatment of the question
of the authenticity of the silver-casket
letters is exhaustive. More
than a century ago, Goodall fully
exposed the forgery, and he has never
been satisfactorily answered. Mr.
Froude, of course, accepts them without
discussion. The conferences at
York and the proceedings at Westminster
are presented as only a lawyer
can present them. Mary's cause
gains by the most rigid scrutiny. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Froude does not know enough to
analyze and intelligibly present serious
matters like these. He prefers
a series of sensational <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tableaux</i> and
highly-colored dissolving views, producing
for authorities garbled citations
and his own fictions. Mr. Hosack's
testimony, independently of its
great intrinsic merit, is valuable because
of his nationality and of his
religion, and we hope to see his work
republished in the United States. His
closing page concludes thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the darkest hours of her existence&mdash;even
when she hailed the prospect of a scaffold
as a blessed relief from her protracted
sufferings&mdash;she never once expressed a doubt
as to the verdict that would be finally pronounced
between her and her enemies.
'The theatre of the world,' she calmly reminded
her judges at Fotheringay, 'is wider
than the realm of England.' She appealed
from the tyranny of her persecutors to the
whole human race; and she has not appealed
in vain. The history of no woman that ever
lived approaches in interest to that of Mary
Stuart; and so long as beauty and intellect,
a kindly spirit in prosperity, and matchless
heroism in misfortune attract the sympathies
of men, this illustrious victim of sectarian
violence and barbarous statecraft will ever
occupy the most prominent place in the
annals of her sex."</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE BRIGAND'S GOD-CHILD.<br />

<small>A LEGEND OF SPAIN.</small></h2>



<p>Once upon a time, as the legends
say, there lived in good old Spain a
poor workman, to whom destiny had
given twelve children, and nothing for
them to live upon. Now his wife
was expecting a thirteenth, and perhaps
with it would appear a fourteenth also,
to run about loved but unclothed
and unfed, as the others had before
them. The bread was almost gone,
work not to be had, and the poor man,
to hide his sighs and his misery from
the patient partner of his misfortunes,
wandered far from home and into the
woods, calling upon paradise to assist
him, until he came to the ill-reputed
cavern and stronghold of the bandits.</p>

<p>He almost fell over their captain,
and came very near receiving a sabre-thrust
for his pains; but his extreme
misery made him no object for a
robbery, so he was simply catechised
as to his condition.</p>

<p>He told his story, moved even the
brigand heart to pity, and was invited
to supper; a bag of gold and a fine
horse were given him, and he was sent
home with the assurance that, be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
new-comer boy or girl, the robber-chief
would stand as god-father. The poor
man, in ecstasy at such good fortune,
flew rather than rode to his well-filled
dwelling, and arrived there just in time
to welcome number thirteen.</p>

<p>A boy! He gave his wife the money
and a caress, and, although the
night was far advanced, mounted his
charger and galloped back to the
cave. The brigand was astonished
at his speedy return; but true to
his word, appeared with him in the
neighboring church in disguise of a
rich old gossip, made every requisite
promise for the new-born babe, and
disappeared, leaving a bag of golden
crowns and another purse of
gold.</p>

<p>The angels, however, claimed the
baby, and the brigand's god-child flew
to paradise on golden wings, and in
the splendid swaddling-clothes that
his charity had provided for it.</p>

<p>St. Peter, porter at the gates celestial,
stirred himself to welcome the little
fellow to heaven; but no! he
would not enter unless accompanied
by his god-father.</p>

<p>"And who may he be?" asked St.
Peter.</p>

<p>"Who?" responded the god-child;
"The chief of the brigands."</p>

<p>"My poor little innocent," said the
saint, "you know not what you ask!
Come in yourself; but heaven was not
made for such as he."</p>

<p>The child sat down by the door resolved
not to enter, and planning in
his little head all sorts of schemes
to accomplish his purpose, when the
Blessed Mary passed that way.</p>

<p>"Why do you not enter, my angel?"
she said.</p>

<p>"I would be ungrateful," he answered,
"to partake of heavenly joys if my
good god-father did not share them
with me."</p>

<p>St. Peter interposed, and appealed
to the Holy Mother, saying,</p>

<p>"If he had only been a wax-carrier!
but this man, Satan's own emissary&mdash;impossible!
An incarnate demon; a
robber, healthy and robust, who has
taken every opportunity to do mischief!
Holy Mother! could such a
thing be thought of?"</p>

<p>But the god-child insisted, bent his
pretty blonde head, joined his little
hands, fell on his knees, prayed and
wept. The Virgin had compassion on
him and bringing a golden chalice
from the heavenly inclosure, said,</p>

<p>"Take this; go and seek your god-father;
tell him that he may come
with you to heaven; but he must first
fill this cup with repentant tears."</p>

<p>Just then, by the clear moonlight, reposing
on a rock, and fully armed, lay
the brigand. In his dream his dagger
trembled in his hands. As he awoke,
he saw near his couch a beautiful
winged infant. With no fear of the
savage man, it approached and presented
the golden chalice. He rubbed
his eyes, and thought he still dreamed;
but the infant angel reassured him, saying,</p>

<p>"No; it is not a fancy. I have
come to invite thee to go with me.
Leave this earth. I am thy god-child,
and I will conduct thy steps."</p>

<p>Then the little fellow related his
marvellous story: his arrival at heaven's
gate, St. Peter's refusal, and
how the Blessed Mother, ever merciful,
had come to his assistance and
granted his request. The bandit listened,
and breathed with difficulty,
while, bewildered he gazed on the angelic
figure, and held out his hand
for the golden chalice.</p>

<p>Suddenly his heart seemed to burst,
two fountains of tears gushed from his
eyes. The cup was filled, and the
radiant infant mounted with him to
the skies.</p>

<p>Into heaven the little one entered,
carrying the well-filled cup to St. Peter&mdash;who
was astonished to see who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
followed him&mdash;and proceeded to offer
it at the feet of the beautiful Queen.</p>

<p>She smiled on the sinner who
through her compassion had been
saved, while he threw himself in reverence
at her feet. God himself had
acquitted the debt of the child. Besides,
we know that to the repentant
there is always grace&mdash;and the infant
had declared it would not enter
alone.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>MOLECULAR MECHANICS.</h2>


<p>Among the theories proposed to
explain the constitution of material
substance, and to account for the
facts relative to it disclosed by modern
science, one developed in a recent
work with the above title, by
Rev. Joseph Bayma, of Stonyhurst,
is specially worthy of notice for its
ingenuity and the field which it opens
to the mathematician. Whether it be
true or not, it is at any rate such
that its truth can be tested; and
though this may be somewhat difficult,
on account of the complexity of
the necessary formulas and calculations,
still the difficulty can probably
be overcome in course of time, should
the undertaking seem promising
enough.</p>

<p>It is briefly as follows. Matter is
not continuous, even in very small
parts of its volume, but is composed
of a definite number of ultimate elements,
each of which occupies a mere
point, and may be considered simply
as a centre of force. This force is
actually exerted by each of them following
the law of gravitation as to
its change of intensity with the distance;
but is attractive for some elements
and repulsive for others, which
is obviously necessary to preserve
equilibrium. These elements are arranged
in regularly formed groups, in
which the balance of the attractive
and repulsive forces is such that each
group, as well as the whole mass, is
preserved from collapse or indefinite
expansion; these are what are known
chemically as molecules; and in the
simple substances they probably have
the shape of one of the five regular
polyhedrons.</p>

<p>The simplest possible construction
of a molecule would be one of the
polyhedrons, with an element at each
vertex, and one at the centre, whose
action must be of an opposite character
to that of those at the vertices;
for these last must all exert the same
kind of action, attractive or repulsive,
for any kind of equilibrium to be
maintained, and the centre must act in
the opposite direction to prevent collapse
or expansion of the mass. Furthermore,
the absolute attractive power,
or that which the molecule would
have if all collected at one point,
must exceed the repulsive, slightly at
any rate, since the force exerted at
distances compared with which its
dimensions are insignificant is known
to have this former character.</p>

<p>This system admits of two varieties,
according as the centre is attractive
or repulsive. In either case, for
the maintenance of equilibrium the
force of the centre must always be
less than half that of the vertices
combined, as the author shows, (giving
the values for each polyhedron;)
and it would seem that the first supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
would therefore be untenable,
since the attractive force in each
molecule, as just stated, necessarily
exceeds the repulsive. Equilibrium
certainly cannot be maintained in this
case; but this will not involve the
permanent collapse of the molecule,
but merely a continual vibration of
its elements back and forward through
the centre.</p>

<p>The second hypothesis, on the other
hand, requires either a centre so
weak as to produce very little repulsion
outside of the molecule, or else
a continual tendency to expand under
a central power too great for
equilibrium. Both will tend to bring
the molecular envelopes near to each
other, and produce adhesion or mixing
among them; also, it may perhaps
be added, that the envelopes
themselves will, on account of the
mutual attraction of their elements,
be unstable.</p>

<p>Of these two constructions, then,
the first would seem most probable;
but both are open to objection on
account of there being no internal
resistance in the individual molecules
to a change of diameter proportional
to a change produced by external
action in that of a mass of them;
and if such a change should take
place, the mass would be in just the
same statical conditions as before,
only differing in the relative dimensions
of its parts, and the resistance
to pressure which is exhibited more
or less by all matter would not be
accounted for. But it does not seem
quite certain that pressure or traction
of the mass would operate upon the
separate molecules in the same sense.</p>

<p>We are not, however, restricted to
such a simple structure; for there may
be several envelopes instead of only
one, and of these some may be attractive
and others repulsive; the centre
also may be repulsive. There
would have to be an absolute predominance
of attractivity, of course, as
in the previous more simple supposition.
It seems probable that in this
supposition the envelopes would be
all tetrahedric, or that either the cube
and octahedron, or the other two,
which are similarly counterparts of
each other, would alternate. Many
of these forms are examined mathematically
by the author, as to their
internal action.</p>

<p>The exact discussion of their external
action, however, would be exceedingly
intricate, and would not be
worth undertaking without a more
definite idea than we yet have of the
actual shapes presented by the molecules
of the various known substances.
The forms of crystallization
may throw some light upon this, and
they seem to indicate, as the author
acknowledges, that the elements are
not always grouped in regular polyhedrons;
if they are not, they must have
unequal powers, and this may be
sometimes the case. But irregular
crystalline forms are not impossible,
or even improbable, with regular molecules.
He also suggests and applies
a method for obtaining the forms of
the simple chemical substances by
considering what combinations with
others each polyhedron is capable of,
and comparing these results with the
actual combinations into which these
various substances are known to enter,
and deduces the shapes, with
some plausibility, of the molecules of
oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen,
phosphorus, chlorine, sulphur, arsenic,
and iodine. Whether we shall ever
be able to obtain more positive proof
of these interesting conclusions remains
to be seen; but if any molecules
have really the number of envelopes
that would be indicated by
their chemical equivalents, the perfect
determination of their exact mechanical
conditions of combination, and
even of their separate construction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
will probably, as F. Bayma remarks,
be a problem always above the power
of the human mind. If mathematicians
are at all inclined to plume
themselves on having unravelled the
complications of the solar system,
they can find sufficient matter for humiliation
in not being able to understand
the status of a material particle
less than the hundred millionth of an
inch in diameter; for to this extent
subdivision has actually been carried.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable points
in this theory is that part of it which
relates to the ethereal medium which
seems to pervade all space, if the undulatory
theory of light is true, as is
now perhaps universally believed. Instead
of assuming it to be extremely
rare, as is usually done without hesitation,
the author regards it as excessively
dense; "immensely denser than
atmospheric air," to use his own
words. Of course this seems absurd
at first sight, as such a medium apparently
would exert an immense resistance
to the movements of the
heavenly bodies, and in fact to all
movements on their surfaces or elsewhere.
This would certainly be the
case if it were similar to ordinary
matter; and to avoid this difficulty, it
is assumed to be entirely attractive.
The reason for supposing a great density
for this substance is its immense
elasticity and power of transmitting
vibrations; which seems incompatible
with great distances between its
particles, unless these particles are
extremely energetic in their action,
which comes to the same thing; and
this argument has considerable force.</p>

<p>But it does not seem evident that
an attractive medium would not also
interfere with the passage of bodies
through it, though not in the same
way as a repulsive one; and the oscillation
through its centre necessary
for its preservation complicates the
theory somewhat. Also, any marked
accumulation of a powerfully acting
medium round the various celestial
bodies would cause, if varied in any
way by their changes of relative position,
perturbations in their movements.
The very fact, however, that
its own action was so energetic might
make the disturbance in its arrangement
produced by other masses small,
especially if it penetrates those masses,
as is probably generally maintained.
The subject is, of course, one of
great difficulty, and objections readily
suggest themselves to any hypothesis
regarding it; still, it would appear
that on some accounts it might be
better, instead of assuming the medium
to be wholly or predominantly attractive
or repulsive, to suppose it to
have the two forces equally balanced
in its constitution; and if it be, like
other matter, grouped in molecules,
the balance would naturally exist in
each molecule, making it inert at any
but very small distances, and exerting
at these very small distances a
force the character of which would
vary according to the direction.</p>

<p>We have said that the discussion of
the exterior action of the molecules&mdash;that
is, of their action on each other,
or on exterior points in general&mdash;would
be exceedingly complicated.
The only way in which it seems practicable
is that in which the mutual
actions of the planets have been investigated,
namely, a development
of the force in the form of a series;
but this cannot be done advantageously
unless the distances between
the molecules are considerably greater
than the molecular diameters. If,
however, we make the development
of the ratio of the attraction (or repulsion)
exerted by the vertices of a
regular polyhedron in the direction of
its centre, to what it would exert if
concentrated at that centre, in a series
of the powers of the ratio of the
molecular radius to the distance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the point acted on from the centre, it
will be found that the coefficients of
the first and second powers vanish in
all cases; and that in all, except that
of the tetrahedron, those of all the odd
powers also disappear, as well as that
of the fourth in the dodecahedron and
icosahedron. If, then, the absolute
attractive or repulsive power of any
envelope is very nearly compensated
by that of an opposite character prevailing
in the rest of the molecule,
(as seems probable,) the whole series
can be reduced, at any distance which
is very great compared with the molecular
diameter, to two terms&mdash;one a
constant with a very small value, and
the other containing the third, fourth,
or sixth power of the small quantity
which the ratio of the diameter to
the distance has now become. This
should have a negative multiplier, in
order that the force should become
zero; and this it will have for a considerable
distance around the vertices
of all the polyhedrons, the negative
value always covering as much as
two fifths of the spherical surface
about the centre of the molecule, and
compensating even in this case for its
less extent by a greater intensity, as
the mean of this coefficient over the
whole surface is always exactly zero.
Within this distance of no action, for
some space about the centre of the
prevailing polyhedric face, attraction
would prevail till the higher powers
became sensible, and even (as it would
seem) quite up to the centre in the
case of a single envelope, the repulsive
action of which, when combined
with the slight force of the centre,
would apparently be limited to quasi-ellipsoidal
spaces extending out from
each vertex, and having a longer axis
equal to this outer distance of no action.
But this limitation of the repulsive
action will be still greater if
the excess of the absolute attractive
power in the molecule is more considerable,
as long as the distribution
of the force in the different envelopes
remains unaltered; and though the
molecules can approach within tolerably
short distances of each other in
certain directions, this is not objectionable,
since such an approach may
even be required for chemical union
and cohesion. Introsusception would
hardly be probable, unless they were
very different in size. The compound
molecule once formed, whether its
components were of the same or of
different substance, might exercise a
repulsive force at a considerable distance
in all or nearly all directions;
nevertheless, it might still admit of
further increase or of disruption by
an agitation among the molecules,
due to heat, light, or electricity. Of
course, even on this theory, for the
maintenance of physical equilibrium
the mean distance of the molecules
would have to be considerably less
than that of no action, in order that
a repulsion should be produced to
balance the attraction of those beyond
this distance. Still, if the excess of
attractive force in each molecule, and
consequently the size of each, be
made small enough, their dimensions
may still be small compared even
with this mean distance; so that in
no case, except that of chemical
union, would it be necessary to take
account of the higher powers. Any
motion communicated from one molecule
to another would then probably
be by means of an actual relative
movement of the centres of gravity,
instead of by internal vibrations.</p>

<p>It may be worth noticing that a
regular polyhedron&mdash;the elements of
which exert a force not varying at all
with the distance, and in which the
absolute energy of the centre is precisely
equal to that of the vertices
combined&mdash;gives a resulting force following
the law of gravitation, at any
distance compared with which its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
dimensions can be neglected; and
within this distance the force will
change its sign under the same conditions
of direction as specified in
the previous case. But, as the intensity
of this force will change with
the size of the molecule, it does not
appear that a system of this kind
would be admissible, since, besides
the periodical change due to its own
internal vibration, it would probably
be changed in size, or even in shape,
which would be worse, by compression
or expansion of the mass; which
would be the more likely, as the molecules
could approach much nearer
than in the former supposition. The
law followed by gravitation also seems
to be almost or quite necessary for
forces radiating from a point.</p>

<p>The author's theory seems, on the
whole, extremely plausible. That
each element of matter exerts a force
following the law of gravitation, is
almost demonstrable <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ã  priori</i>; that
the elements are mere points, will also
generally be admitted; that some of
the actions should be repulsive, is
obviously necessary; that each molecule
is composed of a definite number
of atoms, is suggested by chemical
laws; and the polyhedric forms seem
certainly the most reasonable, though
crystalline forms would indicate that
others may be occasionally found.
The possibility of the construction of
irregular molecules out of elements
of unequal powers seems, by the way,
to be worth examining.</p>

<p>Further developments of the theory
may have recently been made;
of course, the author does not claim
in this work to have laid down more
than its first principles. At present,
it seems, to say the least, to furnish
the best basis for the mathematical
investigation of the internal constitution
of matter that has been suggested,
and such investigations would
be almost certain to lead to valuable
results, whether confirmatory or otherwise.</p>

<h2>THE HOLY-WEEK OF 1869 IN HAVANA.<br />

<small>PALM-SUNDAY. THE TENEBRÃ. MAUNDY-THURSDAY.</small></h2>

<p>So much had been told me of the
antiquated observances of the Holy-Week
in Havana, of the religious
processions presenting to us of the
nineteenth century an image of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naÃ¯f</i> faith of the middle ages, of the
rare spectacle of a whole city in
mourning for the death of the Saviour,
that even had my duty not
called me to the church, my curiosity
would have carried me thither. As
it was, I resolved this Lent that, although
I resided at an inconvenient
distance from town, and ladies
who have no carriage of their own
find it sometimes unpleasant to go
on foot in a country where walking
is unfashionable, and considered even
unfeminine, yet I would disregard disagreeables
of every kind, and attend
all the impressive ceremonies of this
great week in the cathedral.</p>


<h3>PALM-SUNDAY.</h3>

<p>On Palm-Sunday, then, at six
o'clock in the morning, I got into
the nice, clean, well-managed cars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that pass our door every few minutes
all day long. The blessing of the
palm branches was not to commence
until a quarter after eight; but I like
to "take time by the forelock," and I
also feared that, as the "superior political
governor of Havana" had invited
"the grandees of Spain, the
titled of Castile, the knights grand
crosses, the gentlemen, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentiles hombres</i>,)
and civil and military functionaries
to contribute their assistance to
render the religious acts more solemn,"
there <em>might</em> be somewhat of a crowd,
and so I determined to arrive betimes
and secure for myself a seat where I
could both see and hear well.</p>

<p>The early morning in Cuba is
always delightful, and this 21st of
March was very bright and lovely,
the sky intensely blue and without a
cloud, and a cool breeze gently waving
the tall tops of the cocoa-nut
trees, and rustling the light, feathery
sprays of the graceful bamboos. The
white colonnaded houses of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cerro</i>
looked very pleasant among their
palms and laurels. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Carolina</i> was
in full bloom in some of the gardens,
its spreading, leafless branches covered
with great plumy tufts of rose-colored
filaments; honeysuckle vines
and the yellow jasmine climbed about
the railings, and the large, brilliant
flowers of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mar pacifico</i> completed
the floral landscape with that bright
"bit" of scarlet so agreeable to the
artistic eye.</p>

<p>As we approached the city, however,
the pretty houses became fewer,
and the mean suburban shops and
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">fondas</i> appeared more grimy than
ever in the bright sunlight; their
dirty awnings hanging in rags over
the badly-paved, broken sidewalk.
The houses, all of one or two stories,
their exteriors washed with blue, yellow,
lilac, or apple-green, wore a general
look of never being repaired,
and their gay coloring was faded,
spotted, stained, and smeared by the
exceeding dampness of the climate.
I had glimpses, too, as we passed,
into narrow streets so frightfully gullied
and filthy that they made me
shudder. The population of this
part of extra-mural Havana was not
more prepossessing in appearance
than its haunt.</p>

<p>In about half an hour we reached
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Campo de Marte</i>, (Field of Mars,)
a fine square which would be handsomer
if it were bordered with shade-trees.
Now it is an arid plain, with
a few straggling blades of grass in
patches here and there. On one of
the sides of this place stands the magnificent
mansion of the Aldamas, one
of the richest families in the island;
on another side, the principal railway
station. A great number of volunteers,
fine, stout, strong-looking men
generally, dressed in a blue and white
striped drill uniform, and armed with
short swords and bayoneted muskets,
were mustering in the middle
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Campo</i>, and a great rabble of
little blackies surrounded them, gaping
with admiration. At the eastern
extremity of the square we cut across
the commencement of what used to
be called the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Parque de Ysabel Segunda</i>;
but her statue has been pulled
down from its pedestal, and the promenade
has now no name. Here
again, around the pretty fountain
that represents Havana under the
form of an Indian maiden supporting
a shield that bears the arms of the
city, and surrounded by tropical fruits
and graceful plants, were plenty of
flowers; the blue, crimson, and purple
morning-glories, that had just opened
their radiant petals to the sun, were
the most vividly-colored I have ever
seen.</p>

<p>Passing the Tacon Theatre, we
soon reached the breach in the city
walls by which the cars enter. These
old fortifications, built by the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to keep out the Indians and the English,
are being slowly demolished. A
very fine white stone church is in
progress of erection close by.</p>

<p>The streets within the walls are
well paved and clean; the houses
mostly large and very strongly built.
They usually form a hollow square,
the centre being an open yard, containing
a few shrubs. The windows
of all the rooms reach from the floor
to the ceiling; they are without glass
and protected by iron bars; thick inside
shutters, into which two or three
glazed panes are inserted to admit the
light, close out any very bad weather,
wind or rain. The sidewalks are
usually not more than a foot and a
half wide; they look like ledges running
along the sides of the houses,
and are exceedingly uncomfortable
for pedestrians, as I found when I
descended from the car at its stopping-place
in front of the church <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San
Juan de Dios</i>, and proceeded on foot
to the cathedral.</p>

<p><i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San CristÃ³bal de la Habana</i>, the metropolitan
cathedral, is a large and
handsome edifice; it dates from 1724,
and although it has at the present
moment a very time-worn appearance,
it was repaired and beautified
only a few years since. Two towers
and three doors give an imposing air
to the front; the arched nave within
is lofty and spacious, and separated
from the aisles by massive pillars of
masonry. The whole of the interior
is painted in fresco, but is much deteriorated
by the excessive humidity
of the climate. The high altar, constructed
of beautiful jasper, under a
dome of porphyry, supported by
columns of the same material, was
built in Rome. On the gospel side
of the chancel is the tomb of Christopher
Columbus, whose ashes, inclosed
in a leaden box, rest within
the very wall of the sacred edifice.</p>

<p>Few persons had yet assembled in
the church, and I quickly obtained a
seat on one of the benches that are
placed along each side of the nave.
I was much pleased to find myself
exactly opposite to the crimson velvet-covered
arm-chair and reading-desk
reserved for the captain-general,
and to the less imposing but handsome
seats intended for the governor,
grandees, and municipality. I was
also just behind a row of arm-chairs
allotted to the civil and military functionaries.</p>

<p>In the chancel, concealing from
view the honored tomb, was raised
a purple velvet dais; beneath it stood
the purple velvet-covered throne and
reading-desk of the bishop. A great
black flag with a blood-red cross in
its centre leaned against the side of
the altar, on which was seen the emblem
of our faith swathed in violet
crape. An immense white curtain,
very artistically draped, was suspended
across the southern transept.</p>

<p>As the time passed, colored servants
made their appearance every
now and then, bringing their mistresses'
small low chairs and little
carpets; for the Havana churches,
like the Catholic churches of the
European continent, have no pews.
These servants wore the most brilliant
liveries, such as orange-tinted
indispensables, bright green waistcoat,
and red swallow-tail coat, forcibly
reminding one of the parrots
of the Cuban woods. A complete
canary-colored suit, surmounted by
a round, woolly, black head, produced
a very droll effect. The little chairs
were placed and the little carpets
spread wherever it was possible, so
that the marble floor of the space
between the official seats was soon
nearly covered. The greater number
of ladies, however, had no chairs,
but knelt, sometimes three on the
same carpet, during the whole of the
ceremony; that is, from eight till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
twelve, only changing their posture
occasionally to sitting on the ground,
with their feet doubled up on one side.</p>

<p>A little before eight o'clock, the
ladies began to arrive. Each one,
after she had knelt down and arranged
the folds of her voluminous
train to her satisfaction, dotted herself
over rapidly with a great number
of little crosses, and ended by kissing
her thumb. This ungraceful performance
is only a hasty, careless way of
making the three signs taught by the
church, which ought to be done thus:
The thumb of the right hand is placed
across the middle of the index, to represent
the cross. The first sign is
then made with it on the forehead,
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Por la seÃ±al de la Santa Cruz</i>&mdash;"By
the sign of the holy cross;" the second
on the mouth, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">De nuestros
enemigos</i>&mdash;"From our enemies;" the
third on the heart, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Libra nos, SeÃ±or,
dios nuestro</i>&mdash;"Deliver us, Lord, our
God." The sign as it is made usually
with us, and a kiss on the cross
represented by the thumb and index,
terminate this Spanish process of
blessing one's self.</p>

<p>The toilettes of some of the fair
Spanish and Cuban ladies present on
this occasion were of rich black silk,
with a black lace mantilla over the
head, half shading the face and shoulders.
There was an elegant simplicity
in this costume that seemed to me
to make it fit to be adopted in all
countries as a dress for public worship.
But the great majority were attired in
showy, expensive materials, quite devoid
of taste, especially in the choice
and harmony of colors. Black grenadine
and lace dresses, with light
belts, were numerous; satin stripes of
the deepest orange color were worn
by tall, slender, sallow damsels; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vert
d'eau</i>, that delicate water-green which
demands so imperiously the contrast
of lilies and roses, was donned by a
stout dame, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couleur de cafÃ© au lait</i>;
and one lady displayed an ample,
sweeping robe of that bright hue the
French call <i>Bismark content</i>, which
imparted an unearthly lustre to her
natural green tinge that made my
flesh creep. Lace mantillas over the
head were universal. Most were
black; but some young girls wore
white ones, fastened to their hair
with a bunch of rose-buds. There
were a great many blue silk bodices,
of the style affected by Swiss maidens;
and I remarked that the fat
ladies were very partial to low dresses
and short sleeves, with handsome
necklaces and bracelets. No one
wore gloves, and every one carried a
fan.</p>

<p>There was a great majority of expressive,
intelligent faces among these
belles, and there were plenty of large
black eyes, some very beautiful; and
there were pretty lips, which disclosed
with every smile two even rows of
pearly teeth; but there was also a
total absence of that fresh, healthy
look which, when united to youth,
constitutes beauty, whatever be the
shape of the features, and without
which no woman can be truly lovely.
As I contemplated, from my somewhat
high bench, the colorless cheeks
of the maidens, and the sallow, withered
skins of the matrons kneeling on
the marble floor before me, I remembered
the temperate zone with heart-sick
longing. "It seems," thought I,
"very delightful, when one reads of
it, to inhabit a clime where the trees
are ever green, and the flowers in perpetual
bloom; where snow and ice
are unknown; but look at these pallid
girls and their faded mothers&mdash;poor,
enervated victims of continual
heat! And oh! the many physical
miseries arising from want of active
exercise, and the sluggish torpor that
seems to invade the soul as well as
the body." And then the days long
gone by came back to me; the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
when "life went a-Maying with nature,
hope, and poesy;" the days
when I was young. "How I pity
you," I murmured, "pale Cuban
girls, who have never run free in the
daisied meadows to gather spring violets
and primroses; who have never
rambled with laughing youths and
maidens in the leafy woods of summer,
or sported among the dried fallen
leaves in the cool, bright days of autumn,
or made one in a merry evening
party around the sparkling, crackling,
glowing winter fire!"</p>

<p>A startling yelp, accompanied by
the whistling sound of a well-applied
whip, recalled my wandering thoughts.
The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">perrero</i>, in the exercise of his duties,
was ejecting a recalcitrant dog,
which had contrived to reach the
chancel unobserved. This functionary,
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">perrero</i>&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">anglicÃ©</i>, dog-man&mdash;is
peculiar to the cathedral. In all
the other churches of Havana, the
faithful are constantly grieved by the
unseemly spectacle of dogs roaming
at will within the sacred precincts,
even on the very steps of the altar.
The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">perrero</i> is distinguished by
a dark blue serge robe, descending to
his feet, and very much resembling
a gentleman's dressing-gown in form.
Around his neck he wears, as a finish,
a wide white frill. He carries, concealed
in the folds of this unpretending
and rather unbecoming costume,
a serviceable cowhide, which he uses
with a will upon all canine intruders;
and if he can, he concludes his admonishment
with a kick, it being generally
believed that a dog which has
received this final humiliation eschews
the cathedral for the rest of his days.</p>

<p>In the mean time, a considerable
number of persons had assembled
in the church, and the preparations
for the blessing of the palms were
completed. The highly ornamented
branches had been brought in, piled
up on great trays; the bishop's pastoral
crook had been placed leaning
against his throne, and the wax tapers
were lighted. The clergy, hastening
in procession to the great central
door, which was presently thrown
wide open, letting in a flood of light
and warm air, announced the arrival
of the prelate. It was rather difficult
to make a passage for him up to the
altar; for some good nuns had come
with a shoal of little girls, who had
been arranged so as to fill up every
interstice left by the occupants of the
chairs and carpets; but it was done
at last, and he advanced slowly and
with great dignity up the nave, blessing
all as he passed.</p>

<p>The prelate had scarcely taken his
seat under the dais, when the doors,
opening wide again, gave entrance to
the grandees, the municipality, and
a number of military and civil functionaries.
They were ushered to the
places assigned to them by four mace-bearers,
habited in the Spanish mace-bearing
costume of three hundred
years ago, and much resembling in
general appearance the tremendous
Queen Elizabeth's beef-eaters, who
seemed to my childish eyes the most
wonderful sight in the Tower of London.
They wore loose red velvet
tunics, trimmed with gold lace and
fringe; the castles of Castile were
embroidered on the breast, and the
lions of Leon adorned the sleeves;
an immense double ruff around the
throat; big, high, black boots and
buckskin small-clothes, and a wide-brimmed
hat turned up on one side,
with a red and yellow feather, completed
the costume.</p>

<p>The military and civil officers were
in full uniform, wearing their orders
and decorations; the noblemen and
gentlemen in evening dress, and displaying
on their breasts numerous ribbons
and brilliant stars. They were
nearly all venerable-looking, gray-haired
men, with that pensive, dignified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
gravity of demeanor peculiar to the
Spaniard.</p>

<p>The religious ceremony now began.
The palm-branches blessed were all
curiously plaited and lopped, until
they were but little more than a yard
high, only two or three small leaves
being left at the top. They were ornamented
with bows of bright-colored
ribbons, bunches of artificial flowers,
and gold and silver tinsel butterflies.
That intended for the prelate was covered
with elegant gold devices and
arabesques. Each of the grandees in
turn ascended the steps of the altar,
and, kneeling, received one from the
bishop, whose hand he kissed, and
then retired. When all had been distributed,
the procession was formed;
but I must confess that it disappointed
me exceedingly. I had expected
to see a grove of green, waving palms
moving along amidst the hosannas of
the multitude; but, as it was, all devotional
and picturesque effect was
totally wanting. I have since been
told that in the poorer churches,
which cannot afford to buy the plaited,
lopped, and gilded sticks that the
bad taste of the people prefer, the
simple branch, so exquisitely graceful,
is perforce adopted, and the procession,
consequently, a very pretty
sight.</p>

<p>In the cathedral, the whole ceremony
was cold and unimposing. There
was no summons from the outside,
with response from within. There
was no triumphal burst from the organ
when the Victor over sin and
death made his entry; no anthem to
remind us how the chosen will be
welcomed to heaven. The procession
descended by the southern wing,
and went out into the church porch,
where the psalms appointed were
sung; the great central door was
then opened, and it returned up the
nave to the altar.</p>

<p>The mass followed, and the bishop
delivered a short sermon. His voice
was very agreeable, and his manner
impressive.</p>

<p>As soon as the service concluded,
every one hastened away. There
were no loiterers&mdash;not even to see the
prelate leave the cathedral, which he
did on foot, his violet silk train borne
by one of the priests. It is, however,
but just to remark&mdash;if excuse be needed
for the haste with which the church
was cleared&mdash;that it was twelve
o'clock, and no one had breakfasted.</p>

<p>I was pleased to meet a friend at
the door, who insisted on my going
home with her, and I gratefully accepted
the invitation; for I felt tired
and faint. We accordingly got into
her <i>quitrin</i>, and in a few minutes
reached the welcome door.</p>

<p>The <i>quitrin</i>, the <i>private</i> conveyance
of Cuba, and an improvement on
the well-known <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">volante</i>, is a carriage
somewhat resembling the victoria,
but with two immense wheels; it is
swung, too, so easily that a person
not accustomed to the vehicle finds it
difficult to enter. The shafts are exceedingly
long, and the horse in them
trots, while a second horse, upon
which the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">calesero</i> rides, canters. This
second horse is attached to the carriage
by long traces at the left side,
and a little ahead of the shaft-horse.
The effect produced by the different
paces of the animals is very curious.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">calesero</i>, or driver, is always a
colored man; he is usually dressed in
a blue jacket, (though green, yellow,
and red are not unfrequent,) white
drill waistcoat and trowsers, and high
black leathern leggings, hollowed out
under the knee and standing up stiff
above it, resembling, in fact, the great
boots worn by French postilions, minus
the feet. These leggings are fastened
down the sides with straps and
silver buckles, and ornamented with
large silver plates. No stockings, but
low-cut shoes, leaving visible the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
naked instep, heavy silver spurs and
a stove-pipe hat, and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">calesero</i> is
considered an elegant turn-out.</p>

<p>The breakfast was waiting; a Creole
one, composed of soup made of
the water in which beef-bones, and
especially beef knee-caps, had been
boiled, flavored with onions fried in
lard; of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">vaca frita</i>&mdash;fried cow&mdash;little
pieces of beef of all shapes, fried also
in lard; of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ropa vieja</i>&mdash;old clothes&mdash;slices
of cold meat warmed up with
sauce; of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aporeado</i>&mdash;beef torn into
shreds of an inch and a half long and
stewed with a little tomato, green
peppers, garlic, and onions, (this dish
looks very like boiled twine;) of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">picadillo</i>&mdash;meat
minced as fine as possible
and scrambled in eggs, chopped onions
and peppers; of rice cooked with
little pieces of fat pork and colored
with saffron; of very nice pork-chops,
the best meat in Cuba, and very different
and far superior to Northern
pork; of boiled <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">yucca</i>, and ripe plantains,
very delicious to the taste, resembling
in flavor a well-made apple
charlotte. The bread was very good,
and more baked than it usually is in
the United States. Claret and water
was the general beverage, and the
meal finished with a cup of hot coffee
enriched with creamy milk, boiled
<em>without</em> the salt and aniseed that Creoles
almost invariably put into it. We
were waited on at table by two admirably-trained
Chinese, a people much
and justly esteemed in Havana as
house-servants and cooks.</p>

<p>It was nearly three o'clock when I
at last reached home; but not until
the next day did I hear of the four
unfortunate men shot that afternoon
in the streets, during the embarkation
of the two hundred and fifty political
prisoners for Fernando Po.</p>


<h3>THE TENEBRÃ.</h3>

<p>The following Wednesday morning,
I reached the cathedral just as the
gospel was commenced. At the conclusion
of the mass the service of the
<i>TenebrÃ¦</i> was very impressively chanted.
As I listened, my heart realized
all the grief and desolation of that
sad time. I could hear David bewailing
his outraged Lord and Son;
Jeremias lamenting over the ruins of
Jerusalem, over the crucified Victim;
dear mother church calling her children
to repentance in supplicating, tender
strains; and the three devoted
Marys sighing and weeping as they
climbed the steep of Calvary among
the crowd that followed our blessed
Saviour to the cross. At the termination
of this mournful music, just as
the confused murmur that recalled
the noise of the tumultuous masses
who, led on by Judas, came armed
with sticks to seize Jesus, died away,
a number of priests, completely enveloped
in ample black silk robes with
long pointed trains, their faces entirely
concealed beneath high-peaked
black silk hoods, advanced to the
front of the altar and knelt in a row
on the step before it. After a short,
whispered prayer, one of them arose,
and taking the black banner with the
blood-red cross, which I have already
mentioned, waved it for several minutes
in silence over his companions,
while they prostrated themselves on
their faces before the altar. It is impossible
to imagine a scene more lugubrious;
the black-robed figures lying
motionless, the mysterious hooded
form that seemed to tower above
them, the sinister flag, the deep silence&mdash;all
contributed to inspire a
sentiment of undefinable fear. Every
one present knelt, and in unbroken
silence the black banner was waved
over us. When we raised our heads,
the sombre assembly had disappeared
and the chancel was empty.</p>

<p>This, I was told, is a ceremony
that has been handed down from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
time of the primitive Christians of
Rome; but no one was able to explain
the meaning of it to my satisfaction.</p>


<h3>MAUNDY-THURSDAY.</h3>

<p>Maundy-Thursday found me bright
and early in the cathedral, and well
placed; for I was again just opposite
the seats reserved for the captain-general
and the governor, and just
behind those intended for the military
and civil officers.</p>

<p>With the exception of the bishop's
dais, throne, reading-desk, and cushion,
which were now of white damask
and gold, every thing was the same
as on Palm-Sunday. But the great
white curtain had been removed from
before the southern transept, and there
was now to be seen a magnificent
golden sepulchre, under a white and
gilded dome supported by columns.
The statue of a kneeling angel adorned
each side of this monument, to
which the officiating priest ascended
by six carpeted steps. Innumerable
wax tapers in silver candlesticks were
arranged on each side, their soft light
reflected by the silver and gold drapery
that lined the vault.</p>

<p>As on Palm-Sunday, the floor of
the nave was soon covered with carpets
and little chairs, all occupied an
hour before the mass began by women
and children, white and colored,
of every social grade, from the delicate
marchioness to the coarse black
cook. Not even the most elegant
lady present seemed in the slightest
degree annoyed by being elbowed,
and her satin dress rumpled, by some
pushing, saucy <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">morena</i>, (colored woman,)
who planted her chair or stool
just where she could contrive to
squeeze it in, with the most perfect
assurance that no one would question
her right to do so. I remarked, too,
that in the crowd of men who stood
in the aisles, the whites and blacks,
the rich and the poor, were on the
same terms and acting in precisely
the same manner toward one another;
and I felt convinced that nowhere
on earth was such social equality to
be met with as I witnessed in the
cathedral church of Havana.</p>

<p>I was admiring this absence of all
invidious distinctions in the house of
God, and rejoicing in the thought
that here, at least, the master had to
confess himself weak and humble as
the slave, the rich powerless as the
poor, when two men forced room for
themselves on my bench and by my
side. One had the look of a low grog-shop
keeper, the other of a whining
street-beggar; both were shockingly,
disgustingly filthy; both snorted and
spat in the most frightful manner, and
in the discomfort they caused me, I
arrived at the conclusion that all men
are equal&mdash;yes, <em>except</em> the clean and
the dirty; and I fretted and fumed
against the church officials who thus
abandoned the faithful washed to the
inroads of the faithless unwashed.
<i>Faithless unwashed!</i>&mdash;it is written wittingly;
for I cannot credit that piety
will exist with filthiness of its own
free will. No, sin and dirt are too
often bosom friends; but cleanliness
goes hand in hand with godliness.</p>

<p>I had, however, to bear and forbear
with my unpleasant neighbors,
whose propinquity induced a train of
thoughts somewhat at variance with
the solemnity I had come to witness.
I remembered, among other discrepant
subjects, the nickname given to the
Spaniards by the Cubans, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Patones</i>&mdash;"Big-Feet"&mdash;which
appellation has
frequently been used in skirmishes between
the insurgents and the Spanish
troops as a battle-cry. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva Cuba,
y mueren los Patones!</i> "Long live
Cuba, and death to the Big-Feet!"
the rebels would shout, and the soldiers,
very naturally enraged at a personal
defect being alluded to in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
terms, would fight like insulted heroes.
So I improved this opportunity,
having a long row of Spaniards before
me, to examine their lower extremities
and judge for myself what truth
there was in the discourteous designation.
After a careful and impartial
investigation, I believe that I can say
with justice that, though they do not
possess the exquisitely-formed, fairy-like
little feet with which every Cuban,
male and female, trips into this
world, they yet cannot be accused of
having large or clumsy ones. Most
of the Spanish feet I saw were certainly
much smaller than those of the
English or Germans, resembling, perhaps,
those of the French.</p>

<p>The toilettes of the ladies were
even more ball-like than on Palm-Sunday;
nearly every one wore low-necked
dresses and short sleeves, and many
white kid gloves. Rose-colored, pale
blue, yellow, and white silk robes trimmed
with lace and a multitude of
bows, and sometimes disfigured by preposterous
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paniers</i>, were general. The
hair was artistically dressed and adorned
with flowers, golden fillets, and
bright ribbons, and the white or black
lace mantilla thrown over the head
was as small and transparent as possible.</p>

<p>At a quarter past eight, the bishop
arrived with a numerous suite of clergy:
as on Sunday, it was with difficulty
he made his way through the sitting,
kneeling, becrinolined, and betrained
crowd that encumbered the centre of
the church.</p>

<p>Very shortly after, a flourish of
trumpets outside announced the coming
of the captain-general. The great
door was again thrown open, and he
entered, preceded by the mace-bearers,
and attended by SeÃ±or Don Dionisio
Lopez Roberts, superior political
governor of Havana, and a brilliant
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortÃ©ge</i> of noblemen, gentlemen,
and military and civil chiefs. When
all were seated, the scene as viewed
from my bench was very striking.
The resplendent sepulchre; the illuminated
altar, at which the mitred
prelate and his assistant priests were
officiating, all robed in white and gold;
the long row of handsome uniforms
on each side of the nave; the gay
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterre</i> of fair ladies, and the crowd
of spectators of every shade of color
from white to black that filled the
spaces between the massive pillars and
served as a background, all contributed
to form a whole most picturesque
and unique.</p>

<p>The beautiful service of Maundy-Thursday
now commenced; during
the celebration of it, the ceremony of
blessing the holy oils was performed;
and when the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria in excelsis</i> was
chanted, the bell was rung for the last
time until Holy Saturday. At the elevation,
I heard the silver staff of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pertiguero</i> resound several times upon
the pavement. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pertiguero</i> is, like
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">perrero</i>, a functionary peculiar to
the cathedral; his duty is to enforce
<em>kneeling</em> at the elevation on all strangers
visiting that church at the moment.
He carries a long silver staff, called a
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pertiga</i>, which he strikes with a clang
upon the marble floor when he perceives
any one inattentive to the strict
rule of the church&mdash;prostration in presence
of the host.</p>

<p>After the mass, the blessed sacrament
was carried in solemn procession
to the sepulchre, the captain-general
and the governor bearing the banner
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agnus Dei</i>, and all the grandees
and municipality joining in it.
The staves and cross-rods of the
banner and of the magnificent dais
held over the holy sacrament were all
of silver, and appeared to be very
heavy. The host was deposited in
the sepulchre, which was then locked,
and the golden key fastened to a
chain suspended by the bishop around
the neck of the captain-general, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
brought back to the church by him
on Good-Friday. The beautiful hymn,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pange lingua</i>, was sung very sweetly
the whole time; the Latin, which seems
so hard and harsh in our English
pronunciation, sounding very grand
and harmonious in these Spanish
mouths.</p>

<p>The church cleared very rapidly after
the mass; and when the last carriage
had conveyed its last occupant
home, no vehicle of any kind was permitted
to pass through the streets of
Havana. The soldiers now carried
their arms reversed, and all Spanish
flags were at half-mast. The city was
in mourning.</p>

<p>I was taken possession of by some
kind friends as I left the cathedral, and
accompanied them to their house close
by, where we found a welcome breakfast
awaiting us. It consisted of fish
and vegetables. We commenced with
turtle-soup; but not of the kind so loved
by Cockney aldermen, redolent of
spiced force-meat balls and luscious
green fat; this was an orthodox meagre
soup, incapable of doing harm.
Then came a nice fried fish called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rabi rubio</i>&mdash;red tail, and fried lobster,
all hot, which, however, I did not like
as well as boiled lobster cold with a
<i>mayonnaise</i> sauce. To these succeeded
shrimp fritters, roast turtle, and a
very delicate fish, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pargo</i>, the best
in these seas, and sometimes caught as
large as a large salmon, which it is
not unlike in form. Our vegetables
were white rice, eaten with black
Mexican beans stewed; yam, yucca,
and slices of green plantain fried of
a fine gold color, and very delicious.
Good bread, excellent claret, and native
coffee with an aroma resembling
that of the best Mocha, completed this
agreeable repast, which had been enlivened
by the pleasant conversation
of an intelligent, generous-hearted
Spaniard, and the smiles and jests of
his pretty Cuban wife and children.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, my friend Pepilla
and I, with the two eldest girls, Dolores
and Luisita, sallied forth into
the silent streets to visit some of the
churches, previous to attending the
ceremony of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Lavatorio</i>&mdash;washing
of feet&mdash;which was to be performed
in the cathedral at three o'clock.</p>

<p>The quaint old church of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan
de Dios</i> was the first we entered. Its
floor of hard-beaten earth was encumbered
with kneeling worshippers,
mostly colored, in earnest prayer before
a figure as large as life, representing
our blessed Saviour dressed
in a dark purple velvet robe, embroidered
with gold; his hands tied together
with a rope; his head crowned
with a gilded crown of thorns.
Long black ringlets of shiny hair
shaded his emaciated cheeks and fell
far down on his shoulders behind.</p>

<p>The high altar, which is a curious
work of bad taste, decorated with
little carved wooden angels wearing
black Hessian boots, was screened by
hangings of gold and silver tinsel;
and a gilded sepulchre, surrounded
by a great number of wax tapers, to
be lighted in the evening, was placed
in front of it.</p>

<p>As we came out of the poor little
church, a dirty negro boy, followed
by a dozen others, ran by us in the
street, making a great noise with a
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">matraca</i>, to the delight of his suite.
This <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">matraca</i> is a piece of wood about
eighteen inches long and ten wide;
on each side of it are affixed one or
two thick iron wires of the usual size
and shape of those old-fashioned metal
handles to drawers and trunks,
which always used to slip out of their
sockets when one gave a strong pull.
When the instrument is shaken, these
rattle against the wood, and in the
hands of an adept, and all colored
boys are such, made a terrible clatter.
From the <i>Gloria</i> on Maundy-Thursday
until the <i>Gloria</i> on Holy Saturday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">matracas</i> are employed instead
of bells and clocks, and boys from the
churches run through the streets with
them, to announce each hour of the
day.</p>

<p>The sepulchre at <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Felipe</i>, a
church whose interior is remarkable
for its air of bright cleanliness, was
very tastefully arranged with flowers
and tapers, and promised to look very
brilliant when lighted up. There also
was an image of our Saviour similar
to that we had just seen.</p>

<p>At <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Santo Domingo</i>, a large, handsome
edifice, we found a magnificent
sepulchre, in severer taste than the
two we had visited. In one of the
aisles, also, there was a group large
as life, and painfully life-like. It represented
our blessed Lord on the
cross, the blood streaming from his
nose and down his pale, thin cheeks
from the wounds inflicted by the cruel
thorns of his crown; a ghastly gash
in his side; his hands tom by the
dreadful nails; his wrists bruised and
cut by the cords with which he had
been bound; his knees so horribly
scarified by being dragged over the
rough ground that the bones of the
joints were visible; his feet mangled,
his whole body cut and scratched
and discolored by stones and blows.
At the foot of the cross stood the
holy Virgin, tearless, but with so
heart-broken an expression that to
look at her was to weep. St. Mary
Magdalen, her face pale, her eyes
swollen and red, was kneeling near
her. I could not bear the sight of
this agony, and turned away, saying
to myself, "Yes, it must have been
like this!"</p>

<p>In each of these three churches a
nun was sitting at a small table with
a tray before her, to collect the charitable,
voluntary offerings of visitors.
This was the first time I had seen
the slightest approach to money-asking
in the Cuban churches. During
the rest of the year there never are
collections of any kind made in them.
Nevertheless, the ladies of Havana
are very ready to contribute, and do
contribute liberally toward all religious
and charitable purposes; but
privately, not publicly. Indeed, both
Spaniards and Cubans are remarkably
compassionate and generous to
the begging poor, whom they gently
style <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pordioseros</i>&mdash;"For-God-sakers;"
and whom they never send harshly
away when unpleasantly importuned
or unable to give, as we Anglo-Saxons
so often do; but refuse with a
soft <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Perdone, por Dios, hermano</i>&mdash;"Pardon
me, for God's sake, brother;"
or, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Perdone, por Dios, hermanita</i>&mdash;"Pardon
me, for God's sake, little
sister."</p>

<p>It was now time to return to the
cathedral to secure places to see the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Lavatorio</i>. We found but few persons
there yet, and consequently had
a choice of seats. Some colored men
were busy placing an image of our
Saviour, similar to that we had seen
in the church of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan de Dios</i>,
on one of the altars in the southern
aisle, and it was touching to see the
veneration and love with which one
or other of them would raise from
time to time a ringlet of the shiny
black hair and kiss it.</p>

<p>Just before three o'clock two long
benches were set on the epistle side
of the altar, and presently a large
number of youths, attired in dark
red robes, entered the chancel&mdash;students
from the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Seminario de San Carlos</i>,
the theological college attached to
the cathedral.</p>

<p>The beautiful anthem that is chanted
during the ceremony of the washing
of feet, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mandatum novum do vobis</i>,
"A new command I give unto you,"
contains the distinctive precept of our
pure and holy religion, "Love one another;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and I could not help thinking,
when the Bishop of Havana girded
himself with a linen napkin and knelt
humbly to do his lowly task, that he
looked as if it were to him a real
labor of love, so charitable an expression
was there in his eyes, such
venerable grace in his manner. He
was assisted by several priests, one of
whom carried a large silver basin, another
a silver ewer full of water. The
water was poured over one foot only;
the prelate knelt as he wiped it, and
then kissing it, rose and passed to
the foot of the next boy, and so on.
When all were washed and wiped, the
bishop, looking heated and tired, resumed
the white and gold chasuble
he had laid aside, and, crowned with
his mitre, took his seat in front of
the high altar, surrounded by his
clergy.</p>

<p>The sermon then commenced; the
subject was, as always on this day,
the institution of the holy eucharist.
The preacher was a rather young
man, of agreeable aspect, earnest in
gesture and manner. His voice was
loud and clear, and the magnificent
Spanish language resounded in harmonious
and eloquent periods through
the vaulted nave. I remembered, as
I listened admiringly, the old Spanish
boast that theirs is the tongue in
which the Almighty can be least
unworthily addressed, and it did not
seem to me so vain and unmeaning
as I once deemed it.</p>

<p>With the conclusion of the sermon,
all the joy and love that had marked
the first part of the services of Holy
Thursday disappeared, and grief and
mourning now began again. Vespers
and the <i>TenebrÃ¦</i> were chanted,
and then the faithful withdrew.</p>

<p>In the evening all the inhabitants
of Havana poured into the streets:
the captain-general, attended by his
staff; the bishop, followed by his clergy;
the governor and the municipality;
the various corporations; large
family parties, and bands of young
men and boys; all went from one
illuminated church to another, seven
being the prescribed number, to kneel
before the splendid sepulchres, and
pray with more or less devotion. And
having accomplished this duty, all
adjourned to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Plaza de Armas</i>, a
handsome square, on one side of
which is the palace of the captain-general,
for the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">retreta</i>; that is, to
promenade while they listened to the
military band, which played some sacred
music very finely, and to eat
ices, the pious taking care that theirs
were <i>water-ices</i>.</p>

<p>The brilliant moon of the tropics
lighted up the scene, making all visible
as in the day, but with softer
tones; beneath her beams the beautiful
eyes of the ladies seemed of a
more velvety black, and their white
teeth glistened whiter between their
smiling lips. A gentle breeze, laden
with the sweet odors peculiar to night
in Cuba, sighed in the leafy boughs
of the <i>Laurel de India</i>, and all seemed
to me peace and good-will among
men, until I overheard one Creole
lady say to another, "Your husband
was a Spaniard, I believe?"</p>

<p>"I have been the wife of two Spaniards,"
replied the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cubana</i>; "but I
am happy to say that I have buried
them both!"</p>

<p>So I returned to my home deeply
meditating on the loveliness of nature
and the perversity of mankind.</p>

<h2>GOULD'S ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF RELIGIOUS
BELIEF.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></h2>


<p>In this book the author considers
what are the natural religious wants
of man's soul; he shows how these
cravings have given birth to various
religious systems; he considers
to what extent these systems are capable
of satisfying man's moral nature,
including in this survey every
ancient and modern belief except
Christianity; and proves that they
have all failed in a greater or less degree.
In a second volume he intends
"to show how that Christianity by
its fundamental postulate&mdash;the Incarnation&mdash;assumes
to meet all these instincts;
how it actually does so meet
them; and how failure is due to
counteracting political or social causes."
(P. 6.)</p>

<p>In other words, we have here a
treatise on religion from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ã  priori</i>,
rationalistic or philosophic stand-point.
The work is done as well as we could
expect from a non-Catholic author.
But like most other books of the
same stamp, written by those outside
of the church, it contains many errors
and false statements of facts. As it
has attracted no little attention, and
may be considered as a type of a
large class, we will give some quotations
from it, to show how cautiously
these books are to be read, and how
little confidence can be placed in
their assertions.</p>

<p>In his preface, the author says
that, besides the historical revelation,
"We have a revelation in our own
nature.... On this revelation the
church of the future must establish
its claims to acceptance." (P. 6.) If
Christ was God, as we firmly believe,
or even an inspired teacher
sent by God, the first and only thing
necessary is to know <em>what he taught</em>.
We must examine extrinsic evidence
which bears on the inspiration, authenticity,
and genuineness of the historical
documents in which his teaching
is contained. Intrinsic evidence derived
from the examination of that
teaching, and the consideration of its
complete harmony with man's spiritual
nature, must be assigned a second,
not a first place.</p>

<p>In the following passages, which
are certainly not a little ridiculous,
we have naturalism and materialism:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mysticism is produced by the combustion
of the gray vascular matter in the sensorium&mdash;the
thalami optici and the corpora
striata." (P. 355.)</p>

<p>"Prayer is a liberation of force. When
the emotions are excited, rapid combustion
of nervous tissue ensues, and the desire
that inevitably follows to do something is
the signal that an amount of power has been
generated, and equilibrium is disturbed."
(P. 387.)</p></blockquote>

<p>"Pantheism," we are told, p. 292,
"is the philosophy of reason&mdash;of reason,
it may be, in its impotence,"
(most assuredly!) "but of such reason
as man is gifted with here."</p>

<p>On page 319, speaking of Kant,
he says, "All the arguments advanced
by metaphysicians to prove the
existence of God crumbled into dust
beneath his touch." The truth is precisely
the opposite. Kant has "crumbled
into dust," and "all the arguments
adduced by metaphysicians to
prove the existence of God" remain
as unshaken as before he was born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>We are told, on page 79, that the
chief reason why all men have believed
in the immortality of the soul, is
because they could not form even a
conception of its annihilation. On
the contrary, any one who has ever
slept soundly can conceive its annihilation
without any difficulty, though
he might experience a good deal in
endeavoring to picture to himself an
existence without end. The doctrine
of the immortality of the soul, however,
even in philosophy, does not
rest on any such weak arguments.</p>

<p>That most wonderful fact of history,
in which the finger of God evidently
appears, namely, the preservation of
the Jewish people and their belief for
the past eighteen hundred years, in
the face of causes which, according
to every natural law, ought long ago
to have destroyed both creed and nation,
is accounted for (p. 205) simply
by their possession of "the Talmud,
which is a minute rule of life," etc.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Credat JudÃ¦us Apella.</i></p>

<p>"A man of thought will not steal,
because he knows he is violating a
law of sciology." (P. 278.) Were all
the men in the world "sciologists," and
"men of thought," we would not be in
the least inclined to trust our property
to the slender protection afforded
by a law of "sciology."</p>

<p>Every native of the "Gem of the
Ocean" will be delighted to learn
that "The suffering Celt has his Brian
Boroimhe, ... who will come again
... to inaugurate a Fenian millennium,"
(p. 407;) and students of history
will be surprised to know that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Marie Antoinette was informed of the
execution of Robespierre by a woman in the
street below the prison putting stones in her
apron, and then, with her hand falling on
them, scattering them on the ground." (P.
187.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Marie Antoinette was not alive
when Robespierre was executed. The
above incident occurred in the life of
Josephine Beauharnais.</p>

<p>On pages 133-134, we are told substantially
that for the first three or
four centuries after Christ, God governed
the Christian world directly!
Then, for a time, through the priests
alone! Afterward, for several centuries,
through kings alone! Now the
whole Christian world is ruled solely
by "the open Bible!" This is a good
example of how most non-Catholic
writers, when speaking of religion, are
always ready to sacrifice historical
truth for the sake of a generalization
or a rhetorical flourish.</p>

<p>"Its primitive organization (that is,
of the church) was purely democratic.
It recognized the right of the governed
to choose their governor." (P.
201.) We never knew before that
the people of Ephesus elected Timothy
to be their ruler, or the people
of Crete, Titus. We thought St. Paul
appointed both of them, and that he
told Timothy, "The things which
thou hast heard from me before
many witnesses, the same commend to
faithful men who shall be fit to teach
others also," (Epis. to Timothy ii. 2;)
and that he wrote to Titus, "... ordain
priests in every city, as I also appointed
thee." (Epis. to Titus i. 5.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When Hildebrand gathered up the reins
of government in his powerful hand to transmit
them to his successors, the ecclesiastical
elective primacy became an absolute supremacy."
(P. 201.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, if any difficulty
occurs to interfere with the plot
of a story, genii or fairies are straightway
introduced, perform very coolly
some astounding act, and <i>presto!</i> all
goes smoothly again. So, when Protestant
authors, in writing history,
come across any fact that stands in
the way of their preconceived anti-Catholic
theories, and logic cannot
remove it, they introduce "priestcraft,"
"Hildebrand," "the cunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Jesuits," etc.; these prodigies shoulder
the difficulty, walk off with it,
and then "it is all perfectly clear."
"Priestcraft," for instance, invented
the whole sacramental system and
foisted it on the church, <i>no one knows
when, where, or how</i>. "Hildebrand"
created the papal power. It did
not exist before his time. "The cunning
Jesuits"&mdash;ah! it would require
more than a <i>Thousand and One Arabian
Nights</i> to recount all the wondrous
achievements of these mythological
characters. Their latest act
has been the convocation of the present
&oelig;cumenical council, which they
rule with an iron hand. In fact, the
editor of this magazine, who is a
member of the council, has written to
us privately that now their power and
tyranny have become so great that
when the council is in full session
you have to ask a special permission
of "the cunning Jesuits" <i>if you desire
to sneeze or even wink</i>! (Isn't it
awful, reader? But this, you know,
is strictly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entre nous</i>. You mustn't
mention it to any body on any consideration,
unless, of course&mdash;as is not
at all impossible&mdash;you should hereafter
learn the same thing from the Atlantic
Cable!)</p>

<p>The saints of the Catholic Church
in modern times, we read, (p. 362,)
"are ecstatics, crazy nuns, and sentimental
boys." Such, therefore, were
Sts. Alphonsus Liguori, Ignatius, Francis
Xavier, Vincent de Paul, Charles
Borromeo, Francis of Sales, Theresa,
Jane de Chantal, and the two Catherines!
Well, we live to learn!</p>

<p>Mr. Gould, in order, it would appear,
to give an air of originality&mdash;or,
more correctly, aboriginality&mdash;to his
book, chooses to employ the term
<i>idol</i> as signifying any representation of
the Deity, (whether it receive divine
worship or not,) even the intellectual
conception or purely philosophic idea!
"Idolatry, then, is the outward expression
of the belief in a personal
God." (P. 176.) According to this
new nomenclature, we must style all
Christians <i>idolaters</i>!</p>

<p>"A fetish is a concentration of spirit
or deity upon one point." (P. 177.)
So with sticks, stones, and snakes, he
ranks the Sacred Host&mdash;the <i>Catholic
fetish</i>!</p>

<p>"The attribution to the Deity of
wisdom and goodness is every whit
as much anthropomorphosis as the
attribution of limbs and passions."
(P. 175.) So all worshippers of the
Deity (for the impersonal "God" of
pantheism is simply no God at all)
are <i>anthropomorphists</i> as well as
"idolaters"!</p>

<p>The last remark we have quoted
from the author is not true. The soul
<em>alone</em> is not the man; neither is the
body alone; but <em>soul and body</em> together.
Whoever, therefore, attributes
to God only the spiritual attributes
of man, cannot be properly
termed an anthropomorphist. In any
case, however, we most decidedly
object to any one's applying to sacred
things terms rendered opprobrious
by long and correct usage. The
effect of such an act is to confuse the
reader, and its tendency is to bring
what is holy into contempt. Perhaps
this was the author's intention.</p>

<p>As might easily be supposed from
the foregoing examples, the writer of
this book is one of the nineteenth century
<i>illuminati</i>, and in favor of "unrestrained
freedom of thought," etc., (the
chief enemies of which are historical
facts, sound logic, and common-sense.)
We will now listen for a moment
while, in good orthodox Protestant
fashion, he is "shouting the battle-cry
of freedom."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sacerdotal despotism succeeded in the
middle ages in concentrating all power over
consciences and intelligences in the hands
of an order whose centre was in Rome." (P.
138.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Reformation was a revolt against
that oppressive despotism of the Roman
theocracy which crushed the human intellect
and paralyzed freedom of action." (P. 139.)</p>

<p>"Under an infallible guide, regulating
every moral and theological item of his
(man's) spiritual being, his mental faculties
are given him that they may be atrophied,
like the eyes of the oyster, which, being useless
in the sludge of its bed, are reabsorbed."
(P. 140.)</p>

<p>"Theocratic legislation hampers every
man's action from the cradle to the grave....
The Israelites are a case in point. They
were tied down ... lest they should desert
monotheism for idolatry." (P. 204.)</p>

<p>"In a theocracy there is neither individuality,
personality, nor originality.... It
has restrained independence, shackled commerce,
conventionalized art, mummified
science, cramped literature, and stifled
thought," etc. (Pp. 207, 208.)</p></blockquote>

<p>What a pity that we poor "Romanists"
are so "benighted," etc.,
etc., that we don't in the least appreciate
these modern Solons, who seem
to think that every one should be
"progressive;" that is, spend his life
in dragging himself out of one humbug
only to fall into another; or, as
the wise critic of <cite>The Nation</cite> put
it a short time ago, in speaking of a
story in <span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span>, a
young man ought to be <i>like a ship</i>,
and devote his existence to <i>sailing
about</i>&mdash;on the boundless ocean, we
suppose, of infidel nonsense!<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Finally, we read, (pp. 138, 139.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Strange destiny, that of theology, to be
condemned to be for ever attaching itself
to those systems which are crumbling away,'
writes M. Maury; 'to be essentially hostile
to all science that is novel, and to all progress!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>We shall only remark that, were religion
to spend her time in pinning
her faith to all the "novel," "scientific,"
"progressive" systems that
spring up every day and straightway
begin to crumble, even while these
learned "sciologists" are tossing high
their caps in air and shouting out in
impressive chorus, "Where now is
theology?"&mdash;it would, we think, be
even stranger still.</p>

<p>We have devoted this much space
to showing up some of the falsehoods
in this book because it is not all false
nor all stupid; it is a philosophic and,
to some extent, a learned work; it is
written in a brilliant and attractive
style. This class of works dazzle;
but when written by non-Catholics,
they are not to be trusted. <i>The only
deep, and, at the same time, sound scholarship
in the world is in the Catholic
Church.</i> Those who protest against
her protest against the truth; even
the most learned among them, on many
most essential matters, are surprisingly
ignorant; but what they want
in knowledge they make up generally
in flash rhetoric and humbug novelty,
and that suits this enlightened
age just as well.</p>

<p>Too many persons, however, when
they see much that is true in a book,
are inclined to believe it all true;
and so with a considerable amount
of food they will swallow a great deal
of poison. This is a mistake. No
author is ever wholly wrong. The
falsest say many things that are true.</p>

<p>To show how error and truth may
be found side by side in the same
work, we will give some quotations
from our author in which his ideas
are sufficiently, or even strikingly, correct.</p>

<p>He thus speaks of asceticism:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From whatever motive an ascetic life is
undertaken, the result is accumulation of
force. The ascetic cuts himself off, as much
as possible, from all means of liberating
force. His voluntary celibacy and abstinence
from active work place at his disposal
all that force which would be discharged by
a man in the world in muscular action and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in domestic affection.... Withdrawal
from society intensifies his individuality,
and, unless the ideas formed in his brain
be such as can excite his emotion, he
becomes completely self-centred. But if
the object of his contemplation be one which
is calculated to draw out his affections, the
result is a coÃ¶rdinate accumulation of mental
and affectional power." (P. 348.)</p></blockquote>

<p>"Luther, a man of coarse and vigorous
animalism, was no ascetic."
(P. 350.)</p>

<p>The doctrine of Zwinglius, he tells
us, was simply pantheism, and that of
Calvin he considers undeserving the
name of Christianity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Alongside of Mohammedanism must be
placed a parallel development in Europe,
which, though nominally Christian, is intrinsically
deistic. Consciously it was not
so, but logically it was; and in its evolution
it proved a striking counterpart to Islamism.</p>

<p>"Zwinglius had taught that God was infinite
essence, absolute being, (<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Ïá½¸</span> Esse.)
The being of creatures, he said, was not
opposed to the being of God, but was in
and by him. Not man only, but all creation,
was of divine race. Nature was the
force of God in action, and every thing is
one. Sin he held to be the necessary consequence
of the development of man, and to
be, not a disturbance of moral order, but
the necessary process in the development of
man, who has no free-will.</p>

<p>"Calvin's idea of God was quite as absolute
as that formed by Zwinglius, but it was
not so pantheistic, though he did not shrink
from calling nature God. The Deity was
to him the great autocrat, whose absolute
will allotted to man his place in time and in
eternity. Beyond the pale of the church,
he taught, there was no remission to be
hoped for, nor any chance of salvation; for
the church was the number of the predestined,
and God could not alter his decision
without abrogating his divinity." (P. 266.)</p>

<p>"He swept away the sacramental system;
if he held to Christianity, it was in name,
not in theory, for his doctrine excluded it as
a necessary article. He deprived the atonement
of its efficacy and significance, and he
left the Incarnation unaccounted for, save
by the absolute decree of the divine and arbitrary
will which he worshipped as God."
(P. 267.)</p></blockquote>

<p>He thus speaks of the Reformation
and of its cardinal principle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But what was the result of the Reformation?
The establishment of a royal
along side of a biblical theocracy. The crown
became the supreme head to order what religion
is to consist of, how worship is to be
conducted, and what articles of faith are to
be believed." (P. 139.)</p>

<p>"The Scriptures were then assumed to
be the ultimate authority on doctrine and
ethics; they were supposed to contain 'all
things necessary to salvation, so that whatsoever
is not read therein, nor may be proved
thereby, is not to be required of any
man, that it be believed as an article of the
faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to
salvation.'</p>

<p>"This mode of arresting modification is
not, however, final, and cannot in the nature
of things be final; for, firstly, the significance
of the terms in which the revelation
is couched must be subject to the most conflicting
interpretations; and secondly, the
authority of the revelation will be constantly
exposed to be questioned, and the genuineness
of the documents to be disputed." (P.
134.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Buddhism he calls the <i>Protestantism</i>
of the East.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Its cold philosophy and thin abstractions,
however they might exercise the faculties
of anchorites, have proved insufficient
of themselves to arrest man in his career of
passion and pursuit; and the bold experiment
of influencing the heart and regulating
the conduct of mankind by the external
decencies and the mutual dependencies of
morality, unsustained by higher hopes, has
proved in this instance an unredeemed and
hopeless failure." (P. 353.)</p>

<p>"In confiding all to the mere strength of
the human intellect, and the enthusiastic
self-reliance and determination of the human
heart, it makes no provision for defence
against those powerful temptations before
which ordinary resolution must give way."
(P. 354.)</p>

<p>"The mass of the population are profoundly
ignorant of, and utterly indifferent
to, the tenets of their creed.... 'The
same results appear in the phases of Buddhism
beyond India,' says M. Maupied;
'in the north of Asia and in China it has
arrived at a sort of speculative atheism,
which has not only arrested proselytism,
but which is self-destructive, and which in
the end will completely ruin it.' It is not
a religion but a philosophy. (P. 355.)</p>

<p>"This close resemblance seems to have
been felt on first contact of Calvinism and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Buddhism; for we find in 1684 the Dutch
government <i>importing at its own expense
Buddhist missionaries</i> from Arracan to Ceylon
to oppose the progress of Catholicism."
(P. 353.)</p></blockquote>

<p>He is not in line with those, so
numerous in this age and country,
who hold to the Chinese notion that
intellectual and material progress is
every thing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the whole, it will be found that the
amount of happiness in a race not highly
civilized is far more general, and its sum total
far higher, than that of an over-civilized
race. The rude and simple Swiss peasantry
are thoroughly happy, while in a large city
like London, the upper stratum of society is
engaged in nervous quest of pleasure which
ever eludes them, while the lower is plunged
in misery. Besides, what is really meant
by the progress of the species? The only
tangible superiority of a generation over
that which has preceded it, appears to consist
in its having within its reach a larger
accumulation of scientific or literary materials
for thought, or a greater mastery over
the forces of inanimate nature; advantages
not without their drawbacks, and at any
rate of a somewhat superficial kind. Genius
is not progressive from age to age; nor
yet the practice, however it may be with the
science, of moral excellence. And, as this
progress of the species is only supposed, after
all, to be an improvement of its condition
during men's first lifetime, the belief&mdash;call
it, if you will, but a dream&mdash;of a prolonged
existence after death <i>reduces the whole
progress to insignificance</i>. <i>There is more</i>,
even as regards quantity of sensation, <i>in the
spiritual well-being of one single soul</i>, with an
existence thus continuous, <i>than in the increased
physical or intellectual prosperity</i>, during
one lifetime, <i>of the entire human race</i>."
(P. 59-60.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Nor does he appear to believe in
the Protestant method of converting
people, and causing them to "experience
religion." We read on page
358 that, while Wesley was preaching
at Bristol,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'one, and another, and another,' we are
told, 'sank to the earth. They dropped on
every side as thunderstruck.' Men and women
by 'scores were sometimes strewed on
the ground at once, insensible as dead men.'
During a Methodist revival in Cornwall,
four thousand people, it is computed, fell
into convulsions. 'They remained during
this condition so abstracted from every earthly
thought, that they staid two, and sometimes
three days and nights together in the
chapels, agitated all the time by spasmodic
movements, and taking neither repose nor
refreshment. The symptoms followed each
other usually as follows: A sense of faintness
and oppression, shrieks as if in the
agony of death or the pains of labor, convulsions
of the muscles of the eyelids&mdash;the eyes
being fixed and staring&mdash;and of the muscles
of the neck, trunk, and arms; sobbing respiration,
tremors, and general agitation,
and all sorts of strange gestures. When
exhaustion came on, patients usually fainted,
and remained stiff and motionless until their
recovery.'" (P. 358.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, in speaking of the "diverse
forms of ceremonial expression," he
says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Jacob leans on his staff to pray, Moses
falls flat on his face, the Catholic bows his
knee, and <i>the Protestant settles himself into a
seat</i>." (P. 114.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We don't know whether to prefer
Protestant taste, or Feejee, or Hindoo.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thus, out of love to a mother, <i>the Feejee
eats her</i>, and the European erects a
mausoleum. The sentiment is the same,
but the mode of exhibition is different." (P.
115.)</p>

<p>"The Hindoo represents Brahm, the
Great Absolute, absorbed in self-contemplation,
as a man wrapped in a mantle, <i>with
his foot in his mouth</i>, to symbolize his eternity
and <i>his self-satisfaction</i>." (P. 188.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We remarked before that the author
of this book displays considerable
learning. Here is a specimen
which gives some pleasant information
about the old Saxon laws:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Three shillings were deemed sufficient
compensation for a broken rib, while a fine
of twenty shillings was inflicted for a dislocation
of the shoulder. If a man cut off
the foot or struck out the eye of another, he
was compelled to make satisfaction with fifty
shillings. Each tooth had its fixed price:
for a front tooth, six shillings were demanded;
for a canine tooth, four; and for a molar,
only one shilling; the pain incurred by
a loss of a double tooth, however, led King
Alfred to alter this portion of the law, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
unjust, and he raised the price of a molar to
fifteen shillings." (P. 364.)</p></blockquote>

<p>He thinks that the idea of compensation,
which is here certainly clearly
set forth, gave rise to the religious
idea of sacrifice.</p>

<p>We will close with a favorable specimen
of his style. He thus describes
Greece:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Under a blue sky, in which the clouds
lie tranquil like lodged avalanches, in the
midst of a twinkling sea, strewed with fairy
groups of islands, is a little mulberry-leaf of
land attached to a continental bough, a little
land ribbed with mountain-chains of rough-hewn
marble, veined with purple gorges,
pierced with winding gulfs; a land of vineyards
and olive-groves, where roses bloom
all the year, and where the pomegranate
holds its glowing cheek to a sun that is never
shorn of its rays." (P. 148.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We have given these quotations at
length, partly because they are a little
remarkable as coming from such a
source, but chiefly to show that a
book may be excellent in some respects,
and nevertheless contain very
many most false things. Our end
will have been attained if we have
shown that whatever comes from non-Catholic
pens, <i>even the best, is not to
be trusted</i>, whenever, directly or indirectly,
matters pertaining to philosophy,
theology, or ecclesiastical history
are treated of. These books at best
are half-blind guides; and such are
never desirable, and generally dangerous.</p>

<h2>UNTYING GORDIAN KNOTS.</h2>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p class="center">LADY SACKVIL'S JOURNAL.</p>

<p>"I have been playing the part of a
peri at the gates of paradise. I have
been watching Mary Vane with her
child. My life looks to me unbearable.
I am a blunder on the part of
nature. I have the passions of a man
and the follies of a woman. This is
the last entry I shall make in this
book. Once for all I will put my
agony into words, and then throw
this wretched record of three months
into the canal, to rot with the other
impurities thrown daily into the sluggish
flood.</p>

<p>When first I allowed myself to exercise
my power over Vane, it was
from mere coquetry and love of excitement.
I wished to reassert my
sway and punish his former cruelty.
Later I dreamed of a Platonic love,
<i>Ã  la</i> RÃ©camier and Chateaubriand.
True, one pities Mesdames de Chateaubriand,
viewing them as a class;
but they must suffer for their bad management.
I did not recognize, I do
not recognize the claims of so-called
duty; I lack motive. Virtue as virtue
does not attract me; neither does
sin as sin attract me. I want to have
my own way. Gratified self-will has
afforded me the only permanent enjoyment
of my life; but it has this
disadvantage. While you rule your
will and indulge it for fancy's sake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the pleasure is unquestionable. When
your will begins to rule you, there
is no slavery so galling. I had not
thought of this; I know it now.</p>

<p>Once for all, I put my torture into
words. <em>I love him.</em> Ten years ago
I buried my heart&mdash;in sand or sawdust,
or something else, where grass
and flowers cannot grow. It has
risen now in an awful resurrection,
and taken possession of me. He
might have been all mine. I wish to
hate his wife, and am forced to honor
her profoundly. I <em>cannot</em> leave this
place. My will refuses to let me go.
Oh! if I stay here and do not say
one word, where is the harm? And
if he should utter the word I dare
not say&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Amelia paused shuddering. "O
subtle&mdash;O inexorable horror!" she
said. Then, enveloping the book in
paper, she carried it out onto the balcony,
and dropped it into the canal,
and heard the splash, and marked
with satisfaction its disappearance beneath
the dull green water.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;that's gone!" she said,
and reÃ«ntered the room. Her face,
which reflected every change of mood,
grew very white.</p>

<p>"It is <em>not</em> gone!" she cried; and
pressing her hands to her breast exclaimed,
"It is here; it is my double&mdash;my
bosom serpent! O God!
how it gnaws!"</p>

<p>She went to a press, and pulling
open drawers and slides, sought something
eagerly. Then, as if forgetting
the object of her search, paused in
deep thought, and finally rang the
bell violently.</p>

<p>Josephine came promptly, but unsurprised,
being used to vehemence
on the part of her mistress.</p>

<p>"You may pack my trunks. I shall
leave Venice to-morrow."</p>

<p>The maid proceeded to take out
dress after dress and fold them. When
one trunk was packed, Lady Sackvil
who had been standing on the balcony
in the blazing sun, looking down
into the water, glanced over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"You may pack the other boxes
another day," she remarked calmly;
"I shall not go to-morrow. Your
dinner-bell is ringing; you can go."</p>

<p>She locked the door behind Josephine,
and then returned to her
researches in the press. At last she
produced a small vial of laudanum,
and, sitting down before the toilette-table,
poured a little into a glass and
paused. "I wish I knew how much
to take," she said ponderingly; "it
would be so tiresome to take too little
or too much." Then she fell to
considering herself in the mirror&mdash;looked
anxiously at the faint commencement
of a wrinkle between her
eyebrows; and pushing back her hair,
revealed a gray hair or two hidden
beneath the dark locks so full of sunny
gleams. "I will do it," she said,
and then took a few drops; then
paused again. "I can't&mdash;I won't!"
she said violently. "I'm afraid; I'm
afraid of hell&mdash;I'm afraid of that horrid,
clammy thing they call death!
I'm afraid of making poor, good little
Flora miserable! Oh! I'm afraid of
myself, dead or alive," she moaned,
rocking herself to and fro, in a passion
of regret and pain.</p>

<p>At last the paroxysm passed. She
poured back the laudanum, washed
the glass, replaced every thing accurately,
and threw herself on the couch.
There, overcome by the drug, to which
her healthy frame was wholly unaccustomed,
she fell into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>The plea of weariness afforded an
excuse for going early to bed. When
she awoke the second time, the Campanile
clock was striking two. A
rain was falling, pattering on the canal,
dripping and trickling from the
eaves and from the pointed traceries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
above the windows. She got up, put
on a white wrapper, and went out
onto the balcony. The rain felt cool
on her burning head. It drenched
her to the skin, and dripped from her
hair. Yet still she stood there, crying
bitter tears that brought no relief,
shaken with sobs that she with difficulty
prevented from becoming cries.
She wrung her hands with grief, and
passion, and pain. Night added nothing
to the darkness in her soul;
dawn brought neither light nor hope
of change; and when at last she
went in from the cold, gray morning
light, to change her wet clothes and
creep into bed, it was to a second
dose of laudanum that she owed the
temporary bliss of oblivion.</p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>"If you're looking for Mr. Nicholas,
Miss Vane, he's gone down to the
first floor," said Deborah, the morning
after Lady Sackvil's visit.</p>

<p>Mary went to Mr. Holston's writing-room;
no one was there; passed
on through drawing-rooms, dining-room,
and ante-chambers, without
meeting a soul, and at last found
herself standing outside Lady Sackvil's
music-room. Knocking and receiving
no answer, she opened the
door, which moved noiselessly on its
hinges, and lifted the heavy crimson
curtain. Her husband was standing
with his back to the door, leaning
against the mantel-piece. Lady Sackvil
stood before him, her face buried
in her hands. He spoke, but in a
voice so hoarse and dissonant that
Mary fancied for an instant there was
a third person with them.</p>

<p>"Be satisfied with your success,
Amelia," he said. "You have lighted
the fire of hell in my heart. You
have turned my affections away from
my wife, who is too pure for things
like you and me to love. It may
add to your satisfaction to know that
there is one person on earth I despise
more than Lady Sackvil, and that person
is myself."</p>

<p>He turned, and saw his wife standing
in the doorway.</p>

<p>"How much have you heard?" he
asked calmly, without showing either
surprise or annoyance.</p>

<p>"Enough to make me say, 'God
help us both,'" she replied.</p>

<p>"Amen," he said, and left the room.
Mary was about to follow him, when
a look of entreaty from Lady Sackvil
checked her. In another instant
Amelia was crouching on the ground,
her face buried in the folds of Mary's
gown. There was dead silence
in the room. The ticking of the
Louis Quatorze clock on the mantel
and the flap of a window-curtain
were the only sounds to be heard.
Charity pleaded for the wretched woman
kneeling at her feet. Nature
cried, "Follow him; tear from him
some consolation; make him wake
you from this nightmare, and say he
loves you!" Charity conquered. Mary
bent over Lady Sackvil to raise
her from the ground; but at the first
touch, Amelia lifted her head, exclaiming,
"I will never rise; I will
die here unless you say you forgive
me!"</p>

<p>"How can you ask pardon," replied
Mary "for an injury you have
only just completed?"</p>

<p>Amelia crouched still nearer to the
ground.</p>

<p>"So help me heaven!" she said in
a voice of agony, "I never meant
to speak. He came to-day&mdash;oh! you
who possess him, can't you see how
it happened; how I forgot every thing&mdash;resolutions,
dignity, decency&mdash;and
spoke?"</p>

<p>"Why do you say I possess him?"
asked Mary bitterly. "You heard
him say that you had turned away
his heart from me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have not turned it toward myself.
He repulsed me like a dog.
Oh! if there were a hole underground
where I could hide, I would crawl
into it." And she flung herself on her
face with a despairing groan.</p>

<p>Mary knelt down beside her. "We
are both in the presence of God,"
she said; "and I forgive you now even
as I hope to be forgiven."</p>

<p>Amelia rose with difficulty, made
an effort to reach the bedroom door,
tottered, and would have fallen but
for Mary's assistance, who unlocked
the door and helped her to a sofa.
Then, looking round the room for
some restorative, her eye rested on a
little vial standing in a crimson wine-glass.
She took it up and saw that it
was labelled "laudanum."</p>

<p>"Have you taken any of this?"
she asked, carrying it to the sofa.</p>

<p>"Only yesterday&mdash;never before,"
Lady Sackvil answered feebly. "It
would make me sleep now and do
me good. You might give me a few
drops; or rather, no, leave it with
me," she said, holding out her trembling
hand. "I can take it, if necessary,
myself."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Mary, and
going to the window, she threw the
bottle over the railing. Then sitting
down beside Amelia, she took the
feverish hand in both her own. "Promise
me, swear to me, that you will
not take that or any other narcotic
or stimulant."</p>

<p>"You have prevented me from
doing you the only kindness in my
power," said Amelia, sitting up and
pushing the hair back from her crimson
temples. "You have forgiven
me; you have treated me like the
Christian you profess to be. I meant
to repay you by taking myself out of
this loathsome world."</p>

<p>"Repay me by living and repenting,"
answered Mary earnestly. "Promise
me not to make an eternity of
this passing anguish. There is work
for you to do; there is heaven for
you to win. Promise me to live, and
to live for God."</p>

<p>Lady Sackvil looked at her silently
for several minutes. Then she said,
"I acknowledge one thing&mdash;I acknowledge
that you are good, in
spite of circumstances." She lay
down and turned her face to the
wall. "I will live," she said wearily,
"if you will help me to live; otherwise
I shall die."</p>

<p>"I will help you," Mary said.
"Now I must go. Shall I ring for
your maid?"</p>

<p>"No. If Flora can come, I will
have her; otherwise, I would rather
be alone. I feel wretched and heavy,
and shall fall asleep presently."</p>

<p>Mary found Mrs. Holston in her
sitting-room. "Lady Sackvil is ill,
and wants you," she said breathlessly;
for, now that her duty was done,
every minute seemed an age until she
could see Nicholas. "Don't stop me,
please; I <em>must</em> go." As she put her
hand on the hall door, Mr. Holston
opened it from outside. She brushed
by him without a word; but he saw
her blanched face, and followed her
with his eyes as she ran up-stairs.
"The blow has fallen," he said to
himself, as he hung his hat in the
hall. "Poor, poor child!"</p>

<p>She went to the study door and
turned the handle. It was locked.
She paused a moment, thinking her
husband would admit her; then walked
on through the gallery to her own
room, shut the door, and sat down
in her little sewing-chair. She was
stunned; mercifully stunned. It all
seemed a dream, from which there
would soon be an awakening. Of
course, it could not be true that her
husband had shut her out from his
confidence. She felt too dull to understand
all this. "God knows what
it means," she said half-aloud; "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
don't." How far from her eyes seemed
the tears, crowded back, as it were,
to make the weight on her heart more
unbearable. "Some women faint or
cry out when they are hurt," she
thought idly; "I wonder why I
don't? I feel so dumb, so gray, so
smothered."</p>

<p>A knock came at the nursery door.
Dragging one foot after the other, she
went and opened it. Deborah started
at sight of her face, but made no
comment. "It is time to take baby,"
she said cheerfully. "The cap'n's asking
for you. He can't think what's
become of you." Mary darted past
her and ran out into the gallery.</p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>Nicholas was sitting at the study
table, looking over papers. He rose
and drew forward a chair for her, and
then sat down again.</p>

<p>"The best thing that could happen,
under the circumstances," he said,
"has come to pass. I am appointed
to join the French army in the Crimea,
for purposes of study. Here is
the appointment. These are letters
from General Scott and from the Secretary
of War. Just glance at them,
if you please."</p>

<p>She read them, almost without comprehending
their meaning. "When
do you go?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning. It is the
best thing to do, under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"Yes, the best under the circumstances,"
she repeated after him. He
looked at her anxiously, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"What are you to take with you?"
she asked, rising from her chair. "I
must go and look over your clothes."</p>

<p>"All the military traps I have here,
of course; not much besides, for I
would rather buy what I want. Don't
trouble yourself, my&mdash;" He paused.
"I will see to every thing."</p>

<p>"No, I want to do it myself," she
said.</p>

<p>"I must go and speak to Holston
about your money matters while I am
gone. He will do every thing a brother
could do."</p>

<p>"Every thing," she said. He looked
at her again uneasily, and seemed
about to speak; then left the room.
"I've killed her," he thought; "but
words are mere insults now."</p>

<p>He was gone, and without one
word of explanation. It was, then,
no nightmare, to be dispelled by a
change of posture. There was no
awakening for her. It was all true!</p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>Mary was alone with the baby.
Georgina's tiny hand was clasped
around her mother's finger; rosy
cheek and dewy lip invited many a
loving maternal caress. At least here
was love, without anxiety or heart-ache.
"My love for this child, to
whom I have given life, is faint in
comparison to God's love for his
creatures," she thought. "My soul
shall rest on him, as Georgie rests in
my arms. He knows the way out
of this blackness. I will follow him
trustfully."</p>

<p>The day was hard to bear; wife's
work without wife's consolation. Sewing,
sorting, packing, filled the hours
too closely to leave much time for
active grief. They were services that
could easily have been performed by
a servant; but Mary, amid the perplexity
which clouded her life, kept
one purpose clearly before her&mdash;to
fulfil her duties thoroughly toward
her husband, and even toward the
unhappy woman who had poisoned
her happiness, and thus prevent further
entanglement.</p>

<p>The dinner hour, whose claims prevail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
over every other external circumstance
in life, was lived through,
thanks to the presence of Italian servants,
who do not expect friends to
look happy on the eve of separation,
and are ready to melt into tears of
sympathy at a moment's warning.
Vane passed the evening in his study,
transacting business with Mr. Holston
and a lawyer; Mary in his dressing-room,
attending to "last things."</p>

<p>At intervals through the weary
night she heard him moving about
in the library. About five o'clock,
the peculiar click of the hall door
told her that he had gone out. Then
came two hours of sleep, and memory's
dreadful reckoning when she
awoke.</p>

<p>Breakfast was served at nine o'clock.
After going through the dismal form
which represents eating on such occasions,
Nicholas went to the window
to watch for the gondola. "Will you
come here, Mary?" he said.</p>

<p>She went to him, and measured
despairingly, as he talked to her, the
gulf which separated them spiritually
while they stood side by side.</p>

<p>After giving various directions as to
material arrangements during his absence,
he said, "I went to confession
this morning, and to your Padre Giulio."
She looked up eagerly into his
sad face, stern with the rigidity of repressed
emotion. "After confession,
I saw him in his own room, and told
him all the circumstances of the last
three months, out of the confessional,
in order that you may feel free to seek
from him the advice and consolation
I have shown myself unfit to give
you."</p>

<p>"I don't want to speak of these
things to any one," Mary answered.</p>

<p>"I have no right to urge you," he
said; "but you will oblige me very
much by speaking to him once, at
least, upon the subject. I cannot
tell you the weight it added to my
self-reproach to find him ignorant of
the wrongs you have suffered, knowing
as I do the entire confidence you
repose in him personally. You have
been very loyal to me, Mary; I shall
never forget it."</p>

<p>"Of course, I told him nothing
concerning any one but myself."</p>

<p>"I have another favor to ask,
which I should not ask if you were
like other women."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>He took a note from his desk, and
gave it to her unfolded. "After reading
that, I beg you to give it to Lady
Sackvil."</p>

<p>She flushed, and a slight trembling
passed over her. Then she folded the
note and put it into her pocket. "I
will give it to her without reading it.
I trust you."</p>

<p>Nicholas looked at her with an expression
of reverence in his face. "I
will earn the right to tell you how
deeply I honor you," he said. "Any
thing I could say now would appear
like a new phase of moral weakness;
but I will earn the right to speak."</p>

<p>As Mary met his eyes, fixed upon
her with a look of reverential tenderness,
her heart cried out for him.
She longed to throw herself upon his
breast; to urge him to put off this
dreadful parting, and treat the wretched
delusion he had yielded to as a
dream. But something unanswerable
within her soul warned her to let him
leave her, that his resolutions might
grow strong in solitude; that he might
learn by aching experience the worth
of the love and sympathy he had
slighted. Therefore, she only said,
"All will be well; I know it, I feel
it." And he answered, "I accept
your words as a prophecy, and thank
God for them. One favor still I must
ask. Mary, you will write to me?"</p>

<p>"Constantly."</p>

<p>"God bless you. Holston will
find out when the mails go. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
will be the one happiness of my
life to look forward to your letters,
which must give me every detail
about yourself and about our child.
Mary, it will be my one earthly hope
to look forward to the time which
shall end my exile."</p>

<p>The gondola was at the door, and
George Holston had already taken
his place in it. Vane clasped his
wife's hands in his, kissed them passionately,
and rushed from the room.</p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>"I never knew her to faint before,"
Deborah's voice was saying, as Mary
emerged from an abyss of peaceful
oblivion, to find herself deluged with
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau de Cologne</i>, and lying on the bed
in her own room.</p>

<p>"Poor little soul!" answered Mrs.
Holston's gentle voice. "It was a
terrible shock, his going so suddenly.
But, hush now, she is coming to herself."</p>

<p>No, not to herself; to a consciousness
of nameless agony; to a sense of
restlessness, without physical strength
for action; to a crushing weight of
misery which she must ask no living
soul to share.</p>

<p>After some minutes, which seemed
like hours of struggling to recover
breath, and voice, and senses, she
succeeded in thanking her kind nurses,
and asking them to leave her alone
for a little while.</p>

<p>An hour's solitude had restored her
to complete consciousness, when a servant
knocked on the door and asked
whether she had any further occasion
for the gondola, which had returned
from carrying Captain Vane to the
steamer. Her husband's request that
she would see Padre Giulio occurred
to her. Life must be taken up somewhere;
why not in the performance
of that duty, which would become
harder with every day it should be
deferred?</p>

<p>If she called upon Deborah for assistance,
she would be prevented from
leaving the house; so her preparations
must be made alone. Giving orders
for the gondola to wait, she put
on hat and shawl with trembling
hands, and walked down the long
flights of marble stairs, holding on
to the balustrade for support. It
was useless to attempt her mission
in that condition; perhaps an hour's
row that soft, gray, overshadowed
morning might restore her nerves to
equilibrium. "Put up the awning
and row on the lagoon for an hour,"
she said to the gondoliers. "Then
take me to the Piazza San Marco
without my giving you any further
directions."</p>

<p>Through the open windows of the
ducal palace she could see tourists
wandering about, <i>Murray</i> in hand.
Soldiers were lolling under the arcades;
sight-seers were hurrying through to
and fro, taking advantage of the cool
day to get through a double amount
of work. A sacristan was cleaning
down the steps of Santa Maria della
Salute, flinging away the broom, and
sitting down to rest after the labor of
sweeping each step.</p>

<p>Then came a long period of quiet,
broken only by the steady dip of oars,
and an occasional remark in gondolier
slang made by the two boatmen.
Pearly sky and pearly sea, a soft
breeze and monotonous motion exercised
a soothing influence over poor
Mary, who never resisted comfort, no
matter in how homely a form it might
come. On the steps behind the Armenian
convent sat a monk, looking
over the lagoon. He was a commonplace
old man enough in appearance,
some insignificant lay brother resting
from his labors in the garden. He
saw the boat approach, and noticed
probably the expression of suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
on Mary's face; for as she passed,
a look of kindness, that was in itself
a benediction, came into his wrinkled,
brown face, and sank into her poor
wounded heart, never to be forgotten.
From that day she remembered the
old Armenian in her prayers as one
who had helped her in the sorest trial
of her life.</p>


<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>In the afternoon came Mrs. Holston,
for once in her life in a hurry.
"I am ashamed to disturb you," she
said to Mary. "I am ashamed to
say why I have come. Amelia is
behaving in the most extraordinary
manner. She refuses to get up, and
refuses to see the doctor. She says
no one can do her any good except
you. I told her she was very selfish,
and she said she didn't care; so now
I can only ask you, for charity's sake,
to come down and speak to her."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mary, by a stupendous
effort speaking in a natural
tone; "I will come in a few minutes.
I have a little note for your sister from
my husband that she may be glad to
get. Did he find time to come and
bid you good by?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, but he looked dreadfully
worried and unhappy, of course.
I think it extremely ill-natured of the
War Department to make him leave
home so suddenly. That must have
been what made you look so frightfully
ill yesterday morning. I was
very much alarmed about you."</p>

<p>"I will follow you directly," said
Mary, escaping to her own room for
a moment of preparation before facing
the enemy of her peace.</p>

<p>But that her peace was hopelessly
shaken, she no longer feared. The
interview with Padre Giulio had been
full of consolation; for to this impartial
listener Vane had said many
things that the fear of seeming insincere
had prevented him from expressing
to his wife. It was plain
that delicacy toward herself and
compassion for Lady Sackvil had
made him leave Venice. She now
felt that it would show a lack of
faith to doubt that the future would
bring happiness to them both; that
their reunion would be one such as
death itself confirms instead of severing.</p>

<p>She found Lady Sackvil looking
enchantingly lovely. Her hair, dark
brown, with golden red lights in it,
was plaited in two great braids; her
cheeks were flushed; her eyes were
closed, showing their long lashes and
large, full lids to advantage. By the
quivering of her lips, Mary knew that
she felt who was with her; but it was
some minutes before she opened her
eyes.</p>

<p>"It was kind in you to come," she
said at last, looking up into Mary's
face. "I am very grateful. Flora
says I'm horribly selfish to send for
you, and no doubt I am; but it is
better than going crazy, I suppose."</p>

<p>Mary laid her hand on the throbbing
forehead, and felt the quick
pulses. "Do you feel really ill?"
she asked; "or is this merely a state
of nervous excitement?"</p>

<p>"I'm not ill. I was never seriously
ill in my life. I am only going distracted.
I had an idea you might do
something for me."</p>

<p>"The first thing to be done is to
quiet your nerves and reduce the
fever. Then we will think of other
remedies. I will get Flora's little
medicine-chest, and see what its resources
are."</p>

<p>The morning passed quietly in tending
Lady Sackvil, varied by occasional
visits to the nursery. It was hard to
bear, "but no harder than any thing
else would be now," thought Mary.
"If I can save this poor soul, it will
be worth suffering great as this."</p>

<p>By two o'clock, Amelia was physically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
more tranquil. Her health
had always been excellent, and her
temperament, though utterly undisciplined,
by no means inclined to
morbid excitability.</p>

<p>"I have a note for you," said Mary;
"will you read it?"</p>

<p>"From whom?"</p>

<p>"From my husband."</p>

<p>Lady Sackvil shuddered, and turned
away.</p>

<p>"Don't give it to me," she said.
"Read it, and tell me what it says."</p>

<p>Mary read it through to herself;
then, mastering her voice, read aloud
the following words:</p>

<p>"I was unjust to you yesterday. I
treated you with cruelty. For what
has happened, I am more responsible
than you, because I have been under
better influences. We shall never
meet again. God bless you, and
grant us both genuine repentance!"</p>

<p>Amelia made no comment or reply.
A quarter of an hour later, she said,
"You go to confession very often, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Once a week."</p>

<p>"Who is your confessor?"</p>

<p>"Padre Giulio, at St. Mark's."</p>

<p>"Is he old?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Wise?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Kind?"</p>

<p>"Very kind."</p>

<p>"I should like to see him. I don't
suppose that I intend going to confession,
but I want to talk with such
a man. Has he had much to do with
making you what you are?"</p>

<p>"He has given me good advice,
and I have tried to follow it, if that
is what you mean."</p>

<p>Lady Sackvil looked at Mary fixedly
for some time.</p>

<p>"I made up my mind, a short time
ago," she said, "that the thing most
likely to convince me of the direct
influence of God would be to see
a Christian whose character would
bear scrutiny under the severest test.
I have seen such a Christian in you.
Most women would have spurned me
away in disdain; you have treated me
like a sister. I thank you for it, and
I should like to believe what you believe."</p>

<p>Mary smiled at the reasoning, but
thanked God for the conclusion.
"You would find Padre Giulio very
sympathizing," she said; "I think it
would soothe you to see him. Shall
I send for him to come here?"</p>

<p>"On no account. I will go to him
if you will come with me. Do come
with me; I will bless you all my life,"
she added pleadingly.</p>

<p>"Of course I will go, but not to-day.
If you were to take cold now,
it might be the death of you. To-morrow
morning we will go to St.
Mark's, and I will send him word,
that we may be sure of finding him
at home."</p>

<p>Lady Sackvil looked disappointed.
"I would rather go to-day. I want
to have it over."</p>

<p>"There's no occasion to wish to
have it over," said Mary soothingly.
"An experienced confessor is too well
used to dealing with mental suffering
to wonder at it, no matter in what
shape it comes."</p>

<p>Lady Sackvil lay with her eyes
shut a long time. At last she said,
"I've not been much of a Bible
reader, but I remember well that it
required only the sight of one miracle
to convert sinners in those days. I
suppose sinners are very much the
same in the nineteenth century that
they were in the first."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Mary, and waited
to hear more.</p>

<p>"Your conduct toward me is, in
my opinion, a greater miracle than
the raising of the dead. Nothing but
supernatural strength could have sustained
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I have done any thing remarkable,
it has certainly been God's doing,
not mine."</p>

<p>Lady Sackvil lay still some time
longer. Then she said abruptly,
"I am clever, I know, but I am
not intellectual; and intellectual satisfaction
is not what I demand in
order to become a Christian. If
you were to lay before me all the
tomes of all the theologians, they
would not convey to my mind one
single definite idea."</p>

<p>"You were educated a Catholic,
weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, after a fashion. I was carefully
prepared for confirmation in a
convent school, where I spent six
months, while my aunt was in Europe."</p>

<p>"Then you feel more inclined toward
Catholicity than to any other
form of religion?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. If I am going to be
good, I mean to be decidedly so.
The church demands more than
any sect, and I respect her for that
reason. Like St. Christopher, I wish
to serve the strongest master. Then,
too, the teaching at the convent made
a deeper impression on me than I supposed;
and now that I need support,
it all comes back to me. Last, and
not least, I wish to believe as you
do. You are the best Christian I
have ever seen."</p>

<p>"Your experience in Christians
must have been limited, I think,"
said Mary, smiling.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but I am quite satisfied
to have you for my standard.
Why, are you going? Oh! please
don't leave me. I can't bear to be
alone."</p>

<p>"I must go now. I will come to-morrow
at eleven o'clock, and if you
feel equal to the effort, we will go to
San Marco."</p>

<p>"I shall feel equal to it physically,"
said Lady Sackvil. "It's very provoking.
I meant to have a brain-fever
and die, and I feel better every
minute. I wish you had not come to
take care of me."</p>

<p>"This is the beginning of your
heroic virtue, I suppose," said Mary;
"these are the first fruits of conversion.
Good-by, neophyte! Disturb
yourself about nothing; remember
only that God loves us with a love
too deep to be fathomed."</p>

<p>And then she went home, and sat
down by the ashes that Lady Sackvil
had left on her domestic hearth.</p>


<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p>In the morning, she found Lady
Sackvil taking breakfast in her own
room, looking pale and worn from
the effects of reaction from fever and
excitement. "How do you feel?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Horribly cross. I think all other
sensations are merged in ill-temper."</p>

<p>"A certain sign of convalescence.
I am glad to see it."</p>

<p>Amelia laid down her egg-spoon,
and sank back in her chair. "I
wish," she remarked, "that it had
pleased Heaven to make some variety
in the shape of hen's eggs. I
am so tired of seeing them always
oval."</p>

<p>"You don't want any of these
things, do you?" asked Mary, surveying
the rather solid repast on
the table.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I can't bear the sight of it,"
said Amelia wearily.</p>

<p>"Rest on the couch until I come
back." And Mary arranged the cushions
with a skilful hand, and left the
room noiselessly.</p>

<p>Presently she returned, bearing on
a pretty little tray a glass filled with
some frothy preparation, and two
transparent wafers. Amelia revived
at the sight. "I have dreamed of
such things," she said. "This is the
very apotheosis of breakfast!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<h3>XVII.</h3>

<p>Mary left Lady Sackvil with Padre
Giulio, and went into the church to
pray for the happy result of the interview.
She had passed some time at
the Lady chapel, with its brazen gates
and oriental lamps, and before the
jewel-incrusted high altar, and was
kneeling in the chapel of the Blessed
Sacrament, when she heard the door
of the confessional behind her open.
She looked round. Padre Giulio had
entered the confessional; Lady Sackvil
was kneeling at the grating.</p>

<p>She was sitting within the railing
of the chapel when Amelia joined
her. Mary looked at the beautiful
creature; there was a peaceful smile
on her lips, a holy light in her eyes;
the pride, the caprice, the egotism
were not there; she looked like a
penitent child.</p>

<p>As they passed through one of the
sombre side aisles, Amelia paused before
the crucifix hanging on the wall.
"I have confessed my sins and received
absolution," she said; "are
you willing to kiss me?"</p>

<p>And so the sign of peace was exchanged
before the image of the great
reconciler; and they passed out from
the shadows of those grand old arches
into the sunshine of the Piazza.</p>

<h2>THE IRON MASK.</h2>


<p>Through an oversight, the article
on the Iron Mask in our March number,
which had been lying on hand
several months, was sent to the printer
without its necessary complement,
which we now publish.</p>

<p>In January, 1869, it was announced
in the <cite>Moniteur Universel</cite> that M.
Marius Topin, a young author who had
already distinguished himself by a work
of remarkable historical research, had
succeeded, by dint of laborious examination
and the intelligent study of
a mass of old official documents, in
unearthing the secret of that sphinx
of history&mdash;the Man with the Iron
Mask.</p>

<p>M. Topin did not at once make
known the result of what he claimed
to be his entirely triumphant solution
of the enigma, and publish his work
in book form. He doubtless reflected
that, as the world had waited in patient
expectation more than a hundred and
fifty years for the revelation of the
mystery, it might readily summon up
sufficient resignation to wait a few
months longer. He accordingly announced
that the successive chapters
of his work would appear from time
to time in <cite>Le Correspondant</cite>, a highly
respectable Paris semi-monthly. The
first number of his series was published
on the 25th of February, 1869, and
the last, making seven in all, on the
11th of November. We have received,
as they appeared, all the numbers
of the <cite>Correspondant</cite>, and are therefore
enabled to present from the author's
own articles the following statement of
the result of what he has written.</p>

<p>M. Topin could not deny himself
that universal enjoyment of the story-teller&mdash;to
hold his auditors in suspense
and on tiptoe of expectation by proposing
a varied succession of solutions
of the mystery in hand, and dismissing
them in turn with a&mdash;"Well, that's not
it." He takes up, one after the other,
the various <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prÃ©tendants</i> to the honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of the Iron Mask's living martyrdom,
discusses all the claims in their favor,
presents the objections, demonstrates
that their position is untenable, orders
them off the stage, and passes on to
the next; thus successively eliminating
them until he reaches his objective
point.</p>

<p>M. Topin's first article is preceded
by a sort of device, or motto, in the
shape of a short extract from an order
of Louis XIV.: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faudra que personne
ne sache ce que cet homme sera devenu</i>,
(no one must know what has become
of this man.) It was noticed that the
date of the order is not given. The
article opens with a statement of the
arrival of M. Saint Mars at the Bastille
(Paris) at three <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, on the 18th
of September, 1698. St. Mars was
the newly-appointed governor of that
prison, and came accompanied by a
prisoner whose face was concealed by
a mask of black velvet. This prisoner
died, and was buried on the 20th of
November, 1703, under the name of
Marchialy. The extraordinary precautions
taken after the death of Marchialy
are narrated in our previous
number. The dates above given are
important in determining the claims
of other candidates, inasmuch as the
facts and dates connected with the arrival,
death, and burial of a masked
prisoner at the Bastille are established
beyond controversy by official documents,
and must be considered in any
case presented.</p>

<p>Our author then dilates upon the
difficulties of the question, the fact
that it has been unsuccessfully treated
by fifty-two authors, and finally abandoned
as hopeless by historians like
Michelet, with the conclusion that the
problem of the Man with the Iron
Mask will never be solved. Betraying
no anxiety whatever to make haste,
M. Topin then discusses the merits
of several of the most prominent
theories and the manner in which they
have been presented. The claim that
longest held its ground, and enlisted
in its advocacy the greatest number of
writers, was that made for a supposed
and, as has been shown, entirely imaginary
twin-brother of Louis XIV.,
the son of Anne of Austria, wife of
Louis XIII. It is easy to understand
why, in France, such a version as this
should be the favorite one. It possessed
every possible element of popularity,
intrigue, mystery, illegitimacy,
crime, a rightful heir defrauded of
his throne, and the association of illustrious
names. All these lent their
fascinations; and from Voltaire to
Alexander Dumas, from the <cite>Dictionnaire
Philosophique</cite> to the <i>Vicomte de
Bragelonne</i>, all the resources of writers
of their tendency and calibre were
called into play to give it currency.</p>

<p>M. Topin devotes nearly the whole
of his first article to the demonstration
of the fact that the prisoner of the
Iron Mask was not and could not
have been a son of Anne of Austria.
The discussion is thorough, and the
demonstration complete. Outside of
the question of the Mask one good result
is thus obtained. The innocence
of Anne of Austria is fully established.</p>

<p>Time brings roses&mdash;and justice.
Marie Antoinette was first vindicated
from the foul aspersions of the "progeny
of Voltaire." Now, Anne of
Austria is acquitted; and going further
back in time&mdash;the most distant case
being, of course, the most difficult&mdash;next
comes the turn of Mary Stuart,
and her day, we believe, is not far
distant.</p>

<p>The claim made for the Count of
Vermandois, a son of Louis XIV. and
Louise de la ValliÃ¨re, is next taken
up. As all the details of the last illness,
death, and burial of the Count
of Vermandois are matters of profuse
official record, M. Topin has very little
trouble in disposing of this case.
Then we have the Duke of Monmouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a natural son of Charles II. of England.
Defeated at the battle of Sedgemoor,
where the forces under his command
were arrayed in armed rebellion
against James II., and afterward
taken prisoner, he was beheaded in
the Tower of London July 15th, 1685.
The dispatches of various foreign ministers
in London at the time fully establish
the fact of his death.</p>

<p>To Monmouth succeeds Francis of
VendÃ´me, Duke of Beaufort. As grand
admiral of France, Beaufort commanded
the naval expedition sent out
to aid the Venetians in their defence
of Candia against the Turks in 1669.
As in the cases of the two sons of
Louis XIV., and Monmouth, the surrounding
circumstances give M. Topin
the fullest opportunity of indulging
in court anecdotes, intrigues, and
festivities, mingled with biographical
sketches of distinguished personages,
so in the case of Beaufort, his history
warrants our author in going into all
the details of the siege and military
and naval operations against the army
of the sultan. Beaufort is believed to
have been killed in an attack upon
the enemy's works, and was last seen
in the thickest of a hand-to-hand
struggle in the intrenchments. As
his body was never recovered, this
fact gave the mystery-mongers an advantageous
margin. But Beaufort
was born in 1616, and the Iron Mask
was buried in 1703. Supposing him
to be the "Mask," this would make
him eighty-seven years old at his
death, which, of itself, puts him out of
the question.</p>

<p>In his third number, M. Topin introduces
the so-called Armenian Patriarch,
<i>Avedick</i>. Why he did so is
best known to himself; for the case of
Avedick has never been presented as
one that would give him any right to
rank among the claimants for the distinction
of the Iron Mask. Taules,
and the German historian Hammer,
are referred to as authorities for Avedick's
claim; but on being examined,
they are found totally insufficient as
warrants for such a theory. The essential
pivot of the question of identity
of the Iron Mask is the death and
burial of its wearer in 1703. Now,
Avedick was still in Turkey in 1706,
and that settles his claim beyond question.
Avedick was seized by order
of the Marquis of Ferriol in the Grecian
Archipelago, May, 1706, carried
forcibly to France, retained in confinement
in various places until September,
1710, when he was liberated.
He died in Paris in July, 1711. This
was most certainly a case of shameful
violation of the law of nations, of
power, and of humanity. A case of
abominable personal cruelty it also
certainly was&mdash;but it was not a case
of "Iron Mask." Two such outrages
as those on the persons of Marchialy
and Avedick are quite enough of
themselves; to say nothing of certain
diplomatic arrangements with the
Grand Turk which endangered Christianity
and the public peace in Europe&mdash;to
settle one's opinion as to the genuineness
of the glories of the reign of
Louis XIV., a Grand Monarque who
was not great.</p>

<p>But to return, M. Topin's chapter
on the Avedick case, appearing in <cite>Le
Correspondant</cite> of the 10th June, 1869,
was followed by an article from the
pen of Rev. Father Turquand, S.J.,
in the September (10th) number of
the same periodical, severely attacking
the statements of Avedick's case
by M. Topin, and vindicating his
(Turquand's) society from certain imputations
cast upon it in connection
with the seizure of Avedick.</p>

<p>In his fourth number, (Oct. 10th,)
M. Topin takes up the claim made
for Fouquet, whose case differs from
all the others in the fact that he was a
prisoner of state by sentence of a judicial
tribunal. Fouquet's claims were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
warmly pressed by a very able literary
advocate, Paul Lacroix, (Bibliophile
Jacob,) in a work published in 1830.
But here again the difficulty of dates
is insurmountable. Fouquet died in
1680, and there is no proof of the
appearance of the Man with the Iron
Mask until after that period.</p>

<p>We pass on to another. In the
year 1677, the Duke of Mantua was
Charles IV. of the illustrious house
of Gonzaga. He was young, careless,
dissipated, and extravagant. Spending
most of his time in Venice, he seldom
visited his duchy, except for the purpose
of raising money. He gradually
fell into the hands of usurious lenders,
and continued to obtain the sums he
wanted by anticipating, through them,
the receipt of the taxes and imposts
of his duchy by several years. The
Marquisate of Montferrat was among
his dependencies. Its little capital,
Casal, a fortified place on the Po,
fifteen leagues east of Turin, was a
point of great strategic importance,
and essential to the safety of Piedmont.
The court of Turin would
not, of course, consent to its possession
by France. But to France it
was of the highest value, as with
Pignerol and Casal it would be master
of the situation. This place Louis
XIV. wanted to buy, and Charles IV.
was perfectly willing to sell it. Ercolo
(Hercules) Antonio Mattioli, a
young nobleman of the court of
Mantua, at this time thirty-seven
years of age, was high in favor with
the reigning duke. Through Giuliani,
an Italian journalist, D'Estrades,
Louis XIV.'s ambassador at Venice,
sounded Mattioli, and finally, through
him, succeeded in opening a negotiation
with the duke for the sale of
Casal to France.</p>

<p>All three met at Venice in March,
1678, discussed terms, and agreed
upon one hundred thousand crowns
as the price of the cession. Mattioli
then went to Paris to sign the treaty
in the name of his master the duke.
The treaty was completed in December,
1678, and after its signature, Mattioli
was received by Louis XIV. in
secret audience, presented by the
king with a rich diamond ring and
four hundred double <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis d'or</i>, with
the promise of a far greater amount
of money, the appointment of his son
among the royal pages, and a valuable
endowment for his mother. The intrigue
and negotiation had been admirably
managed and crowned with
perfect success. Of all who had any
interest opposed to the French possession
of Casal, not one had the
slightest suspicion, and it would have
been difficult to imagine the existence
of the smallest element of failure in
the enterprise.</p>

<p>But the best-laid schemes of men,
mice, and monarchs here below oft
come to naught. Two months after
Mattioli's visit to Paris, the courts
of Turin, of Madrid, and of Vienna,
the Spanish governor of the Milanese
provinces, and the state inquisitors
of the Venetian republic&mdash;that
is to say, all and every one most
interested against the execution of the
treaty&mdash;not only knew of its existence,
but were fully advised of every detail
concerning it, the names of the negotiators,
the date of the instruments,
the price of cession, when it was to be
made, etc. In short, they knew every
thing concerning it. Well they might.
Mattioli himself had told them! His
motive is a subject of dispute. One
theory is, interested motive; another,
patriotism. Certain it is he had more
to gain&mdash;as a mere question of interest&mdash;by
keeping than by betraying
the secret. On this point, though, we
do not undertake to judge him. In
February, 1679, the Duchess of Savoy
advised Louis XIV. that she was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
possession of Mattioli's information.
The disappointment, the mortification,
and the anger of the French king can
easily be imagined. He was placed
in a position not only dangerous; but
what was almost worse, ludicrous.
Mattioli had the king's signature to
the treaty in his possession, and it was
all-important to recover it. The king
in Paris, and his minister D'Estrades,
both conceived the same idea for
remedy in the matter. On the 28th
of April, 1679, Louis sent the order
to have Mattioli arrested, and on arrival
of the order, Mattioli had already
(May 2d) been carried off a prisoner.
D'Estrades had managed to decoy
him across the frontier, at a point
where he had a detachment of dragoons
waiting, and in a few hours
the Italian was a prisoner at Pignerol,
the commencement of a captivity that
was to endure four and twenty long
years. M. Topin then continues the
discussion of Mattioli's case, and
closes the article, leaving the reader
under the impression that he decides
against the claim of Mattioli.</p>

<p>Indeed he goes further; for he more
than intimates that there is very little
probability of ever penetrating the
mystery surrounding the Man with
the Iron Mask.</p>

<p>The case made for Mattioli has
always been the strongest, even before
the publication of the work of
Mr. J. Delort, which was mostly appropriated
by Ellis in his <cite>True History
of the State Prisoner</cite>. Mr.
Loiseleur has also discussed the Mattioli
claim with great force; so successfully,
indeed, that a very large
number of critical scholars were satisfied
with his adverse demonstration.</p>

<p>M. Topin discusses at great length
the facts and the reasoning of Mr.
Loiseleur, and, as we have just stated,
concludes his sixth article by a decision
against Mattioli. But in his concluding
chapter (<cite>Correspondant</cite>, Nov.
10th) he comes to a right-about face,
takes up some of Mr. Loiseleur's
proofs, adds some new dispatches,
and decides that&mdash;Mattioli is the
French prisoner of state known as
the Man with the Iron Mask.</p>

<p>We fear that after all the solution
of M. Topin is no solution, and that
the only result of his labor is to narrow
the discussion down to the claims
of Mattioli and another prisoner of
unknown name.</p>

<h2>THE SCHOOL QUESTION.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h2>


<p>The number of <cite>The Christian
World</cite>, the organ of the American
and Foreign Christian Union, for February
last is entirely taken up with
the school question, and professes to
give "a carefully digested summary
of the views and reasonings of all parties
to the controversy." The views
and reasonings of the Catholic party
are not misstated, but are very inadequately
presented; those of the
other parties are given more fully,
and, we presume, as correctly and
as authoritatively as possible. The
number does not dispose of the subject;
but furnishes us a fitting occasion
to make some observations which
will at least set forth correctly our
views of the school question as Catholics
and American citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>It is to the credit of the American
people that they have, at least the
Calvinistic portion of them, from the
earliest colonial times, taken a deep
interest in the education of the young,
and made considerable sacrifices to
secure it. The American Congregationalists
and Presbyterians, who were
the only original settlers of the eastern
and middle colonies, have from
the first taken the lead in education,
and founded, sustained, and conducted
most of our institutions of learning.
The Episcopalians, following the Anglican
Church, have never taken much
interest in the education of the people,
having been chiefly solicitous
about the higher class of schools and
seminaries. The Baptists and Methodists
have, until recently, been
quite indifferent to education. They
have now some respectable schools;
but the writer of this was accustomed
in his youth to hear both Baptists
and Methodists preach against college-bred
parsons, and a <i>larned</i> ministry.
In those States which had as colonies
proprietary governments, and in which
the Episcopalians, Baptists, and Methodists
have predominated, universal
education has been, and still is, more
or less neglected. Even the Presbyterians,
while they have insisted on a
learned ministry and the education
of the easy classes, have not insisted
so earnestly on the education of the
children of all classes as have the
Congregationalists; and, indeed, it is
hardly too much to say that our present
system of common schools at
the public expense owes its origin to
Congregationalists and the influence
they have exerted. The system,
whatever may be thought of it, has
undeniably had a religious, not a secular
origin.</p>

<p>The system originated in New
England; strictly speaking, in Massachusetts.
As originally established
in Massachusetts, it was simply a
system of parochial schools. The
parish and the town were coincident,
and the schools of the several school-districts
into which the parish was divided
were supported by a tax on the
population and property of the town,
levied according to the grand list or
state assessment roll. The parish, at
its annual town meeting, voted the
amount of money it would raise for
schools during the ensuing year, which
was collected by the town collector,
and expended under the direction of
a school committee chosen at the
same meeting. Substantially the same
system was adopted and followed
in New Hampshire and Connecticut.
In Vermont, the towns were divided
or divisible, under a general law, into
school-districts, and each school-district
decided for itself the amount of
money it would raise for its school,
and the mode of raising it. It might
raise it by tax levied on the property
of the district, or, as it was said, on
"the grand list," or <i>per capita</i> on the
scholars attending and according to
the length of their attendance. In
this latter method, which was generally
followed, only those who used
the schools were taxed to support
them. This latter method was, in its
essential features, adopted in all, or
nearly all, the other States that had
a common school system established
by law. In Rhode Island and most
of the Southern States, the inhabitants
were left to their own discretion, to
have schools or not as they saw proper,
and those who wanted them
founded and supported them at their
own expense. In none of the States,
however, was there developed at first
a system of free public schools supported
either by a school fund or by a
general tax on property levied by the
State, though Massachusetts contained
such a system in germ.</p>

<p>Gradually, from the proceeds of
public lands, from lots of land reserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in each township, especially in the
new States, for common schools, and
from various other sources, several of
the States accumulated a school fund,
the income of which, in some instances,
sufficed, or nearly sufficed, for the
support of free public schools for all
the children in the State. This gave
a new impulse to the movement for
free schools and universal education,
or schools founded and supported
for all the children of the State at the
public expense in whole or in part,
either from the income of the school
fund or by a public tax. This is not
yet carried out universally, but is that
to which public sentiment in all the
States is tending; and now that slavery
is abolished, and the necessity of educating
the freedmen is deeply felt,
there can be little doubt that it will
soon become the policy of every State
in the Union.</p>

<p>The schools were originally founded
by a religious people for a religious
end, not by seculars for a purely secular
end. The people at so early a
day had not advanced so far as they
have now, and did not dream of
divorcing secular education from religion.
The schools were intended
to give both religious and secular
education in their natural union, and
there was no thought of the feasibility
of separating what God had joined
together. The Bible was read as a
class-book, the catechism was taught
as a regular school exercise, and the
pastor of the parish visited the schools
and instructed them in religion as
often as he saw proper. Indeed, he
was, it might be said, <i>ex officio</i> the
superintendent of the parish schools;
and whether he was chosen as committee-man
or not, his voice was all
potent in the management of the
school, in the selection of studies, and
in the appointment and dismissal of
teachers. The superiority in a religious
and moral point of view to the
schools as now developed may be
seen by contrasting the present moral
and religious state of New England
with what it was then.</p>

<p>The religion, as we Catholics hold,
was defective, and even false; but the
principle on which the schools were
founded was sound, and worked well
in the beginning, did no injustice to
any one, and violated no conscience;
for Congregationalism was the established
religion, and the people were
all Congregationalists. Even where
there was no established religion and
different denominations obtained, conscience
was respected; for the character
of the school, as well as the religion
taught in it, was determined by
the inhabitants of the school district,
and nobody was obliged to send his
children to it, and those only who
did send were taxed for its support.</p>

<p>But in none of the States is there
now an established religion, and in
all there are a great variety of denominations,
all invested with equal
rights before the state. It is obvious,
then, the Massachusetts system cannot
in any of them be adopted or
continued, and the other system of
taxing only those who use the schools
cannot be maintained, if the schools
are to be supported from the income
of public funds, or by a public tax
levied alike on the whole population
of the district, town, municipality, or
State. Here commences the difficulty&mdash;and
a grave one it is, too&mdash;which
has as yet received no practical solution,
and which the legislatures of the
several States are now called upon to
solve.</p>

<p>Hitherto the attempt has been
made to meet the difficulty by excluding
from the public schools what the
state calls sectarianism&mdash;that is, whatever
is distinctive of any particular
denomination or peculiar to it&mdash;and
allowing to be introduced only what
is common to all, or, as it is called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
"our common Christianity." This
would, perhaps, meet the difficulty, if
the several denominations were only
different varieties of Protestantism.
The several Protestant denominations
differ from one another only in details
or particulars, which can easily be supplied
at home in the family, or in the
Sunday-school. But this solution is
impracticable where the division is
not one between Protestant sects only,
but between Catholics and Protestants.
The difference between Catholics
and Protestants is not a difference
in details or particulars only, but a
difference in principle. Catholicity
must be taught as a whole, in its unity
and its integrity, or it is not taught
at all. It must everywhere be all or
nothing. It is not a simple theory
of truth or a collection of doctrines;
it is an organism, a living body, living
and operating from its own central life,
and is necessarily one and indivisible,
and cannot have any thing in common
with any other body. To exclude
from the schools all that is distinctive
or peculiar in Catholicity, is simply
to exclude Catholicity itself, and to
make the schools either purely Protestant
or purely secular, and therefore
hostile to our religion, and such
as we cannot in conscience support.</p>

<p>Yet this is the system adopted, and
while the law enables non-Catholics
to use the public schools with the
approbation of their consciences, it
excludes the children of Catholics,
unless their parents are willing to violate
their Catholic conscience, to neglect
their duty as fathers and mothers,
and expose their children to
the danger of losing their faith, and
with it the chance of salvation. We
are not free to expose our children to
so great a danger, and are bound in
conscience to do all in our power to
guard them against it, and to bring
them up in the faith of the church, to
be good and exemplary Catholics.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, the rule of allowing
only our supposed "common
Christianity" to be taught in schools
does not solve the difficulty, or secure
to the Catholic his freedom of conscience.</p>

<p>The exclusion of the Bible would
not help the matter. This would
only make the schools purely secular,
which were worse than making
them purely Protestant; for, as it regards
the state, society, morality, all
the interests of this world, Protestantism
we hold to be far better than no
religion&mdash;unless you include under
its name free-lovism, free-religion,
woman's-rightsism, and the various
other similar <i>isms</i> struggling to get
themselves recognized and adopted,
and to which the more respectable
Protestants, we presume, are hardly
less opposed than we are. If some
Catholics in particular localities have
supposed that the exclusion of the
Protestant Bible from the public
schools would remove the objection
to them as schools for Catholic children,
they have, in our opinion, fallen
into a very great mistake. The question
lies deeper than reading or not
reading the Bible in the schools, in
one version or another. Of course,
our church disapproves the Protestant
version of the Bible, as a faulty
translation of a mutilated text; but
its exclusion from the public schools
would by no means remove our objections
to them. We object to them
not merely because they teach more
or less of the Protestant religion, but
also on the ground that we cannot
freely and fully teach our religion and
train up our children in them to be
true and unwavering Catholics; and
we deny the right of the State, the
city, the town, or the school district,
to tax us for schools in which we are
not free to do so.</p>

<p>We value education, and even universal
education&mdash;which overlooks no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
class or child, however rich or however
poor, however honored or however
despised&mdash;as highly as any of
our countrymen do or can; but we
value no education that is divorced
from religion and religious culture.
Religion is the supreme law, the one
thing to be lived for; and all in life,
individual or social, civil or political,
should be subordinated to it, and esteemed
only as means to the eternal end
for which man was created and exists.
Religious education is the chief thing,
and we wish our children to be accustomed,
from the first dawning of reason,
so to regard it, and to regard
whatever they learn or do as having
a bearing on their religious character
or their duty to God. Mr. Bulwer&mdash;now
Lord Lytton&mdash;as well as
many other literary men of eminence,
have written much on the danger of
a purely intellectual culture, or of the
education of the intellect divorced
from that of the heart, or sentiments
and affections. We hold that education,
either of the intellect or of the
heart, or of both combined, divorced
from faith and religious discipline, is
dangerous alike to the individual and
to society. All education should be
religious, and intended to train the
child for a religious end; not for this
life only, but for eternal life; for this
life is nothing if severed from that
which is to come.</p>

<p>Even for this world, for civilization
itself, the religious education which
the church gives is far better than any
so-called secular education without it.
The church has not always been able
to secure universal secular education
for all her children; but there can be
no question that the illiterate classes
of Catholic nations are far more civilized
and better trained than are
the corresponding classes of Protestant
nations. There is no comparison
in personal dignity, manliness, self-respect,
courtesy of manner, refined
feeling, and delicate sentiment, between
an unlettered Italian, French,
Spanish, or Irish peasant, and an unlettered
Protestant German, English,
or American. The one is a cultivated,
a civilized man; the other is a boor, a
clown, coarse and brutal, who perpetually
mistakes impudence for independence,
and proves his self-respect
by his indifference or insults to others.
The difference is due to the difference
of religion and religious culture;
not, as is sometimes pretended,
to difference of race. The church civilizes
the whole nation that accepts
her; only the upper classes in Protestant
nations are civilized.</p>

<p>Of course, we do not and can not
expect, in a state where Protestants
have equal rights with Catholics before
the state, to carry our religion
into public schools designed equally
for all. We have no right to do it.
But Protestants have no more right
to carry their religion into them than
we have to carry ours; and carry
theirs they do, when ours is excluded.
Their rights are equal to ours, and
ours are equal to theirs; and neither
does nor can, in the eyes of the state,
override the other. As the question
is a matter of conscience, and therefore
of the rights of God, there can
be no compromise, no splitting of
differences, or yielding of the one
party to the other. Here comes up
the precise difficulty. The state is
bound equally to recognize and respect
the conscience of Protestants
and of Catholics, and has no right
to restrain the conscience of either.
There must, then, be a dead-lock, unless
some method can be discovered
or devised by which the public schools
can be saved without lesion either to
the Protestant or the Catholic.</p>

<p>Three solutions have been suggested:
1. The first is to exclude the
Bible and all religious teaching, or
recognition, in any way, shape, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
manner, of religion, from the public
schools. This is the infidel or secular
solution, and, so far as Catholics
are concerned, is no solution at all.
It is simple mockery. What we demand
is, not that religion be excluded
from the schools, but schools in which
we can teach freely and fully our own
religion to our own children. It is
precisely these purely secular schools,
in which all education is divorced
from religion&mdash;from the faith, precepts,
services, and discipline of the
church, as well as education combined
with a false religion&mdash;that we
oppose. Nor will this solution satisfy
the more respectable Protestant denominations,
as is evident from the tenacity
with which they insist on reading
the Bible in the schools. They do
not believe any more than we do in
the utility, or even practicability, of
divorcing what is called secular learning
from religion. All education, they
hold, as well as we, that is not religious,
is necessarily anti-religious.
This is a case in which there is and
can be no neutrality. We find this
conclusively shown by some remarks
in <cite>The Christian World</cite> before us, credited
to Professor Tayler Lewis, the
most learned and able thinker we are
acquainted with among our Protestant
contemporaries. The professor's remarks
are so true, so sensible, and so
much to our purpose, that, though not
so brief as we could wish, our readers
will hardly fail to thank us for transcribing
them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let us test this specious plea of neutrality.
What does it imply? If carried
strictly out to the exclusion of every thing
religious, or having a religious tendency, it
must consistently demand a like exclusion
of every thing that in the least manifests the
opposite tendency, under whatever specious
disguises it may be veiled. It does not alter
the case in the least that opinions, regarded
as irreligious, or as undermining or
in any way weakening the grounds of belief,
take to themselves the specious names of
literature, or politics, or political economy,
or phrenology, or the philosophy of history.
No such sham pass-words should give
to Buckle and Combe admittance where Butler
and Chalmers are shut out. Every thing
that makes it less easy for the child to believe
his catechism, 'taught at home,' as
they say, is a break of the supposed concordat.
The mere objection is to be heeded.
It is enough that things seem so to serious
men, as capable of correct reasoning
as any on the other side; or that it is the
opinion, the prejudice, if any choose so to
call it, of a devout ignorance. The thoughtful
religious man might be willing to forego
his objection if there were or could be real
impartiality. He might trust a true moral
and religious training as fully able to counteract
any thing of an opposite tendency.
But to let in the enemy, and then take away
the weapon of defence&mdash;this is a neutrality
hard to be understood.</p>

<p>"Now, there can be no doubt of the fact
that there is admitted into our schools, our
colleges, our educational libraries, into the
reading-rooms connected with them, much
that is thus <em>deemed</em> irreligious in its tendency&mdash;at
least, by the holders of our stricter
creeds. There is much that is silently
alienating the minds of their children from
the doctrines held sacred by their fathers.
We might go further: there is much that
tends to undermine all religious belief, even
of the freest cast. What young man can
have his mind filled with the atheistical speculations
of Mill and Spencer, or be exposed
to the uncounteracted theories of Darwin
and Huxley, and yet retain unimpaired his
belief in a providence as taught by Christ&mdash;a
providence that 'numbers the very hairs
of our heads'&mdash;or listen as before to the
prayer that ascends from the family altar?
These writers profess a kind of theism, it is
said; but wherein, as far as any moral power
is concerned, does it differ from a belief in
quadratic equations, or the dogmas of heat
and magnetism?</p>

<p>"The matter, as we have stated it, would
be too plain for argument were it not for
those magical words, <i>secular</i> and <i>sectarian</i>,
that some are so fond of using. 'The state
knows no religion,' they say; it is wholly 'a
private concern' between the <em>individual</em> and
his Maker. 'The state knows no God.'
They wonder the zealous bigot cannot see
how clear this makes every thing. If he
would only assent to propositions so easy,
so self-evident, we should have peace. But
set these confident logicians to define what
they mean by terms so fluently employed,
or ask them to show us how the state can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
keep clear of all action, direct or indirect,
for or against an interest so vital as religion,
so all-pervading, so intimately affecting every
other, and how soon they begin to stammer!
What is secular? The one who attempts to
define it would perhaps begin with a negative.
It is that which has no connection
with religion; no aspects, no relations, no
tendencies, no suggestions, beyond this
world, or, the narrowest view of it, this
<i>age</i> or <i>seculum</i>. Now, let him apply it to
particular branches of education. There is
the learning of the alphabet, spelling, reading.
But what shall the child read? It
would be very difficult to find a mere reading-book&mdash;unless
its contents were an empty
gabble, like the nonsense Latin verses of
some schools&mdash;that would not somewhere,
and in some way, betray moral or immoral,
religious or irreligious ideas, according to
the judgment of some minds. But let us
waive this, and go on. Arithmetic is secular.
Geography is secular; though we have
seen things under the head of physical geography
that some classes of religionists might
object to as betraying a spirit hostile to the
idea of the earth's creation in any form. But
go on. Including the pure mathematics, as
being pure mathematics and nothing else,
we have about got to the end of our definition.
No thinking man would pretend that
the departments of life and motion, chemistry,
dynamics, physiology, could be studied
apart from a higher class of ideas. But secularity
would interfere here in a very strange
way. When these roads of knowledge thus
tend upward toward the eternal light, it
would shut down the gate and eject the
book. Natural philosophy, as taught by
Newton and Kepler, gets beyond secularity.
When, on the other hand, after the manner
of Humboldt, Lamarck, and Darwin, its
progress is in the direction of the eternal
darkness, the study of it becomes entirely
<i>unsectarian</i>; it violates no rights of conscience!</p>

<p>"In other departments, it is still more
difficult to set the secular bound. History,
the philosophy of history, political philosophy,
psychology, ethics, however strong the
effort to dereligionize them, do all, when
left to their proper expansion, spurn any
such bounds. Art, too, when wholly secularized;
poetry stripped of its religious
ideality; how long would they resist such
a narrowing, suffocating process? A lower
dogma was never maintained than this of a
wholly secular education, or one more utterly
<em>impracticable</em>. The subject must inevitably
die under the operation, and religion
must come back again into our schools and
colleges, to save them from inanity and extinction.</p>

<p>"There may be stated here some reasons
why this plea of neutrality, though so false,
is yet so specious and misleading. It arises
from the fact that the statement of moral,
religious, and theological ideas demands
clear and positive language. The hostile
forms, on the other hand, are disguised under
vague and endlessly varying negations.
They are Protean, too, in their appellations.
They take to themselves the names of literature,
art, philosophy, reform. This procedure
shows itself in reading-books intended
for our primary schools; in text-books
prepared for the higher institutions; in essays
and periodicals that strew the tables of
reading-rooms attached to our colleges and
academies; and, above all, in the public lecturing,
male and female, which may be said
to have become a part of our educational
system. For example, should the writer of
this attempt to explain before such an audience
'the doctrines of grace,' as they are
called, or that unearthly system of ideas
which can be traced through the whole line
of the church&mdash;patristic, Roman, and Protestant&mdash;in
their production of a strong unearthly
character, then would be immediately
heard the cry of bigotry, or the senseless
yell of church and state. And now for the
<em>opposing</em> 'dogmas,' as they really are, notwithstanding
all their disguises. They make
their entrance under endlessly varied forms.
Pantheism has free admittance; but that is
not dogmatic&mdash;it calls itself philosophy. In
some lecture on progress, or history, the
most essential of these old 'doctrines of
grace' may be sneeringly ignored or covertly
assailed; but that is literature. Darwinism
is expounded, with its virtual denial
of any thing like creation; or Huxleyism,
which brings man out of the monkey, and
the monkey out of the fungus; that is science.
Or it may be the whining nonsense
which glorifies the nineteenth century at the
expense of the far honester eighteenth, and
talks so undogmatically of the deep 'yearning'
for something better&mdash;that is, the 'coming
faith.' And so goes on this exhibition
of impartiality, with its exclusion of every
thing dogmatic and theological."</p></blockquote>

<p>Neither Catholics nor Protestants
who believe at all in religion will
consent to be taxed to support infidel,
pantheistic, or atheistic education;
and all so-called purely secular education
is really nothing else. The
temporal separated from the eternal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the universe from its Creator, is nothing,
and can be no object of science.
The first suggested solution must then
be abandoned, and not be entertained
for a moment by the state, unless it is
bent on suicide; for the basis of the
state itself is religion, and is excluded
in excluding all religious ideas and
principles.</p>

<p>2. The second solution suggested
is to adopt in education the voluntary
system, as we do in religion, and
leave each denomination to maintain
schools for its own children at its own
expense. We could accept this solution,
as Catholics, without any serious
objection; but we foresee some trouble
in disposing of the educational
funds held by several of the States in
trust for common schools, academies,
and colleges, and in determining to
whom shall belong the school-houses,
and academy and college buildings
and fixtures, erected, in whole or in
part, at the public expense. Besides,
this would break up the whole public
school system, and defeat the chief
end it contemplates&mdash;that of providing
a good common education for
all the children of the land, especially
the children of the poorer classes.
Catholics, Presbyterians, Congregationalists,
and Episcopalians would
establish and support schools, each
respectively for their own children;
but some other denominations might
not, and the infidels, and that large
class called <i>nothingarian</i>, most certainly
would not. Only they who
believe in some religion see enough
of dignity in man, or worth in the
human soul, to make the sacrifice of
a penny for education. The Darwins,
the Huxleys, the Lyells, and other
unbelieving scientists of the day, were
never educated in schools, academies,
colleges, or universities founded by infidels.
They graduated from schools
founded by the faith and piety of
those who believed in God, in creation,
in Christ, in the life and immortality
brought to light in the Gospel;
and if they have devoted themselves
to severe studies, it has not been from
love of science, but in the ignoble
hope of being able to dispense, in the
explanation of nature, with God the
Creator, and to prove that man is
only a monkey developed, a condensed
gas, or, as Dr. Cabanis defined
him, simply "a digestive tube open at
both ends."</p>

<p>Moreover, though we deny the
competency of the state to act as
educator, we hold that its duty toward
both religion and education is
something more than negative. We
hold that it has positive duties to perform
in regard to each. It cannot
decide what religion its citizens shall
accept and obey; but it is bound to
protect its citizens in the free and full
enjoyment of the religion they adopt
for themselves. We cannot, for the
sake of carrying a point which we
hold to be true and certain to be of
great importance, ally ourselves with
infidels, or lay down as a universal
principle what our church has never
approved, and what we may in the
change of the tide be ourselves
obliged to disavow. The state, with
all its powers and functions, exists for
religion, and is in all its action subordinated
to the eternal end of man.
As the church teaches, and as the
New England Puritans held, this
world is never the end; it is only a
means to an end infinitely above
itself. We will never dishonor truth
so much as to concede for a moment
that the state is independent of religion;
that it may treat religion, as a
coÃ¶rdinate power with itself, with
indifference, or look down upon it
with haughty contempt, as beneath
its notice, or to be pushed aside if
it comes in its way. It is as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
bound to consult the spiritual end of
man, and to obey the law of God,
which overrides all other laws, as is
the individual.</p>

<p>We, of course, deny the competency
of the state to educate, to say
what shall or shall not be taught in
the public schools, as we deny its
competency to say what shall or shall
not be the religious belief and discipline
of its citizens. We, of course,
utterly repudiate the popular doctrine
that so-called secular education is the
function of the state. Yet, while we
might accept this second solution as
an expedient, we do not approve it,
and cannot defend it as sound in
principle. It would break up and
utterly destroy the free public school
system, what is good as well as what
is evil in it; and we wish to save the
system by simply removing what it
contains repugnant to the Catholic
conscience&mdash;not to destroy it or lessen
its influence. We are decidedly in
favor of free public schools for all the
children of the land, and we hold that
the property of the state should bear
the burden of educating the children
of the state&mdash;the two great and essential
principles of the system, and
which endear it to the hearts of the
American people. Universal suffrage
is a mischievous absurdity without
universal education; and universal
education is not practicable unless
provided for at the public expense.
While, then, we insist that the action
of the state shall be subordinated to
the law of conscience, we yet hold
that it has an important part to perform,
and that it is its duty, in view
of the common weal, and of its own
security as well as that of its citizens,
to provide the means of a good common
school education for all its children,
whatever their condition, rich
or poor, Catholics or Protestants. It
has taken the American people over
two hundred years to arrive at this
conclusion, and never by our advice
shall they abandon it.</p>

<p>3. The first and second solutions
must then be dismissed as unsatisfactory.
The first, because it excludes
religion, and makes the public schools
nurseries of infidelity and irreligion.
The second, because it breaks up and
destroys the whole system of free
public schools, and renders the universal
education demanded by our
institutions impracticable, or unlikely
to be given, and in so far endangers
the safety, the life, and prosperity of
the republic. We repeat it, what we
want is not the destruction of the
system, but simply its modification so
far as necessary to protect the conscience
of both Catholics and Protestants
in its rightful freedom. The
modification necessary to do this is
much slighter than is supposed, and,
instead of destroying or weakening
the system, would really perfect it
and render it alike acceptable to Protestants
and to Catholics, and combine
both in the efforts necessary to
sustain it. It is simply to adopt the
third solution that has been suggested,
namely, that of dividing the schools
between Catholics and Protestants,
and assigning to each the number proportioned
to the number of children
each has to educate. This would
leave Catholics free to teach their religion
and apply their discipline in the
Catholic schools, and Protestants free
to teach their religion and apply their
discipline in the Protestant schools.
The system, as a system of free
schools at the public expense, with
its fixtures and present machinery,
would remain unimpaired; and a religious
education, so necessary to society
as well as to the soul, could be
given freely and fully to all, without
the slightest lesion to any one's conscience,
or interference with the full
and entire religious freedom which
is guaranteed by our constitution to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
every citizen. The Catholic will be
restored to his rights, and the Protestant
will retain his.</p>

<p>This division was not called for in
New England in the beginning; for
then the people were all of one and
the same religion; nor when only
those who used the schools were
taxed for their support. It was not
needed even when there were only
Protestants in the country. In demanding
it now, we cast no censure
on the original founders of our public
schools. But now, when the system
is so enlarged as to include free
schools for all the children of the
state at the public expense, and
Catholics have become and are likely
to remain a notable part of the population
of the country, it becomes not
only practicable, but absolutely necessary,
if religious liberty or freedom
of conscience for all citizens is to be
maintained; and it were an act of injustice
to Catholics, whose conscience
chiefly demands the division, and a
gross abuse of power, to withhold it.
It may be an annoyance to Protestants
that Catholics are here; but they are
here, and here they will remain; and
it is never the part of wisdom to resist
the inevitable. Our population
is divided between Catholics and
Protestants, and the only sensible
course is for each division to recognize
and respect the equal rights of
the other before the State.</p>

<p>One objection of a practical character
has been brought against the
division by the New York <cite>Tribune</cite>.
That journal says that, if the division
could be made in cities and large
towns, it would still be impracticable
in the sparsely settled districts of the
country, where the population is too
small to admit, without too great an
expense, of two separate schools, one
Catholic and one Protestant. The
objection is one that is likely to diminish
in force with time. In such
districts let each school receive its
<i>pro rata</i> amount of the public money:
if too little, let Catholic charity make
up the deficiency for the Catholic,
and Protestant charity for the Protestant
school. Besides, in these
sparsely settled districts there are few
Catholics, and their children are far
less exposed than in cities, large
towns, and villages.</p>

<p>The more common objection urged
is, that if separate schools are conceded
to Catholics, they must not only
be conceded to the Israelites, but
also to each Protestant denomination.
To the Israelites, we grant, if they
demand them. To each Protestant
denomination, not at all, unless each
denomination can put in an honest
plea of conscience for such division.
All Protestant denominations, without
a single exception, unless it be the
Episcopalians, unite in opposing the
division we ask for, and in defending
the system as it is, which proves that
they have no conscientious objections
to the public schools as they are now
constituted and conducted. The division
to meet the demands of the
Catholic conscience would necessitate
no change at all in the schools not
set apart for Catholic children; and
the several denominations that are
not conscientiously opposed to them
now could not be conscientiously
opposed to them after the division.
We cannot suppose that any denomination
of Protestants would consent
to support a system of education that
offends its own conscience for the
sake of doing violence to the conscience
of Catholics. Do not all
American Protestants profess to be
the sturdy champions of freedom of
conscience, and maintain that where
conscience begins there the secular authority
ends? If the present schools
do violence to no Protestant conscience,
as we presume from their defence
of them they do not, no Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
denomination can demand a
division in its favor on the plea of
conscience; and to no other plea is
the state or the public under any
obligation to listen. If, however,
there be any denomination that can
in good faith demand separate schools
on the plea of conscience, we say at
once let it have them, for such a plea,
when honest, overrides every other
consideration.</p>

<p>But we are asked what shall be
done with the large body of citizens
who are neither Catholic nor Protestant?
Such citizens, we reply,
have no religion; and they who have
no religion have no conscience that
people who have religion are bound
to respect. If they refuse to send
their children either to the Hebrew
schools or the Catholic schools, or,
in fine, to the Protestant schools, let
them found schools of their own, at
their own expense. The constitutions
of the several States guarantee to each
and every citizen the right to worship
God according to the dictates of his
own conscience; but this is not guaranteeing
to any one the freedom of
not worshipping God, to deny his existence,
to reject his revelation, or to
worship a false God. The liberty
guaranteed is the liberty of religion,
not the liberty of infidelity. The infidel
has, under our constitution and
laws, the right of protection in his
civil and political equality; but none
to protection in his infidelity, since
that is not a religion, but the denial
of all religion. He cannot plead conscience
in its behalf, for conscience
presupposes religion; and where there
is no religious faith, there is, of course,
no conscience. It would be eminently
absurd to ask the state to protect
infidelity, or the denial of all religion;
for religion, as we have said,
is the only basis of the state, and for
the state to protect infidelity would
be to cut its own throat.</p>

<p>These are, we believe, all the plausible
objections that can be urged
against the division of the public
schools we demand; for we do not
count as such the pretence of some
over-zealous Protestants that it is necessary
to detach the children of
Catholics from the Catholic Church
in order that they may grow up thorough
Americans; and as the public
schools are very effectual in so detaching
them, and weakening their
respect for the religion of their parents,
and their reverence for their clergy,
they ought on all patriotic grounds to
be maintained in full vigor as they
are. We have heard this objection
from over-zealous Evangelicals, and
still oftener from so-called Liberal
Christians and infidels; we have long
been told that the church is anti-American,
and can never thrive in the
United States; for she can never withstand
the free and enlightened spirit of
the country, and the decatholicizing influence
of our common schools; and
we can hardly doubt that some
thought of the kind is at the bottom
of much of the opposition the proposed
division of the public schools
has encountered. But we cannot
treat it as serious; for it is evidently
incompatible with the freedom of
conscience which the state is bound
by its constitution to recognize and
protect, for Catholics as well as for
Protestants. The state has no right
to make itself a proselyting institution
for or against Protestantism, for or
against Catholicity. It is its business
to protect us in the free and full enjoyment
of our religion, not to engage
in the work of unmaking our children
of their Catholicity. The case is one
of conscience, and conscience is accountable
to no civil tribunal. All
secular authority and all secular considerations
whatever must yield to
conscience. In questions of conscience
the law of God governs, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a plurality of votes. The state
abuses its authority if it sustains the
common schools as they are with a
view of detaching our children from
their Catholic faith and love. If Catholics
cannot retain their Catholic
faith and practice and still be true,
loyal, and exemplary American citizens,
it must be only because Americanism
is incompatible with the rights
of conscience, and that would be its
condemnation, not the condemnation
of Catholicity. No nationality can
override conscience; for conscience is
catholic, not national, and is accountable
to God alone, who is above and
over all nations, all principalities and
powers, King of kings and Lord of
lords. But the assumption in the objection
is not true. It mistakes the
opinion of the American people individually
for the constitution of the
American state. The American
state is as much Catholic as it is
Protestant, and really harmonizes far
better with Catholicity than with Protestantism.
We hold that, instead of
decatholicizing Catholic children, it
is far more necessary, if we are to be
governed by reasons of this sort, to
unmake the children of Protestants of
their Protestantism. We really believe
that, in order to train them up
to be, in the fullest sense, true, loyal,
and exemplary American citizens,
such as can alone arrest the present
downward tendency of the republic,
and realize the hopes of its heroic and
noble-hearted founders, they must become
good Catholics.</p>

<p>But this is a question of which the
state can take no cognizance. We
have under its constitution no right
to call upon it to aid us, directly or
indirectly, in unmaking Protestant
children of their Protestantism. Of
course, before God, or in the spiritual
order, we recognize no equality between
Catholicity and Protestantism.
Before God, no man has any right to
be of any religion but the Catholic,
the only true religion, the only religion
by which men can be raised to
union with God in the beatific vision.
But before the American state, we
recognize in Protestants equal rights
with our own. They have the same
right to be protected by the state in
the freedom of their conscience that
we have to be protected by it in the
freedom of ours. We should attack
the very freedom of conscience the
state guarantees to all her citizens,
were we to call upon it to found or to
continue a system of public schools,
at the public expense, intended or
fitted to detach Protestant children
from the religion of their parents, and
turn them over to be brought up
in the Catholic religion. We should
prove ourselves decidedly un-American
in so doing. Yet, we regret to say,
this is precisely what the non-catholic
majority, inconsiderately we trust, are
doing; and, if the popular ministers
of the several sects, like Dr. R.
W. Clark, Dr. Sheldon, Dr. Bellows,
Henry Ward Beecher, and the sectarian
and secular press have their way,
they will continue to do to the end of
the chapter to us Catholics. They
probably are not aware that they belie
the Americanism they profess, and
abuse the power their superiority of
numbers gives them to tyrannize over
the consciences of their fellow-citizens.
This strikes us as very un-American,
as well as very unjust.</p>

<p>We place our demand for separate
schools on the ground of conscience,
and therefore of right&mdash;the right of God
as well as of man. Our conscience
forbids us to support schools at the
public expense from which our religion
is excluded, and in which our
children are taught either what we
hold to be a false or mutilated religion,
or no religion at all. Such
schools are perilous to the souls of
our children; and we dare avow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
even in this age of secularism and infidelity,
that we place the salvation of
the souls of our children above every
other consideration. This plea of
conscience, which we urge from the
depth of our souls, and under a fearful
sense of our accountability to our
Maker, ought to suffice, especially in
an appeal to a state bound by its own
constitution to protect the rights of
conscience for each and all of its citizens,
whether Protestant or Catholic.</p>

<p>One thing must be evident from
past experience, that our children can
be brought up to be good and orderly
citizens only as Catholics, and in
schools under the supervision and
control of their church, in which her
faith is freely and fully taught, and
her services, discipline, and influences
are brought to bear in forming their
characters, restraining them from evil,
and training them to virtue. We do
not say that, even if trained in Catholic
schools, all will turn out to be
good practical Catholics and virtuous
members of society; for the church
does not take away free-will, nor eradicate
all the evil propensities of the
flesh; but it is certain that they cannot
be made such in schools in which
the religion of their parents is reviled
as a besotted superstition, and the very
text-books of history and geography
are made to protest against it; or in
which they are accustomed to hear
their priests spoken of without reverence,
Protestant nations lauded as
the only free and enlightened nations
of the earth, Catholic nations sneered
at as ignorant and enslaved, and the
church denounced as a spiritual despotism,
full of craft, and crusted all
over with corruption both of faith
and morals. Such schools may weaken
their reverence for their parents,
even detach them from their church,
obscure, if not destroy their faith, render
them indifferent to religion, indocile
to their parents, disobedient to
the laws; but they cannot inspire them
with the love of virtue, restrain their
vicious or criminal propensities, or
prevent them from associating with
the dangerous classes of our large
towns and cities, and furnishing subjects
for the correctional police, our
jails, penitentiaries, state prisons, and
the gallows.</p>

<p>We are pointed to the vicious and
criminal population of our cities, of
which we furnish more than our due
proportion, as a conclusive argument
against the moral tendency of our religion,
and a savage howl of indignation,
that rings throughout the land,
is set up against the legislature or the
municipality that ventures to grant us
the slightest aid in our struggles to
protect our children from the dangers
that beset them, though bearing no
proportion to the aid granted to non-Catholics.
Yet it is precisely to meet
cases like ours that a public provision
for education is needed and supposed
to be made. Protestants make
the great mistake of trying to cure
the evil to which we refer by detaching
our children from the church,
and bringing them up bad Protestants,
or without any religion. The
thousand and one associations and
institutions formed by Protestant zeal
and benevolence for the reformation
or the bringing up of poor Catholic
children, and some of which go so
far as to kidnap little papist orphans
or half orphans, lock them up in
their orphan asylums, where no priest
can enter, change their names so that
their relatives cannot trace them, send
them to a distance, and place them
in Protestant families, where it is hoped
they will forget their Catholic origin,
all proceed from the same mistake,
and all fail to arrest, or even to lessen,
the growing evil. They necessarily
provoke the opposition and resistance
of the Catholic pastors, and of all
earnest Catholics, who regard the loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of their faith as the greatest calamity
that can befall Catholic children.
So long as faith remains, however
great the vice or the crime, there is
something to build on, and room to
hope for repentance, though late, for
reformation and final salvation. Faith
once gone, all is gone.</p>

<p>It is necessary to understand that
the children of Catholics must be
trained up in the Catholic faith, in
the Catholic Church, to be good exemplary
Catholics, or they will grow
up bad citizens, the pests of society.
Nothing can be done for them but
through the approval and coÃ¶peration
of the Catholic clergy and the Catholic
community. The contrary rule, till
quite recently, has been adopted, and
public and private benevolence has
sought to benefit our children by disregarding,
or seeking to uproot, their
Catholic faith, and rejecting the coÃ¶peration
of the Catholic clergy. The
results are apparent to all not absolutely
blinded by their misdirected
zeal.</p>

<p>The public has not sufficiently considered
that by the law excluding our
religion from the public schools, the
schools as established by law are Protestant
schools, at least so far as they
are not pagan or godless. We do
not suppose the state ever intended
to establish Protestantism as the exclusive
religion of the schools; but
such is the necessary result of excluding,
no matter under what pretext,
the teaching of our religion in them.
Exclude Catholicity, and what is left?
Nothing of Christianity but Protestantism,
which is simply Christianity
<em>minus</em> the Catholic Church, her faith,
precepts, and sacraments. At present
the state makes ample provision
for the children of Protestants, infidels,
or pagans; but excludes the
children of Catholics, unless we consent
to let them be educated in Protestant
schools, and brought up Protestants,
so far as the schools can
bring them up.</p>

<p>Now, we protest in the name of
equal rights against this manifest injustice.
There is no class of the
community more in need of free public
schools than Catholics, and none
are more entitled to their benefit; for
they constitute a large portion of the
poorer and more destitute classes of
the community. We can conceive
nothing more unjust than for the state
to provide schools for Protestants, and
even infidels, and refuse to do it for
Catholics. To say that Catholics
have as free access to the public
schools as Protestants, is bitter mockery.
Protestants can send their children
to them without exposing them
to lose their Protestantism; but Catholics
cannot send their children to
them without exposing them to the loss
of their Catholicity. The law protects
their religion in the public schools by
the simple fact of excluding ours.
How then say these schools are as free
to us as they are to them? Is conscience
of no account?</p>

<p>We take it for granted that the intention
of the state is that the public
schools should be accessible alike to
Catholics and Protestants, and on the
same risks and conditions. We presume
it has had no more intention
of favoring Protestants at the expense
of Catholics, than Catholics at the
expense of Protestants. But it can
no longer fail to see that its intention
is not, and cannot be realized by providing
schools which Protestants can
use without risk to their Protestantism,
and none which Catholics can
use without risk to their Catholicity.
As the case now stands, the law sustains
Protestantism in the schools and
excludes Catholicity. This is unjust
to Catholics, and deprives us, in so
far as Catholics, of all benefit to be
derived from the public schools supported
at the public expense. Were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the law to admit Catholicity, it would
necessarily exclude Protestantism,
which would be equally unjust to Protestants.
Since, then, Catholicity and
Protestantism mutually exclude each
other, and as the state is bound to
treat both with equal respect, it is not
possible for it to carry out its intention
and do justice to both parties,
but by dividing the schools, and setting
apart for Catholics their proportion
of them, in which the education
shall be determined and controlled
by their church, though remaining
public schools supported at the public
expense, under the provisions of a general
law as now.</p>

<p>This would be doing for its Catholic
citizens only what it now does for
its Protestant citizens only; in fact,
only what is done in France, Austria,
and Prussia. The division would enable
us to bring all our children into
schools under the influence and management
of our pastors, and to do
whatever the church and a thoroughly
religious education can do to train
them up to be good Catholics, and
therefore orderly and peaceful members
of society, and loyal and virtuous
American citizens. It would also
remove some restraint from the
Protestant schools, and allow them
more freedom in insisting on whatever
is doctrinal and positive in their
religion than they now exercise. The
two classes of schools, though operating
separately, would aid each other
in stemming the tide of infidelity and
immorality, now setting in with such
fearful rapidity, and apparently resistless
force, threatening the very existence
of our republic. The division
would operate in favor of religion,
both in a Catholic sense and in a
Protestant sense, and therefore tend
to purify and preserve American society.
It would restore the schools
to their original intention, and make
them, what they should be, religious
schools.</p>

<p>The enemy which the state, which
Catholics, and which Protestants have
alike to resist and vanquish by education
is the irreligion, pantheism,
atheism, and immorality, disguised as
secularism, or under the specious
names of science, humanity, free-religion,
and free-love, which not only
strike at all Christian faith and Christian
morals, but at the family, the state,
and civilized society itself. The state
has no right to regard this enemy with
indifference, and on this point we accept
the able arguments used by the serious
Protestant preachers and writers
cited in the number of <cite>The Christian
World</cite> before us against the exclusion
of the Bible and all recognition of
religion from the public schools. The
American state is not infidel or godless,
and is bound always to recognize
and actively aid religion as far
as in its power. Having no spiritual
or theological competency, it has no
right to undertake to say what shall
or shall not be the religion of its citizens;
it must accept, protect, and aid
the religion its citizens see proper to
adopt, and without partiality for the
religion of the majority any more than
the religion of the minority; for in
regard to religion the rights and powers
of minorities and majorities are
equal. The state is under the Christian
law, and it is bound to protect
and enforce Christian morals and its
laws, whether assailed by Mormonism,
spiritism, free-lovism, pantheism,
or atheism.</p>

<p>The modern world has strayed far
from this doctrine, which in the early
history of this country nobody questioned.
The departure may be falsely
called progress, and boasted of as
a result of "the march of intellect;"
but it must be arrested, and men
must be recalled to the truths they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
have left behind, if republican government
is to be maintained, and
Christian society preserved. Protestants
who see and deplore the departure
from the old landmarks will find
themselves unable to arrest the downward
tendency without our aid, and little
aid shall we be able to render them
unless the church be free to use the
public schools&mdash;that is, her portion
of them&mdash;to bring up her children
in her own faith, and train them to
be good Catholics. There is a recrudescence
of paganism, a growth
of subtle and disguised infidelity,
which it will require all that both
they and we can do to arrest. Fight,
therefore, Protestants, no longer us,
but the public enemy.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

THE ROMISH SYSTEM."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></h2>


<p>The reply of the <cite>New Englander</cite> to
our articles of September and October
last is bristling with the most palpable
and absurd mistakes. We call them
"mistakes" through the utmost stretch
of Christian charity, for there is really
no excuse to be made for them. We
cannot excuse them by allowing either
their author or the editors of the <cite>New
Englander</cite> the benefit of the plea of
ignorance; for they were bound to
inform themselves on a grave matter
which they profess to treat of; nor
that of haste and carelessness. They
have had at least three months for a
reply, and were at liberty to take three
months more, if necessary; and to
plead carelessness in such a matter is
equivalent to a confession of culpable
negligence and want of moral principle.
They were bound by the principles
of the Christian religion not to
exaggerate or convey in any way a
worse impression of their fellow-Christians
than the exact truth would warrant,
according to the words of St.
Paul, "Charity is kind, thinketh no
evil, ... is not puffed up;"
which we might paraphrase in this
way: Is not pharisaically inclined to
exalt one's self at the expense of one's
neighbor, or at the sacrifice of the
truth. The <cite>New Englander</cite> has made
use of every artifice; and, trusting to
the unsuspecting ignorance or uncritical
spirit of the community, of a
shameful perversion of the truth to
effect this unworthy and unchristian
object. We speak severely because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
is time the public, both Catholic and
Protestant, should frown upon such
practices, and endeavor to approach
Christian unity by the practice of the
most ordinary Christian virtues. We
shall now proceed to make good our
allegations against the <cite>New Englander</cite>.</p>

<p>1st. The <cite>New Englander</cite> makes a
comparison of the provinces of Catholic
and Protestant countries, prefaced
by the following introduction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The author of <cite>Evenings with the Romanists</cite>,
writing in 1854, gave the names
and official returns of ten principal cities of
Protestant Prussia and of ten principal cities
of Roman Catholic Austria.... <span class="smcap">The
Catholic World</span> admits the statements,
... and claims, with that air of injured
innocence, which is so favorite a weapon in
Romish polemics, that, if the returns of the
provinces were brought into the account,
they would more than redress the balance of
the cities. We proceed to put his proposition
to experiment."</p></blockquote>

<p>Would our readers credit it, that he
has done nothing of the kind? He
has not compared the Protestant and
Catholic provinces of Protestant Prussia
and Roman Catholic Austria, between
which, and which alone, the parallel
comparison of cities was made;
but substituted another comparison,
entirely his own, introducing provinces
belonging to other countries to weigh
down the Catholic scale, and excluding
half the Catholic provinces of Austria
for the same purpose. This we
will show to a demonstration. Here
is the table of the <cite>New Englander</cite>:</p>

<p>We repeat, the question as put by
the <cite>New Englander</cite> itself is not about
<em>German</em> provinces, but of the Protestant
and Roman Catholic provinces
of Prussia and Austria. Moreover,
the table as it stands is grossly untrue.
The rate of illegitimacy of the
province of Prussia is 9 instead of
6.7, which materially alters the general
average.</p>

<p>The averages of the table are falsely
given as,</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="rspace">Protestant</span><span class="rspace">11.7</span><span class="lspace rspace">Catholic</span>18.6<br />
</p>

<p>The true averages found by balancing
the populations and the rates, according
to the rules of arithmetic, are:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="rspace">Protestant</span><span class="rspace">12</span><span class="lspace rspace">Catholic</span>16.9<br />
</p>

<p>Besides these grave blunders, the
<cite>New Englander</cite>, professing to give a
statement of the <em>German</em> provinces
by taking <em>Germany</em>, "province by
province," has omitted many German
provinces, which omission very materially
affects the result. We take the
liberty of putting them in to show
how "economical" of truth the <cite>New
Englander</cite> has been.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to do what the
<cite>New Englander</cite> professed to do, but
merely shifting the question, has not
done, namely, compare the Catholic
and Protestant provinces of Protestant
Prussia and Roman Catholic Austria,
province by province, as they existed
previous to the last war, to correspond
to the comparison of the cities of these
countries which were contained within
these limits. Milan, as well as Lemburg
and Zara, are put down among
the Austrian cities. We shall give
the corresponding provinces:</p>

<p>We have thus shown, by a mathematical
demonstration, that the words
which the <cite>New Englander</cite> found convenient
to put in our mouths, though
we really said nothing of the kind, that
"if the returns of the provinces were
brought into the account, they would
more than redress the balance of the
cities," are sufficiently made good. We
are glad he "proceeded to put our
proposition to experiment," and we
caution him when he makes any more
experiments of this kind to reflect
that, whatever may be the judgment
of an uncritical public prepared to
take his statements without examination,
his artifices, misstatements, and
false conclusions are sure to be detected
by any well-informed reader
who will take the trouble of examining
them. The result of the comparison
of the Protestant and Roman
Catholic provinces of Austria and
Prussia sums up in this fashion:</p>

<p class="center"><i>False Average of the New Englander.</i><br />

<span class="rspace">Protestant</span><span class="rspace">11.7</span><span class="lspace rspace">Catholic</span>18.6<br /><br />

<p>We have thus finished this part of
our task, strictly confining ourselves
to the provinces in question; but as it
seems more complete to add the other
German provinces on both sides, of
which returns are given, we do so

<p>We dismiss the <cite>New Englander</cite>
from the examination of provinces
with the conviction that he ought
now to become a wiser if not a
better man.</p>

<p>2dly. The <cite>New Englander</cite> gives
us another division of his work, entitled
thus, "3. <i>Comparison of mixed
populations</i>," the object of which seems
to be two-fold: 1st, To show the wonderful
effect of a little Protestant salt
in a mass of Catholic corruption; and
2dly, to push up the rate of Catholic
Austria to a high figure by excluding
the best half of it, and thus to come out
with flying colors in the grand tabular
statement of all the European countries.
He commences with the following
round but very novel statement:
"The empire of Austria includes
a population of 31,655,746;
of these, 21,082,801 or two thirds,
are non-Romanists, belonging to the
Protestant church or Greek Church."</p>

<p>The population of the empire of
Austria is really divided as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="rspace">Catholic</span><span class="lspace">26,728,020</span><br />
<span class="rspace">All others</span><span class="lspace">7,703,976</span><br />
</p>

<p>by which specimen we may form a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>good judgment of the general accuracy
of the <cite>New Englander</cite>.</p>

<p>He goes on, "In nine of the Austrian
provinces the population is almost
exclusively Roman Catholic. In
seven, the Roman Catholics are, on an
average, in a minority of 46 per cent."
He proves these assertions by a table
of</p>

<p class="center"><i>Mixed Provinces.</i></p>

<p>accompanied by the following remark:
"This falling of the rate of illegitimacy
from twenty-one to six, when the
proportion of Romanists to the population
falls off from ninety-seven to
forty-six, indicates the salutary effect
of Protestant Christianity, not only on
its own followers, but also on the
working of Romanism itself." But
suppose the population does not fall
off from ninety-seven to forty-six per
cent, and that in most of these provinces,
and where the rate of illegitimacy
is the lowest, there are no
Protestants at all, and a small proportion
in the rest; what is shown,
then, unless it be the ignorance and
bad faith of the <cite>New Englander</cite>, which
professes to be the "recognized exponent
of those views <i>of religious life</i>
which have given character to New
England, and its essays to be among
the best fruits of thought and opinion
which the education given at Yale is
adapted to foster"? Alas! Messrs.

dropped nearly 4,000,000 of Roman
Catholics from your computation.

<p>The "salutary effect of Protestant
Christianity in" Galicia, Bukowina,
Dalmatia, MilitÃ¤rgrenze, Croatia, etc.,
is wonderful, and indeed little short
of miraculous, considering how exceedingly
small the quantity of it is.
If the presence of one per cent of
Protestants can so ameliorate the condition
of things in Galicia, what a
land of heavenly purity Connecticut
must be! But we arouse ourselves

entirely absorbed in these sublime

Protestant religion among people of
the same race, and living together in
the same communities, and under the
same laws. The census of illegitimacy
has been taken in Prussia according to
the religious faith of the people.</p>

<p>What strikes us first of all is the

Not that we shall literally be killed
off by them; but when we think of
the "best fruits" of the scholarship
of Yale College producing such averages,
by adding up a lot of rates of
all sorts of countries, big and little,
and dividing the sum by the number
of countries, the idea is absurd enough
to kill any one with laughter. Exuberance
of fancy has evidently exercised
an unfavorable influence on the
mathematical ability of the author of
this article, and neutralized the effect
of the excellent mathematical course
given at Yale College.</p>

<p>We find in the table Italy and Spain
marked with a note of interrogation,
as much as to say, "What business
have you here with such low averages?
You ought to look a great deal
worse than that, being such black and
benighted Romanist countries as you
are." And after them the word "defective"
in brackets. No doubt the
best of reasons will be given for this.
Let us see. "The returns for Italy
and Spain are utterly defective and
untrustworthy. Assuming the ordinary
birth-rate, the returns show that
in Italy <i>more than one fourth</i> of the
births fail to be registered." Why
does not the <cite>New Englander</cite> give the
figures, that we may judge for ourselves?
What he has not done we
will do for him:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Births in Italy.</i></p>

<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tdlp">Average</td><td class="tdr total">873,319</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The population of Italy is 24,231,860,
and the birth-rate of Europe, according
to the <cite>New Englander</cite>, is 1 to 28.
Dividing the number of the population
by 28, we get 865,608. The
number of actual births <em>exceeds</em> the
number expected, instead of being
<i>defective by "more than a fourth."</i>
As the reason alleged proves to be
utterly false, we shall strike off the
marks of interrogation from Italy,
and leave out the "defective" in
the brackets.</p>

<p>In like manner, the returns for
Spain are treated. "As for Spain,
its census returns, if quoted at all
among statistics, are quoted at even
a larger discount than its financial
securities. The sum of the Spanish
censuses for the last forty years has
been up and down after the following
zigzag fashion:</p>

<p>Not having found our friend of the

in his figures, we did not exactly
take them on trust this time, but looked
in our "Handbuch," and found the

designate as building "castles

<p>We beg our readers' pardon for

it.</p>

<p>The <cite>New Englander</cite> has been quite
hard on us for classing Holland and
Switzerland, in which there are very
large Catholic minorities, as mixed
countries, and remanded them with
an air of injured innocence forthwith
into the Protestant column, where it
will be observed they present an uncommonly
good appearance, being the
lowest on the list. We have shown by
documentary evidence that in Prussia
in 1864, when there was a Catholic
minority of thirty-eight per cent, the
rate of illegitimacy was brought down
by it from 10 to 8.46, or, in other
words, if all the Catholics could be
removed at once out of the land, the
rate of Prussia would stand 10, whereas
it appears now 8.6. For this reason
we thought fit to make some distinction,
lest there should be any strutting
around in borrowed plumes, and to
form a table of mixed countries. We
shall, therefore, carefully avoiding any
further wounding of the delicate susceptibilities
of the <cite>New Englander</cite>,
append a table, making allowances for
the minorities on both sides, coming

<p>Here we are glad to end the general
investigation, and to show that, if
we are not very much better than our
neighbors, we are not any worse, and
are not to be hounded down with the
cry of vice and immorality by a set
of Pharisees who are constantly lauding
their own superiority, and thanking
God they are so much better than
we poor Catholics.</p>

<p>We must notice, before we conclude,
some minor points of the <cite>New
Englander's</cite> reply to <span class="smcap">The Catholic
World</span>. He insists that it is highly
improbable that any of the foundlings
received into the hospital at Rome
come from the provinces, and says
we have not adduced a particle of
proof to the contrary. Well, as far
as the readers of the <cite>New Englander</cite>
are concerned, what is the use of adducing
any proof?&mdash;for that very
Christian journal takes no notice of any
refutations of its statements, nor concedes
any point, however strongly
proved, but is solely occupied in
showing, by fair means or foul, our
"total depravity," as if the very life
and breath of the Protestant religion
depended on maintaining a deep and
bitter hatred and contempt of Catholics.
To our own readers, we do not
think it worth while to adduce any
particular proof of a self-evident proposition.
If there be a foundling hospital,
receiving infants left at its door,
it requires no proof that it will serve
the adjacent country as well as the
city. We have documentary evidence
to prove this point; but the <cite>New Englander</cite>
contains so many errors which
require our attention, that we have
not space for so trivial a matter. We
would like, however, to ask our friend
of the <cite>New Englander</cite> whether he believes
any of the <em>three thousand</em> infants
received in the foundling hospital of
Amsterdam come from the country.</p>

<p>2d. <cite>The New Englander</cite> says,
"But where do the infants come from
that are received in the multitudes of
<em>country</em> nunneries that abound throughout
the rural districts, and commonly
have each its <i>crÃ¨che</i>, or cradle, in which
the child of shame may be dropped
in secret with a ring of the bell, and
left?"</p>

<p>It is time enough to answer this
question when any proof of its truth
is brought forward; but we can assure
our friend that if any infants are so
received, they all find their way to
the hospital in short order.</p>

<p>3d. We find the following unique
and highly gentlemanly insinuation in
the <cite>New Englander</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'The <cite>Civilta Cattolica</cite> says, "This proportion
of 28.3 of legitimate births for every
one thousand of the population speaks very
well for a capital city." And so it does; it
shows, what we have always understood
them to be, that the Romans are as virtuous
and moral as any people of the world.'
Thus <span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span>; to which it
might safely add, that it shows that the separation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of an enormous mass of the most
vigorous part of the people under vows of
celibacy and continence does not necessarily
check the multiplication of the population."</p></blockquote>

<p>Weakness in arithmetic and a prurient
imagination have, no doubt,
given rise to the above elegant extract;
but we rebut it by informing
our friend of the <cite>New Englander</cite> that
there is a difference between 28.3 to
the thousand and 1 to 28.3. Had he
noticed this difference, he would not
have digged this pit for himself. The
figures prove nothing more than his
own ignorance, putting the most charitable
construction on it.</p>

<p>We must give a specimen of the
<cite>New Englander's</cite> idea of fairness in
controversy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In his <cite>Evenings with the Romanists</cite>,
Mr. Seymour, anticipating the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tu quoque</i> retort
of the Roman Catholics, said, 'If any
man will name the worst of the Protestant
countries, I care not which, I will name a
Roman Catholic country still worse.' In
this way, he proceeded to compare, in 1854,
Saxony with Carinthia and sundry other regions
on either side, whereupon <span class="smcap">The Catholic
World</span> has a violent outbreak of mingled
indignation and erudition at the extreme
trickiness of comparing Styria, Upper
and Lower Austria, Carinthia, Salzburg,
Trieste, which are not countries at all, but
simply the German provinces of the Austrian
Empire, and Bavaria, with countries
so different and wide apart as Norway,
Sweden, Saxony, Hanover, and WÃ¼rtemburg;
the regions in question seem to
have been selected for their approximate
equality in population."</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, as probably most people have
not heard of the <em>countries</em> of Carinthia,
Styria, etc., we confess we were "erudite"
enough to know and to point
out that they were slices of Austria
carved for the occasion, and we were
a little indignant at the carving operation.</p>

<p>"Show me a bad <i>Protestant country</i>
where you please, and I will show you
a <i>Roman Catholic country still worse</i>."
Hence, we have, according to Mr.
Seymour:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Protestant and Roman Catholic Countries" width="100%">
<tr><td class="tdl" width="50%">PROTESTANT COUNTRIES.</td><td class="tdl" width="50%">ROMAN CATHOLIC COUNTRIES.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdlp">Norway,</td><td class="tdlp">Austria,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdlp">Sweden,</td><td class="tdlp">Austria,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdlp">Saxony,</td><td class="tdlp">Austria,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdlp">Denmark,</td><td class="tdlp">Austria,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdlp">Hanover,</td><td class="tdlp">Austria,</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We suppose this is all fair enough;
but we cannot see it, our moral vision
being so infirm.</p>

<p>"But these regions seem to have
been selected for their approximate
equality in population." So it seems,
and our friend, Mr. S., has <em>made it
seem</em> so in this fashion: "We compare
Protestant Norway with 1,194,610,
and Roman Catholic Styria (Austria)
with 1,006,971. Again, we compare
Protestant Sweden with 2,983,144, and
Roman Catholic Upper and Lower
(Austria) with 2,244,363." All very
good; but now let us go on: "We
compare Protestant Saxony <i>with its
population</i>, and Roman Catholic Carinthia
<i>with its population</i>. And we
compare Hanover <i>with its Protestant
population</i>, and Salzburg <i>with its
Roman Catholic population</i>." "'Of
course these countries are selected
<i>for their approximate equality in population</i>.'"
In order that our readers
may see how much <i>equality</i> there is
in the populations of these countries,
we give the following</p>

<p class="center"><i>Table of Populations.</i></p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Populations table" width="100%">
<tr><td class="tdc" colspan="2">PROTESTANT.</td><td class="tdc" colspan="2">CATHOLIC.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Hanover</td><td class="tdrp">1,923,492</td><td class="tdl">Salzburg</td><td class="tdr">147,191</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Saxony is only seven times greater
than Carinthia. Hanover only twelve
times greater than Salzburg. Very
excellent is Mr. Seymour in "anticipating
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tu quoque</i> of the Roman
Catholics."</p>

<p>We now desire to call the attention
of our readers to one very remarkable
phenomenon of the statistics. In
Protestant England the cities have a
lower rate of illegitimacy than the
country, while in France the case is
reversed, the countries are low and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the cities high. The following table
will show this:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Rates of Illegitimacy in City and Country Districts
of England.</i></p>

<p>From this we draw the conclusion
that for Protestants city life is decidedly
the best, and it will be the duty of
ministers to crowd as many of their
flocks as possible out of the polluted
air of the country into the moral atmosphere
of the cities, and in England
to endeavor to concentrate them
particularly in the very virtuous communities
of London and Liverpool.
But we are sorry the gospel trumpet
gives such a feeble sound in the country
districts, and we hope some of the
city clergy will get <em>a call</em> to go into
these benighted districts, (abjuring the
brown-stone fronts and high salaries,)
and bring them back at least to the
level of the city population, where
there are <i>so many and varied temptations,
and such surprising purity</i>. Our
Catholic people seem to flourish better
in the country, and we sincerely
hope that those who come over from
Europe will get farms out West, instead
of settling down in New-York
or other cities. We did have an idea
that the influence of religion was best
exerted in the country, where the
pastor knows each one of his flock,
and would rather have compared the
country people in Protestant lands
with the country people in Catholic
lands, to test the influence of religion
upon them; but as the <cite>New Englander</cite>
seems to think the comparison is best
made in the cities, we leave every reflective
person to form his own judgment.
If the <cite>New Englander</cite> is
right, we fear our Lord was wrong
in asking us to pray, "Lead us not
into temptation;" but Protestants
should rather pray, "Lead us into
temptation," because it is precisely in
temptation they are most virtuous.</p>

<p>We did not intend to say a single
word on the subject of murders, etc.,
because we have not any complete
statistics on the subject, and because
we do not like the labor of hunting
them up, just at present; but as this
thing is paraded before us like a red
rag before a bull, we will just make
one dash at it, and, giving it a blow
sufficient to dispatch it, leave the rest
of the matter until we find it convenient
to take it up. Mr. Seymour gave
the following items in his book:</p>

<h2>THE FIRST &OElig;CUMENICAL COUNCIL OF THE VATICAN.<br />

<small>NO. THREE.</small></h2>

<p>The second month of the Vatican
Council has seen no interruption of
its labors, nor of the intense interest
which these labors seem to excite on
every side. In truth, the intensity of
this interest, especially among those
who are not friendly to the council,
would be inexplicable, did we not
feel that there is in reality a struggle
involved therein between the cause
of religion and the cause of irreligion.
The meetings of the prelates are private
and quiet. The subjects under
discussion are, at best, only vaguely
known outside. The names of the
speakers may be learned. You may
ascertain, if you persist in the effort,
that one bishop has a fine voice, and
was well heard; that another has an
exceedingly polished delivery; that a
third is remarkable for the fluency,
and a fourth for the classic elegance
with which he spoke in Latin. But
all your efforts will fail to elicit a report
of the substance of the speech of
any prelate. These speeches are for
the council itself&mdash;for the assembled
fathers to whom they are delivered&mdash;and
are not for the public at large,
nor for Buncombe. They are under
the guard of the honor of the bishops
and the oath of the officials, and are
to be kept secret until the acts of the
council are lawfully published. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
yet "own correspondents," "occasional
correspondents," "special correspondents,"
and "reliable correspondents"
from Rome have failed
not, day after day, to fill the columns
of newspapers&mdash;Italian, French, English,
German, Belgian, and Spanish,
and doubtless others also, if we saw
them&mdash;with their guesses and suspicions,
their tiny grains of truth and
bushels of fiction. Ponderous columns
of editorial comments are often
superadded, as it were, to increase
the amount of mystery and the mass
of errors. Even the brief telegraphic
notices seem to be often controlled or
made to work in this sense. The telegrams
from Rome itself ought to be,
and we presume are, correct. The
author of a flagrant misstatement sent
from this city could be identified and
held responsible. But it is said that,
outside of the limits of the Pontifical
States, there is a news-agent who culls
from letters sent him for that purpose
most of those wonderful statements
about the council which the telegraph
wires are made to flash over Europe,
and even across the Atlantic to America.
The result of all this on the
mind of one in Rome is ofttimes
amusing. During our civil war, we
once found ourselves in a railway car
with an officer who had lost an arm.
"Colonel," asked some one, "in what
battle were you wounded?" The
colonel laid down the papers he had
been reading, sighed heavily, as if
wearied, at least in mind, and answered,
"At the time, I thought it
was at the battle of Chancellorsville;
but since I have been reading these
newspaper accounts of that battle, I
have come to the conclusion that I
was not there at all." The newspaper
reporters of the council labor under
far greater difficulties than did the
army correspondents, and are proportionately
inaccurate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the council moves on
in its direct course, like a majestic
steamer on the ocean, undisturbed by
these winds blowing alternately from
every point of the compass, and unheeding
the wavelets they strive to
raise. Within the council, every thing
is proceeding smoothly and harmoniously,
some think more slowly than
was anticipated. But the fathers of
the council feel they have a great
work to do conscientiously, and they
are engaged earnestly and in the fear
of God in its performance.</p>

<p>As yet, a third public session of the
council has not been held, nor has
any public announcement been made
of the day when it may be looked
for. But the time is busily employed.
We stated in our last number that a
<i>schema</i> or draft on some doctrinal
points had been given to the prelates
early in December, and had been
learnedly discussed, no less than thirty-five
speakers having canvassed its
merits. At the conclusion of the discussion,
the <i>schema</i> was referred to
the Deputation, or Committee on
Faith. All the discourses had been
taken down and written out by stenographers,
with an accuracy which
astonished and elicited the commendation
of such bishops as examined
the report of their own speeches.
These reports were likewise handed
over to the committee, that no remark
might be overlooked or forgotten.
All will be taken into consideration
and duly weighed, together with
further remarks before the committee,
by the theologians who drew up the
<i>schema</i> in the Preparatory Committee.
The committee is charged to present
the matured result to the assembled
congregation at the proper time, when
it will again be considered, perhaps
discussed, and finally voted on.</p>

<p>On January 14th, the fathers again
assembled in a general congregation
in the council-hall, altered and restricted
as we have already described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
it. Mass was celebrated at nine <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>,
as is always done, by one of the
senior prelates. At its conclusion,
the five presiding cardinals took their
place. Cardinal De Angelis, the
chief one, took his seat for the first
time, and recited the usual opening
prayer.</p>

<p>At the previous congregations, five
of the <i>deputations</i> of the council had
been filled by election. The sixth&mdash;that
on oriental rites and on missions&mdash;still
remained to be filled. Twenty-four
members were to be elected by
ballot.</p>

<p>The election was held in the usual
form. The bishops had brought with
them their ballots already written out.
Several attendants passed, two and
two, along the seats of the prelates,
one of them bearing a small wicker-work
basket. Each prelate deposited
therein his ballot. In a few moments
all had quietly voted. The baskets
were borne to the secretary's table in
the middle, in front of the presiding
cardinals. The ballots were placed in
boxes prepared to receive them. The
boxes were closed and sealed, to be
opened afterward before the regular
committee for this purpose, when the
votes would be counted, and the result
ascertained.</p>

<p>The following prelates were elected:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Most Rev. Peter Bostani, Archbishop of
Tyre and Sidon, Maronite, Asia.</p>

<p>Most Rev. Vincent Spaccapietra, Archbishop

<p>Rt. Rev. James Quin, Bishop of Brisbane,
Australia.</p>

<p>Rt. Rev. Charles Poirier, Bishop of Roseau,
West Indies.</p>

<p>His Eminence Cardinal Alexander BarnabÃ²,
Prefect of the Propaganda, was appropriately
named chairman of this committee.</p></blockquote>

<p>No one in Rome, or elsewhere,
could be found better qualified for
this position than this eminent and
well-known cardinal, who has for so
many years, and so ably, presided over
the congregation specially charged
with superintending the world-wide
missions of the Catholic Church.
Born in the year 1798, he was in his
early boyhood when Napoleon annexed
Italy to his empire. When the
conqueror, in order to bind the country
to him, ordered that a number of
the sons of the noble and most respectable
families of Italy should be
sent to the Ecole Polytechnique at
Paris, to be educated, as it were, under
his own eye, the bright-eyed Alessandro
BarnabÃ² was selected with others.
He continued in that school until the
fall of Napoleon restored Pius VII. to
Rome. The lad could soon return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
home likewise, and devote himself,
according to the aspirations of earlier
years, to the service of God in the
sanctuary. He pursued his ecclesiastical
studies with distinction under
De Rossi, Finotti, Graziosi, Palma,
and the giant professors of those
years in Rome; became priest; and
naturally, with his learning, his energy,
his amiability, was soon selected to
give assistance in the congregations
for the transaction of ecclesiastical
business of the church in Rome. In
due time he became secretary to the
Congregation of the Propaganda, and
made himself familiar with the affairs
and men of the church throughout
the world. Subsequently raised to
the cardinalate, amid the applause of
Rome, he succeeded Cardinal Fransoni
in the prefectship of the same Congregation
of the Propaganda where
he had been secretary, and over
which he, for many years, presided
with an executive ability not equalled
since the days of Cardinal CapellarÃ²,
afterward Gregory XV.</p>

<p>This election having been finished,
the bishops then entered on the examination
of matters of ecclesiastical
discipline, several <i>schemata</i>, or draughts,
on which had been presented to them
for private study some time before.
It is the ordinary usage of councils to
examine matters of faith and matters
of discipline as nearly <i>pari passu</i>
as can conveniently be done. It
seems this usage will be observed in
the Vatican Council. There is a fundamental
difference between matters
of faith and matters of discipline.</p>

<p>The faith of the church is ever one&mdash;that
originally delivered to her by the
apostles. A council cannot alter it.
The errors or heresies prevailing at
any time, the uncertainty in some
minds, or other needs of a period,
may render it proper or necessary to
give a fuller, clearer, and more definite
expression of that faith on points
controverted or misunderstood. The
question always is, What has really
been the faith held in the past, from
the beginning, by the church on these
points? The answer is sought in the
words of Holy Writ, in the past declarations
of the church, whether in the
decrees of her councils or in the authoritative
teachings of her sovereign
pontiffs, and in her traditions, as
shown in the liturgies and forms of
prayer, in the testimony of her ancient
doctors and fathers, and in the
concurrent teachings of the general
body of her pastors and her theologians.
The whole field of evidence
is searched, and the answer stands
forth in noon-day light; and the
council declares what really and truly
has been and is the belief and teaching
of the Catholic Church on the
question before it. And that declaration
is accepted by the Catholic world,
not simply on the word of men, however
great their knowledge or accurate
and scrutinizing their research&mdash;nor
simply on account of their holiness
of life, their sincerity of heart, or the
impartiality of their decision. These
are, indeed, high motives, such as the
world must always respect, and perhaps
enough ordinarily to satisfy human
minds. But, after all, they are
but human motives. The Catholic is
taught to base his belief on a higher
motive&mdash;the divine assurance of our
Saviour himself that he would always
be with his church until the end of
time, that he would send the spirit
of truth to teach her all truth and
to abide with her for ever, and that
the gates of hell should never prevail
against her. Our ears catch the
words of the Saviour, "Whosoever
heareth you, heareth me;&mdash;whosoever
despiseth you, despiseth me;" and
we know that the church is thus
made the pillar and ground of truth,
and that he that will not hear the
church is like the heathen and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
publican. Hence on his divine word,
which must stand though the heavens
and the earth pass away, we accept
the declarations and teachings of the
church, through her councils, as the
continuation of the teaching of Christ
himself.</p>

<p>Such was the examination made in
the Council of Nice, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 325; such
was the spirit of faith in which its
words were received when it declared
the original and true belief of the
church on the doctrines of the trinity
and incarnation, and condemned the
novelties of Arius and his followers.
Such was the examination made in the
councils of Ephesus, Constantinople
first and second, and of Chalcedon;
such the filial faith in which their decrees
were received as they declared
more and more fully and explicitly
the true Catholic doctrine of the
incarnation, and condemned successively
the errors of the Nestorians, the
Monophysites, and the Monothelites.
Such was the course pursued in the various
&oelig;cumenical councils which followed,
down to and including the
Council of Trent. Such was the spirit
in which their declarations of the faith
have ever been received. To us, the
Catholic Church of Christ is a living
church, possessing, by the gift of her
divine Founder, authority to teach in
his name all that he taught, and ever
guarded by his divine power from so
falling under the assaults of hell as
to teach error to man in his name, instead
of the divine truth which he
established and commissioned her to
teach. Her authority is ever the
same&mdash;the same in the first and second
centuries as in the fourth and
fifth, in the tenth and twelfth, in the
sixteenth, and in this nineteenth century;
and it will continue the same
until time shall be no more.</p>

<p>It is thus that the Vatican Council
takes up matters of faith, not to add
to the faith, but to declare it and to
establish it, where it has been impugned
or doubted or misunderstood.
The question is, What are the points
on which the errors and the needs of
this age render it proper and necessary
to give a renewed, perhaps a fuller,
clearer, and more emphatic declaration
of the doctrine of the church;
and in what form of words shall such
declarations be expressed? To all
these questions the bishops are bringing
their calmest and maturest judgment.
There will be, as there must
and should be, a free and frank interchange
of views and arguments, in
all sincerity and charity, even as in
the council of the apostles at Jerusalem
there was a great discussion before
the definitive result was declared
with authority: <i>It hath seemed good
to the Holy Ghost and to us.</i> When,
after such a discussion, the council
shall give forth its decisions and decrees,
they will be accepted by the
children of the church. They will
not be new doctrines. The Catholic
heart and conscience will recognize
them as portions of that faith which
has heretofore ever been held. So
true will this be, that we feel certain
that one of the points which many
of the enemies of the church will
bring against this council, after its conclusion,
will be, that it has done comparatively
nothing, that all that it
taught was known and believed
among Catholics before it was convened.
But the same thing was said
at the time of former councils, even
of those which proved to be the most
important and influential in the history
of Christianity.</p>

<p>But if faith is one and unchangeable,
ecclesiastical discipline, at least in
most of its details, is not. The church
has received power to bind and to
loose, and necessarily has authority
to establish a discipline, not simply
for the purpose of securing order within
her fold, but to reach the further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and higher purpose for which she herself
has been established and exists.
Men must not merely believe the truth
speculatively and with a dead faith.
They must, by practical obedience
to the law of God, by avoidance of
sin through the assistance of divine
grace, by practice of virtue and by
holiness of life, be guided to keep the
word which they have heard, and so
come to be saved. This practical
guidance is her discipline. The general
principles on which her action is
based are the maxims and precepts of
our divine Lord himself, the character
of the holy sacraments which he
established in his church to be the
channels of grace, the institutions
which came to her from the apostles,
and which she will ever preserve, and
those principles of right and morality
which God has planted in the heart
of man, and of which her divine commission
makes her the highest and
the most authoritative exponent.
These principles are sacred and
unchangeable. But in applying them to
men there must be a large body of
laws and regulations in detail. These
are of her own institution, and form
her ecclesiastical discipline. She can
revoke some, amend or alter others,
and add still others, as she judges
such action to be best adapted, under
the ever-varying circumstances of the
world, to secure the great end for
which she must ever labor&mdash;the salvation
of souls.</p>

<p>As in all previous councils, so in
this Vatican Council, these matters of
discipline have naturally and unavoidably
come up for consideration.</p>

<p>We said that, in the General Congregation,
held on the 14th of January,
immediately after the election of
which we have spoken, the discussion
of them commenced. It was continued
in other congregations held on
January 15th, 19th, 21st, 22d, 24th,
25th, 27th, 28th, 31st; February 3d,
4th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 14th, and 15th.
It is not yet closed. So far, ninety-five
prelates have addressed the council
on the various points of discipline
that came under examination.</p>

<p>If the discussion on matters of
faith, of which we spoke in our last
number, was worthy of admiration for
the vast learning it displayed, and the
intellectual powers of the speakers,
this one on discipline was even more
interesting for its practical bearing
and the personal experience, so to
speak, which it recorded. The questions
came up whether this or that
law of discipline, established eight
hundred or five hundred or three hundred
years ago, however wise and
efficacious at the period of its institution,
could now be looked on as sufficiently
accomplishing its original purpose;
or whether, on the contrary,
some new law, proposed for the consideration
of the prelates, might not
now be wisely substituted for it.
Bishops from every part of the world
brought the light of their own experience
to illustrate the subject. They
bore, as it were, personal testimony to
the good effects and to the inconveniences
of those rules and laws in
their respective dioceses. It was indeed
most touching; and it is said
that the assembly was moved to tears
as an eloquent bishop, burning with
zeal for the house of the Lord, told,
with accents of apostolic grief, of the
woes of religion, and of disorders that
almost broke his heart&mdash;disorders
against which he struggled, seemingly
in vain, because they arose from, or
were supported by, the intermeddling
and abuses, and tyranny of the civil
government, which claims to be "free
and progressive," but is ever grasping
at things ecclesiastical, ever striving
to wield ecclesiastical power, and at
times pretending to uphold and defend
such intrusion by pretext of the
laws and privileges of other times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
when rulers and people alike professed
to fear God and to respect his
church.</p>

<p>Every portion of the world was
heard from. The East, through
Chaldeans, Maronites, and Armenians.
The West, through Italian,
French, German, Hungarian, Spanish,
Mexican, Peruvian, Brazilian, English,
Irish, and American bishops.
The past was interrogated as to the
reasons and motives on which the
olden laws were based, and the special
purposes they were intended to
effect; and the present, as to their
actual observance and effects in this
century. Even the future was examined,
so far as men may look into it,
to conjecture what course the world
was taking; and what, on the other
hand, would be the most proper
course for the church to pursue in
her legislation, in order to secure the
fullest observance of the laws of God,
and the truest promotion of his glory.</p>

<p>We might well be assured that,
even humanly speaking, such abundance
of knowledge and experience,
such careful examination of all the
past and present bearings of the subjects,
such a keen, calm scrutiny of
the future, would secure to the church
from such men an ecclesiastical legislation
of the highest practical wisdom,
as well in what is retained as in what
is changed or added as new. But, as
Catholics, we should never lose sight
of that higher wisdom with which the
Holy Ghost, according to the words
of Christ, and in answer to the prayers
of the Catholic world, will not fail
to guide the fathers of the council.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>It will thus be seen that during this
month the council has steadily pursued
the even tenor of its way, without
any public session. In fact, no
day has as yet been assigned even as
the proximate date of the third public
session. No one outside the council
seems able to say precisely what progress
has been made in discussing and
disposing of matters. Still less can
we say when the council will close.
There seems to be a feeling that the
discussions will continue until June,
when the almost tropical heat of a
Roman summer must set in. This
will, of course, necessitate an adjournment
until the close of October, when
the bishops would probably reassemble
to continue their work. Time
only can show whether there is any
truth in this prognostication. Some
of the bishops, of a more practical
turn of mind, or more desirous of returning
soon to their dioceses, are
striving to find a mode of conciliating
the most perfect freedom of discussion
with a more rapid progress in the
matters before the council. The most
sacred right in a council is freedom to
state one's views on matters in controversy,
and to uphold them by all
the arguments in one's power. This
right has so far been most fully enjoyed
and freely used. No plan that
would take it away would be entertained.</p>

<p>Every day in Rome now convinces
a sojourner more and more strongly
of the unity, the catholicity, and the
sanctity of the church of Christ.
Faith that heretofore was almost extinct
beneath the ashes of worldly
thoughts, here glows again and bursts
into a bright flame. Elsewhere we
believed these truths; here we seem
to behold with our eyes, and to touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with our hands their reality. No one
can be privileged to mingle with the
bishops here without being impressed
with their perfect unity in all things
declared and taught by the church,
and with the undisguised readiness or
rather firm intention of all, to accept
and to hold and to teach all that, under
the light of the Holy Ghost, shall
be declared of faith in this Vatican
Council. If, during the discussion
and examination, they may take different
views, this does not disturb the
cordial affection among them. They
can array their strongest arguments
without ever descending to personalities.
They are chary of indulging
even in witticism calculated to relieve
the solemnity of the debate by a
smile. In all the discussion there is
not only the highest gentlemanly
courtesy, but also that true charity
and union of hearts which must accompany
that unity of faith which
they solemnly professed to hold, and
which must, if possible, be confirmed
and strengthened in this Vatican
Council.</p>

<p>To be fully impressed with this perfect
unity, one must be privileged to
mingle somewhat with the bishops.
But even the cursory glance of a
stranger sees the evidence of the catholicity
of the church presented by
the gathering of so many bishops
from so many portions of the world
around the central chair of unity.
We have already spoken of this in
our former articles. We will now
give a summary, almost official, which
has just been made out, classifying
the prelates who have attended, according
to their nationalities and
dioceses:</p>

<p>Truly, it is such a gathering as no
human power could assemble. Only
the Catholic Church could effect it.
No wonder that strangers from every
clime, especially devout Catholics,
have flocked to Rome these months
as they never flocked before.</p>

<p>The splendor of the ceremonies of
our holy church, as celebrated in
Rome, especially in St. Peter's, is unequalled
in the whole world. A gray-haired
ambassador was present some
years ago in St. Peter's at the celebration
of high mass by the sovereign
pontiff on Easter-Sunday. He had
been present at two imperial and several
royal coronations, where every
effort was made to give a national
magnificence to the ceremony; had
witnessed several royal marriages, and
grand court celebrations of every character.
But he declared that every
thing he had ever seen sank into insignificance
before the grandeur and
the sublime magnificence of that high
mass. Never were the religious celebrations
of Rome so magnificent as
they have been and are during this
council, when the sanctuary is filled
with more than half a thousand
prelates, Latin and oriental, in their
rich and varied vestments. Strangers
and Romans alike crowd the grand
basilica. Yet the stranger often fails
to see, what the Roman feels, as it
were, by instinct, that all this effort
at splendor and magnificence is purely
and wholly a tribute of man to
honor the religion which God in his
love and mercy has given, and that
no part of it is for man's own honor.
If the stranger would realize this
truth, which is the soul of the ceremonial
of the church, he has but to
follow these prelates from the sanctuary
to their homes, and witness the
simplicity and self-denial of their private
lives. Perhaps he will be shocked
at the unexpected discovery of
what he would term discomfort and
poverty.</p>

<p>In such personal simplicity and
self-denial the sovereign pontiff himself
gives the example in the Vatican.
The palace is large&mdash;very large; but
the libraries, the archives, the various
museums, and the galleries and halls
of paintings, of statuary, and of art,
occupy no small portion of it. Other
portions of it are devoted to the vast
workshops of the unrivalled Roman
mosaics, others still to the mint. The
offices of the secretary of state, and
the bureaus of other departments are
there. The Sixtine, and Pauline, and
other chapels are found in it; and
the various officers and attendants of
the court have many of them their
special apartments. The pontiff has
his suite of rooms, as well those of
state as those that are private. You
enter a large, well-proportioned hall,
rich with gilding and arabesque and
fresco paintings. A company of soldiers
might man&oelig;uvre on its marble
floor. It is large enough to receive
the fullest suite of a sovereign who
would visit the pope. Just now, eight
or ten soldiers in a rich military uniform
are lounging here, as it were, for
form's sake. In the next room&mdash;a
smaller and less ornamented one, yet
in something of the same style, and
with a few benches for furniture&mdash;a
servant will take your hat and cloak.
In a third room, you find some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
ecclesiastical attendants. You pass
through a fourth room of considerable
size. It is now empty. At times
a consistory or meeting of the cardinals
for business is held here; at other
times, an ascetic Capuchin father, with
his tonsured head, his long beard, his
coarse brown woollen cassock fastened
around the waist by a cord, and
with sandalled feet, preaches to the
cardinals and bishops and officials of
the court, and to the pope himself.
With the freedom and bravery of a
man who, to follow Christ, has given
up the world, and hopes for nothing
from man, and fears nothing save to
fail in his duty, he reminds those
whom men honor of their duties and
obligations, and in plain, ofttimes unvarnished
language, will not shrink
from speaking the sternest, strongest
home truths of religion. You pass
through the silent hall in reverence.
A fourth hall, with a better carpeting,
(for it is winter,) and tolerably warmed,
is the ante-chamber proper, where
those are waiting who are to be admitted
to an audience of the pope.
In another smaller room, opening
from this one, those are waiting whose
turn it will be to enter next; or perhaps
a group is assembled, if the pope
will come out hither to receive them,
as he sometimes does, when the audience
is simply one not of business,
but simply for the honor of being presented
to him and of receiving his
blessing. All these which we have
enumerated are the state or ceremonial
apartments. From the last one,
you pass to the private office or sitting-room
of the sovereign pontiff.
It is a plain room, about fifteen feet
by twenty, not lofty, lighted by a single
window, and without a fire-place.
Two or three devotional paintings
hang against the walls; a stand supports
a small and exquisitely chiselled
statue of the Blessed Virgin. At one
side of the room, on a slight platform,
is the pope's arm-chair, in which he
is seated, clothed in his white woollen
<i>soutane</i>. Before him is his large writing-table,
with well-filled drawers and
pigeon-holes. On it you see pens,
ink, sand, and paper, his breviary,
perhaps, and one or two volumes,
and an ivory crucifix. A small case
in the corner of the room contains
some other books, some objects of
<i>vertu</i>, medals, and such articles as he
designs to give as mementoes. There
is a thin carpet on the floor, and a
couple of plain wooden chairs are
near the table. Here Pius IX. ordinarily
spends many hours each day,
as hard worked as any bank clerk.
He is exceedingly regular in his habits.
He rises before five in summer,
at half-past five in winter. In half an
hour he passes to his private chapel
and gives an hour and a half to his
devotions, and to the celebration of
two masses; the first by himself, the
second by one of his chaplains. A
cup of chocolate and a small roll of
bread suffices for his breakfast. He
at once passes to his office, and works
for one hour alone and undisturbed.
Then commence the business audiences
of the heads or secretaries of
the various departments, civil and ecclesiastical;
a long and tedious work,
in which he gives a conscientious attention
to every detail. By half-past
eleven <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, he commences to receive
bishops and ecclesiastics or strangers
from abroad. This usually ends by
one <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, when he retires for his midday
devotions, and for his dinner, and
repose. This may be followed by
more work, alone in his office. At
half-past three in winter, at half-past
four in summer, if the weather allows
it, he gives an hour and a half to a
drive and a walk. Returning home,
he takes a slight repast, and again the
audiences for business or for strangers
commence, and last until after eight.
At nine punctually he retires, to commence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
again the same routine the
next day. Such are his regular days.
At other times he must be in church,
or must visit one institution or establishment
or another in the city, spend
an hour or two in ceremony or business,
and hurry home. Near this
sitting-room is a smaller room where
he takes his meals alone; for the pope
neither gives nor accepts entertainments.
His table does not cost more
than thirty cents a day. Not far
off is his sleeping chamber, small
as the other, with a narrow bed and
hard couch. Truly, his is no life of
ease and pampered indulgence. There
is a stern meaning in his title, <i>Servant
of the Servants of God</i>.</p>

<p>The same simplicity and austereness
marks the private life of the cardinals.
There is now, indeed, an
outward show, for they rank as princes
of the blood royal. There are the
richly-ornamented carriages drawn by
brilliantly-harnessed horses, and attended
by servants in livery. There
are the decorated state ante-chambers
and halls. All these things are for
the public, and are prescribed by rule.
If a cardinal has not himself the means
to support them, he would be entitled
to a state salary for the purpose of
keeping them up. But back of all
these may be found a plain, almost
unfurnished room, in which he studies
and writes, and a bed-chamber&mdash;we
have seen some not ten feet by twelve,
carpetless and fireless. Oftentimes,
too, the cardinal lives in the religious
house of some community, and then
much of the state can be dispensed
with. But for the red calotte which
he wears on his head, you often could
not distinguish him from the other
clergymen in the establishment.</p>

<p>The same spirit seems to characterize
the bishops who are now gathered
together in Rome. All their
splendor is in the church and for religion.
In their private life they certainly
do not belong to that class of
strangers from whose lavish expenditures
in fashionable life the Romans
will reap a rich harvest. They live
together in groups, mostly in religious
houses or colleges, or in apartments,
which several club together to take
at moderate rates. Thus the Chaldean
patriarch, a venerable, white-bearded
prelate, near eighty years of
age, with the other bishops of his rite,
and their attendant priests, all live
together in one monastery, not far
from St. Peter's. Whatever the weather,
they go on foot in their oriental
dress to the council, and when the
meeting is over, return on foot. Their
stately, oriental walk, their calm,
thoughtful countenances, the colored
turbans on their heads, the mixture
of purple and black and green and
red, in their flowing robes, set off by
the gold of their massive episcopal
chains, and their rich crosses sparkling
with diamonds, never fail to attract
attention. But one should see
them in their home, which they have
made as Eastern as they could. The
orientals are exceedingly temperate
in their meals, and as regards wine,
are almost "teetotalers." But they
do love to smoke. As the visitor is
ushered into a room, where the only
piece of furniture is a broad cushioned
seat running round along the walls,
on which are seated a dozen or more
of long-bearded men, their feet gathered
up under them in oriental fashion,
and each one smoking a pipe a yard
long, and filling the atmosphere with
the clouds of Latakia, he almost thinks
himself in Mossoul. The pipes are
gravely withdrawn on his entrance,
that the right hand may go to the
forehead, and the heads may bow.
The welcome, <i>schalom</i>, "peace," is
gravely spoken, with perhaps a smile.
He takes a seat on the divan and is
asked to take a pipe, if so minded.
From time to time, the silence is interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
by some remark in a full,
sedate voice, and intensely guttural
words of Chaldee or Arabic, whether
on the last debate of the council or
on some new phase of the Eastern
question, it is probable the visitor will
never learn. But he has caught a
glimpse of quiet Chaldean life. Fourteen
or fifteen of the Armenian prelates,
with their patriarch, live in a
not very dissimilar manner. But the
Armenians are much more akin to
Europeans in their education and character
of thought. They are good
linguists. All of them speak Italian
fluently, many of them French, and
some a little English. Their society
is agreeable and instructive, and is
much sought.</p>

<p>In like manner eighteen of the
American bishops are domiciled in
the American College. Some others
are with the Lazarists at their mother
house, others again are at St. Bridget's
or St. Bartholomew's, or with the
Dominicans. Those that have taken
apartments have contrived with a
very few exceptions to live together
in groups. The English, the Irish,
in fact, nearly all the bishops, have
followed the same plan. Some
laughingly say that their college days
have come back to them, with their
regularity and their accommodations.
But these are not quite as agreeable
at fifty or sixty as they were at the
age of twenty. Yet all feel, and none
more thoroughly than the bishops
themselves, that this life of comparative
retirement, of quiet and study,
and of continued and closest intercourse
with each other, must tend to
prepare them, and to qualify them for
the great work on which they are engaged.</p>

<p>Another special feature of Rome in
this season, dependent on the council,
is the frequency of sermons in various
languages, and of various religious
services in the churches.
Rome as the centre of Catholicity is
never without a certain number of
clergymen from every nation of Europe.
Each winter, too, sees thousands
of visitors, Catholics, Protestants, and
unbelievers, crowding her streets,
drawn hither by motives of religion,
of science, of curiosity, or of fashion.
It was natural that visitors should be
enabled to listen to the truths of our
holy religion preached in their own
languages. This year it could be
done much more fully, and the opportunity
has not been allowed to
pass by unregarded. For example,
"The Pious Society for Missions," an
excellent community of priests, established
in this city over thirty years
ago by the saintly Abbate Pallotta,
has the custom of celebrating the festival
and octave of Epiphany each
year by appropriate religious exercises,
and introducing sermons in several
languages. This year they selected
the larger and noble church of San
Andrea della Valle, and continued
their exercises for eleven days. The
following was the programme which
they followed: At 5.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, mass;
at 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, Italian sermon and benediction;
at 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, high mass of the
Latin rite; at 10 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, high mass in
an oriental rite, (Armenian, Greek,
Copt, Chaldean, Roumenian, Melchite,
Bulgarian, Maronite, Armenian
again, Syrian, Ambrosian;) at 11
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, a sermon in some foreign language&mdash;that
is, Polish once, German
twice, Spanish twice, English six
times, (Archbishop Spalding, Father
Hecker, and Bishop McGill, Bishop
Moriarty of Kerry, Bishop Ullathorne,
and Archbishop Manning
were the English preachers.) At
1.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> each day, a French sermon
by a bishop; at 3.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, an Italian
sermon and benediction; at 6
<span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, another sermon in Italian with
benediction. The sermons were all,
of course, of a high order of merit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
The church was crowded morning,
forenoon, afternoon, and evening.</p>

<p>French sermons have been continued
ever since, mostly by the eloquent
Bishop Mermillod, of Geneva,
and English sermons on Sundays and
Wednesdays by F. Burke, an eloquent
Dominican of St. Clement's,
and by Monsignor Capel. During
Lent there will be an additional series
of English sermons, to be delivered
by the American bishops.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January, the American
episcopate and the American
College received from the Holy Father
a very signal and agreeable mark
of his good will. It was meant, one
might almost think, as a return visit
on his part, in the only way which
court etiquette allows. He chose the
church of the college as the place
where he would pronounce a decree
in the cause of the venerable servant
of God, John Juvenal Ancina, Bishop
of Saluzzo, in Northern Italy. In
that church he would, of course, be
surrounded by the American prelates,
priests, and students, and from the
church would pass to the college.</p>

<p>John Juvenal Ancina was born in
Fossano, in Piedmont, in 1545. Having
finished his course of collegiate
studies, he graduated in medicine, and
for years practised that profession
with great ability, and greater charity
toward the poor, to whom he devoted
himself. In course of time he
lost every near relation except one
brother. Both determined with common
accord to enter the sanctuary,
and came to Rome for that purpose,
and there joined the Oratorians under
St. Philip Neri. John spent years in
the priesthood, honored for his learning,
and still more for his piety and
sweetness, and zeal in the ministry,
which he exercised in Rome, in Naples,
and in Turin. Much against
his will, and only after repeated injunctions
from the pope, he was forced
to accept the charge of the diocese
of Saluzzo. He had been the intimate
and dear friend of St. Francis
de Sales for years of his priesthood,
and their friendship continued until
the close of his short and fruitful episcopacy.
He died in 1604, and St.
Francis preached his funeral eulogy.
He is the one with whom the saint
had the oft-cited exchange of puns
complimentary, "Tu vere <i>Sal es</i>."
"Immo, tu <i>Sal</i> et <i>Lux</i>." The reputation
of the virtues of such a man
could not die with him. Not long
after his death, the episcopal authority
of Saluzzo allowed and directed
that full testimony should be taken
under oath, from those who lived with
him and knew him well, as to the
truth of his holy life. This was fully
and searchingly done throughout the
diocess of Saluzzo. Similar investigations
were instituted, under similar
authority, in Rome, in Naples, and
in Turin, where at different times he
had lived, and wherever such testimony
could be found. The original
depositions&mdash;and they are a large
mass, and are still extant&mdash;were sent
to Rome. The pontiff directed that
they should be laid before the proper
tribunal&mdash;the Congregation of Rites.
They were found to fulfil the requirements
of the canons, and to present
such a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primÃ¢ facie</i> case as would authorize
that congregation to proceed.
This meant that, after a certain lapse
of time, during which affection and
human feelings might die out, and
any hidden truth might work its way
to the light, the congregation should
go over the ground a second time,
taking through other persons a second
and independent mass of testimony.
This was done, and its results were
compared with those of the first mass
of testimony. There was no contradiction;
but on the contrary, full and
ample confirmation. Still, the opinion
and belief of the witnesses was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
not yet deemed of itself sufficient.
Taking the facts of his life, his words
and writings, and acts and habits, as
they were thus proved, they were all
studied out and carefully weighed in
the scales of the sanctuary. There
was no hurry&mdash;there never is at
Rome, as this council fully shows&mdash;and
the decision of the congregation
was not given until the year 1767.
Then came many political vicissitudes;
first of northern Italy, as it passed
from the domination of one power to
that of another, and later, the convulsions
of all Europe consequent on
the French revolution. The whole
matter slumbered until 1855, when it
was again taken up. The examination
of the life and acts was gone
over again as before. Step by step
matters advanced until last November,
at a general meeting of the Congregation
of Rites, held in the presence
of his holiness, it was decided
<i>That the servant of God, John Juvenal
Ancina, had in his lifetime practised
the theological virtues of faith, hope,
and charity, toward God and his neighbor,
and the cardinal virtues of prudence,
justice, fortitude, and temperance,
and their accessory virtues, in an heroic
degree</i>. It was to announce this decision,
in a formal decree, that the
pontiff came on the 29th January, the
festival of St. Francis de Sales, to the
church of the American College. He
arrived at ten <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, and was received
at the portal of the college by the
rector of the college, and all the American
bishops now at Rome, and by
a dozen others, Irish, English, Scotch,
and Italian. He proceeded at once
to the church, which, though small, is
one of the handsomest in Rome for
its beautiful marbles and fine statuary.
The pontiff knelt, while one of
his chaplains celebrated mass. The
bishops, all the American priests in
the city, the students of the college,
and many Catholics from the United
States, and some other strangers, filled
the little church. After the mass,
the pontiff ascended to the throne
prepared for him. Cardinal Patrizi,
prefect of the Congregation of Rites
Cardinal Capalti, who had special
charge of this case, and Cardinal BarnabÃ²,
protector of the college, stood
next to him. The formal decree was
read, proclaiming the decision in virtue
of which we shall henceforth say,
"<i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Venerable</span> <i>John Juvenal
Ancina</i>."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The superior general of the
Oratorians, to which community, as
we have said, he belonged, returned
thanks in an eloquent and brief discourse
in Latin. The pope then, taking
his theme from the life of the
<span class="smcap">VENERABLE</span> bishop, addressed to the
prelates present a short and feeling
discourse, in Italian, on the character
and virtues which should adorn a bishop.
Though he did not mention
the council, it was evident that the
thought of it filled his heart. He
spoke of the servant of God whom
he had just declared venerable as imitating
the apostles. They, from being
fishermen, were called to be fishers
of men; and he too, from being a
physician of the body, was called to
be a physician of souls. This holy
man he showed to be a model of bishops,
and enlarged on the text of
St. Gregory the Great, that a bishop
should be "in thought, pure; in
deeds, eminent; in silence, discreet;
in word, useful; in the contemplation
of heavenly things, elevated." "Who
will ascend to the mountain of the
Lord? Let him be of pure hands
and clean heart." Let him be single-minded,
doing every thing for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>glory of God, without any admixture
of human motives. Let him be first
in all good works, so as to be a pattern
to his flock. He did not speak
of that silence which means cowardice,
or indifference to whatever evil
goes on in the world. There is a
time to speak, as well as a time to
be silent. The bishop must be useful
in words, speaking out boldly
whenever it is for the advantage of
the Christian people. He must be a
man of prayer. What is the origin
of the evils which we see in the
world? The prophet answers, "Because
there is no one who thinketh in
his heart." The pontiff dwelt for a
few moments on all these points, and
in conclusion quoted St. Gregory
again, who said, "I have given you
a beautiful picture of a bishop, though
the painter be bad." "What the
saint says out of humility, I must
say," he added, "of myself in truth.
But pray for me that God may give
me strength to bear the heavy weight
he has laid upon me. Let us pray
for each other. Do you pray for me;
and I call on the Almighty to bless
you, and your dioceses, and your
people."</p>

<p>The words of the pontiff were simple,
because full of devotion and truth;
and the delivery was exquisitely perfect,
in the earnest, heart-felt, subdued
tones of his voice, and the chaste dignity
of his gesture. All felt that the
pontiff spoke from his paternal heart.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Saluzzo, the successor
in this century of the <span class="smcap">VENERABLE</span>
<i>Ancina</i>, returned thanks; and all proceeded
from the church to the grand
hall of the college. The cloister of
the court-yard and the broad stairways
and corridors were adorned with
drapery, tapestry, and evergreens. A
splendid life-size portrait of his holiness,
just painted by the American
artist, Healy, for the exhibition about
to be opened, had been sent to the
college for the occasion, and was
placed in a prominent position. In
the hall, the pontiff again spoke a few
kind and paternal words, and Archbishop
Spalding, in the name of the
American church, clergy and laity,
made an address to the pope in Latin.
The discourse was excellent in
language and happy in thought. His
grace referred to the fact that Pius VI.
had given us our first bishop, (Dr.
Carroll, of Baltimore;) Pius VII. had
multiplied dioceses, and given us our
first archiepiscopal see; and he, Pius
IX., had established six other archiepiscopal
sees. So that in a country
where sixty years ago there was but
one bishop, there are now sixty, three
fourths of whom are here in Rome
to attend the general council. Toward
the end of his discourse, the
good archbishop brought in a few
touches of true American wit. This
is what Italians would scarcely venture
on, on such an occasion, and it
was to them unexpected. Even the
pope looked for a moment puzzled,
as if he could not conjecture what
was coming; but as he caught the
point, a smile spread over his countenance,
and the smile developed into
a hearty laugh. As for the Italian
prelates, at first they wondered&mdash;as
who would not, at an American joke
in the language of Cicero?&mdash;but at
last not all their stately dignity could
resist its force, and they laugh yet, as
they repeat it.</p>

<p>The bishops, the superiors, and students
of the college, the priests who
were present, and the laity, approached
to offer their homage to the pontiff
and receive his blessing. This
over, he departed, but not until he
had declared that he was delighted,
more than delighted, with his visit.</p>

<h2>FOREIGN LITERARY NOTES.</h2>


<p>For the sake of making a point against
the Catholic Church, Protestants and
indifferents are frequently so poverty-stricken
in authorities as to quote Voltaire.
When told that they cite the authority
of a man who was unprincipled,
cynical, and impious, they answer that
such an estimate is simply the result of
a bigoted and narrow-minded prejudice,
and that the great French philosopher
was liberal, honorable, and conscientious.</p>

<p>An incident has lately occurred in
France to call forth the deliberate opinion
of a body of men eminently fitted
from superior education, elevated position,
and freedom from any possible
suspicion of Catholic bias, to form an
estimate which to our friends above
referred to must be looked upon as authoritative
and decisive, although open
to the objection of being too mild and
qualified.</p>

<p>Some fifteen years ago, a proposition
was started in a Paris daily newspaper
for the popular collection, in
small sums, of a sufficient amount to
erect a statue to Voltaire in the French
capital. When the success of the subscription
seemed sufficiently assured,
petition was made to the government
to grant a site on some public square on
which to place the statue. After long
delay, and some appearance of unwillingness,
the petition was finally granted;
but the announcement of this fact was
immediately followed by the presentation
of a large number of protests against
the erection of the statue, which came
in from all parts of the empire. One of
these protests, signed by a thousand inhabitants
of the departments of Le Gard
and the DrÃ´me, and the city of NÃ®smes,
and addressed to the senate, was referred
to a committee of senators for consideration
and report. The committee
has made a report, which is understood
to be written by M. Silvestre de Sacy,
well known as former chief editor of the
<cite>Journal des DÃ©bats</cite>, and a distinguished
member of the French Academy.
From it we learn something of the petition,
but not as much as we would like
to know. After a recital of the facts we
have stated, the report goes on to say:
Undoubtedly, the government had authority
to refuse the permission asked,
and still has the power to withdraw it.
The right of private persons to award
statues to whomsoever they please, and
to meet and raise money to pay for them,
is certainly lawful. But the public streets
and squares are not their property. The
number of these persons does not increase
their right. They act, in such a
matter, solely for themselves, and not
for the whole country, of which they
have no right to pretend to be the representatives.
Among the serious considerations
which might have made the
government hesitate, is the very name
Voltaire, which has two significations:
the one glorious for the human intellect
and for French literature; the other for
which Voltaire himself would now blush,
dragging down as it does the great historian
and great poet to the miserable
calling of an impious and cynical pamphleteer.
But it appears that the subscribers
have obtained the permission
asked for. The site has been selected,
and the statue will be erected in one of
the squares of the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de Rennes</i>.
The petition before us protests against
this permission, and prays the intervention
of the senate with the government
to obtain the withdrawal of a permission
which it characterizes in the strongest
terms. These petitioners see but one
Voltaire&mdash;an impious, immoral Voltaire,
hostile to all religion; a Voltaire who
conspired with all the enemies of France
for the humiliation and ruin of his country;
a Voltaire who, Prussian at Rosbach
with King Frederick, Russian
with Catherine II., against unfortunate
Poland, the violator of our purest
glory in his poem <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jeanne d'Arc</i>,
the enemy of liberty, equality, and fraternity,
as may be shown from a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
passages in his correspondence
and writings, an abject courtier and a
servile adulator of kings. "I ask," says
the first petitioner, speaking for all the
others&mdash;"I ask that the image of this
man shall not appear upon our public
squares, to cast insult in the face of the
country. I ask that this disgrace be
spared France." The senatorial report
then goes on to say that there are two
Voltaires&mdash;the Voltaire described in the
petition, and the Voltaire who wrote
<cite>La Henriade</cite>, who, by various masterpieces
in poetry and the drama, placed
himself near Horace, Corneille, and
Boileau; Voltaire the historian, to
whom we are indebted for <cite>Le SiÃ¨cle de
Louis XIV.</cite>, the essay <cite>Sur l'Esprit et
sur les M&oelig;urs des Nations</cite>, and that
perfect model of rapid and lively narration,
<cite>L'Histoire de Charles XII.</cite>; the
Voltaire, in fine, whose name could not
be covered with oblivion without obscuring
some of the glories of French
literature. No, continues the report,
whatever may be asserted to the contrary,
all of Voltaire is not in some
shafts of satire which fell from the ill-humor
of the partisan and the angry
writer, in pamphlets against religion, as
poor in good taste and good sense as in
true science, in a poem in which it is
most sad to see wit and talent pressed
into the disreputable service of ornamenting
the wretched obscenity of the
argument; all of Voltaire is not in single
passages selected from a correspondence
of sixty years. If in these were
the whole of Voltaire, his memory would
long since have been accursed or dead,
his works long since have been without
readers or publishers, and the idea of raising
a statue in his honor would have occurred
to no one. Although the avowal
is a painful one, it must be confessed
that Voltaire has himself and the deplorable
errors of his genius alone to
blame for the bitterness of the recriminations
which injure his brilliant fame.
He has too often been unjust to others
not to expect that others should be
unjust to him. It is his own fault if his
name recalls to pious thinkers, to timid
hearts, to the faith of ardent souls, only
the writer who would not respect in others
the noble hopes he himself had lost.
Voltaire desired to be the leader of incredulity.
He was; and now he pays
the penalty for it. Something equivocal
remains, and will ever remain associated
with his fame. Respectable people
can consent to award him eulogies and
statues only with distinctions and reserves.
The declared enemy of disorder
and demagogism, he is sometimes invoked
as a seditious tribune, as a burner
of churches; and one of the most
elegant minds has left in his writings,
along with a great many marvellous
works, food for passions which, in his
better days, his good taste and his good
sense would energetically condemn.
The report concludes against asking the
revocation of the permission granted by
the government, on the ground that it
will be understood by all that the honor
of a statue is conceded not to the Voltaire
with reason petitioned against, but to
the author whose works are subjects of
legitimate national pride.</p>

<p>In the year 400, a Buddhist priest,
Fah-Hian, commenced the long journey
from China to India and back, and left
a narrative of his travels. A century
later, a similar journey was made by
another Buddhist priest, Sung-Yun,
who also left an account of his foreign
experiences. Singularly enough, these
works have survived all these centuries,
and have long been objects of great interest
to the oriental scholars of Europe.
Remusat and Klaproth published a
translation of Fah-Hian at Paris in
1836. This work, in quarto, was soon
followed by an English translation by
Laidley. Many serious errors, especially
in geography, were pointed out in
these translations by St. Julien, and
Professor Neumann also gave a translation
of the two Buddhist works, in the
<cite>Zeitschrift fÃ¼r historische Theologie</cite>,
vol. iii., 1833. Meantime, additional
light had been thrown upon the subject
by such publications as Edkin's Notice
of Buddhism in China, and General
Cunningham's work; and a full and
amended version of the Buddhist
priests' travels, together with an interesting
treatise on Buddhism, is now
published in London by TrÃ¼bner &amp; Co.
Its title is, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span><cite>Travels of Fah-Hian and

an Attempt to estimate their Historic
and Dogmatic Worth.</cite> By R. Sinker,
M.A., Chaplain of Trinity College.
Cambridge: Deighton, Bell. London:
Bell &amp; Daldy. 1869.</p>

<p>An elegant edition of this apocryphal
work, carefully revised and annotated
from manuscripts preserved at Cambridge
and Oxford, with a learned and
judicious treatise. Ecclesiastical antiquity
has left us but little positive information
concerning these testaments.
We are certain that the testaments of the
twelve patriarchs were known to Tertullian
and to Origen, but we do not
know who wrote them. Was the author
a Jew, a Christian from among the Gentiles,
or a Christian of Jewish race?
Was he an Ebionite or a Nazarene?
Is the work all from one hand, or is it
interpolated? On all these points there
is a difference of opinion. Equally in
doubt are the points, When was the
book written? for what class of readers
was it specially intended? and
what was the author's object in writing
it? Mr. Sinker discusses the subject
with great firmness, and concludes, but
without any dogmatism, that the author
was a Jewish Christian of the sect of the
Nazarenes, and that the work was composed
at a period between the taking of
Jerusalem by Titus and the revolt of
the Jew Barcochba in 135. One of the
most important portions of Mr. Sinker's
work is on the <i>Christology</i> of the
Testaments, (pages 88-116.) He is satisfied
that the author expresses his belief
in the mystery of the incarnation, and
he sets forth the doctrine of the Testaments
on the Messiah, king and pontiff,
descendant of Juda and Levi, priest and
victim, Lamb of God, Saviour of the
world, etc. etc. The work really merits
a longer notice, and should be in the
hands of all who can profit by its perusal.
Many important questions concerning
the primitive history of Christianity, obscured
by the fallacious conjectures of
anti-Christian critics, may have much
light thrown upon them.</p>

<p>Some of the English periodicals are
not especially brilliant or profound in
their appreciation of and comments
upon foreign literature. Take the London
<cite>AthenÃ¦um</cite>, for instance, the same
periodical which last year approved
with such an air of wisdom the author
who undertook to revive the old exploded
fable of a female pope. It informs
its readers, (number of 6th November
last,) "The Man with the Iron
Mask continues to occupy the learned
in search of problematical questions.
M. Marius Topin has come to the conclusion
that Lauzun was the man. We
believe this theory has already been advocated."
Now, from the most superficial
reading of M. Topin's work, (provided
the reader knows a little more
French than the <cite>AthenÃ¦um</cite>,) it is perfectly
clear that, although M. Topin
speaks of Lauzun as a prisoner at Pignerol,
he expressly says that it is impossible
to think seriously of him as a
candidate for the iron mask, for the
simple reason that Lauzun was set at
liberty some years before the death of
the masked prisoner.</p>

<p>Two distinguished Catholic artists

graceful and inspired religious
compositions are too well-known to need
comment here. Tenerani was a pupil of
Canova and of Thorwaldsen. His "Descent

to the Corinthians.</cite> A revised Text,
with Introduction and Notes, by J. B.
Lightfoot, D.D., Hulsean Professor of
Divinity and Fellow of Trinity College,
Cambridge. London: Macmillan. 1869.
8vo. Professor Lightfoot appears to
have suspended the publication of his
commentaries on the epistles of St. Paul,
and to have taken up the apostolic
fathers. The first epistle of St. Clement,
addressed to the Corinthians, is of well-settled
authenticity from the testimony
of Hermas, Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth,
Hegesippus, (cited by Eusebius,
iv. 22,) and numerous others. Although
not classed among the canonical books,
this epistle has always been highly
prized as what may be called a liturgical
document. St. Jerome bears testimony
that it was read publicly in the churches,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in nonnullis locis publice legitur</i>.) So
also does Eusebius. Dr. Lightfoot's
task is well performed. In his preface
he develops the statements above mentioned,
enumerates the various writings
ascribed to St. Clement of Rome, and
in speaking of the <i>recognitiones</i>, relates
the history of the false decretals. In
this work, as in many others on very
ancient manuscripts, the art of topography
has been of the greatest service.
The codex from which these two epistles
of St. Clement are taken, is the celebrated
one presented by Cyril Lucar to
Charles I., and now preserved in the
British Museum. The authorities of the
museum had it carefully photographed,
so that the author could make use of it at
his own pleasure, and at his own house,
as, of course, no such manuscript would
be allowed to leave the museum even
for an hour. A second volume of this
work of Professor Lightfoot is promised,
which will contain the epistles of St. Ignatius
and St. Polycarp.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Conversations on Liberalism and
the Church.</span> By O. A. Brownson,
LL.D. New York: D. &amp; J. Sadlier
&amp; Co.</p>

<p>This is the first production of the pen
of Dr. Brownson which has appeared
under his own name for several years.
During this time he has been a constant
contributor to this magazine, and has
furnished a considerable number of
valuable articles to other periodicals,
particularly the <cite>Tablet</cite>, of which he has
for some time past had the principal
editorial charge. Those who are familiar
with the leonine style of the great
publicist cannot have failed to recognize
it even in his anonymous productions,
or to admit, whether with good or
with ill grace, that he still remains <i>facile
princeps</i> in that high domain which he
has chosen for himself. We welcome
the venerable author most heartily on
his reappearance upon the field of intellectual
combat with his visor up, and
his own avowed recognizance upon his
shield. He appears as the champion
of the encyclical of Pius IX. against
that conglomeration of absurd and destructive
errors which its advocates have
decorated with the name of liberalism,
and as the defender of the true, genuine
principles of liberty&mdash;that liberty which
Catholic training and Christian civilization
prepare the greatest possible number
of men to enjoy, to the greatest possible
extent, with the least possible
danger to themselves and society.</p>

<p>The volume is small in size, but
weighty and precious in matter, like a
lump of gold. There is enough precious
metal in it to keep an ordinary
review-writer a-going for three years.
The wretched, flimsy sophistries and
falsehoods with which we are bored to
death every day by the writers for the
daily papers, screaming like macaws the
few changes of their scanty vocabulary,
Railroads, railroads! progress, progress!
mediÃ¦val fossil! nineteenth century!
are all summed up by Dr. Brownson in
a few sentences much better than one of
themselves can do it. These expressions
of the maxims of our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i>
liberal editors are put into the mouth of
an imaginary representative of the class,
who is supposed to be conversing with a
Catholic priest at an unfashionable watering-place.
The author, by the mouth
of the priest, answers him fully, and
makes an exposition of his own views
and opinions. The editor has nothing
to say in rejoinder, except to repeat
over his tiresome, oft-refuted platitudes,
ignoring all his antagonist has alleged
and proved against him. Perhaps it
will be said that the doctor has purposely
put a weak defence into the editor's
mouth. Not at all. It is no sport to
such an expert swordsman to run a tilt
against any but an expert and doughty
antagonist. Give him his choice, and he
would prefer to contend with one who
would make the best possible fight for
liberalism. In this case, as the doctor
has been obliged to play both sides of
the game, one hand against the other,
he has carefully avoided the common
fault of collusion between the right and
left hand. He has made his imaginary
editor say all that the real editors can
say, and in better fashion than they can
say it. Any person who has taken the
trouble to read the comments of the
writers for the press on the massive arguments
of Dr. Brownson's articles, or
their other lucubrations on the subjects
treated in this book, will perceive that
its author has not diluted them at all,
but has rather infused some of his own
strong tea into their tepid dish-water.</p>

<p>The errors of the liberalists have been
to a certain extent already discussed in
our pages, and will be probably discussed
more fully and to greater advantage
after the decrees of the Council of
the Vatican are published.</p>

<p>We therefore confine ourselves at
present to a particular notice of one
point only in Dr. Brownson's argument,
to which we desire to call special attention.
We allude to his exposition of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
views in regard to the relation of the
Catholic religion to the principles of the
American constitution. Dr. Brownson
is a thorough Catholic and a thorough
American. As a Catholic, he condemns
all the errors condemned by the syllabus
of Pius IX. As an American, he accepts
all the principles of the constitution
of the United States. As a philosopher,
he reconciles and harmonizes the
two documents of the ecclesiastical and
political sovereignties to which he owes
allegiance. If he were wavering or dubious
in obeying the instructions of the
encyclical, his exposition of the relation
between Catholic and American principles
would have no weight whatever; for
it would be merely an exposition of his
own private version of Catholicity and
not of the authorized version. If he
were not thoroughly American, his exposition
of the Catholic's ideal conception
of the relations of the church and
civil society might be very perfect, but
it would rather confirm than shake the
common persuasion that there is a contrariety
between the principles of our
political order and those of the Catholic
Church. If he were not a philosopher,
he might present both his religious and
his political doctrines, separately, in
such a way as to satisfy the claims both
of orthodoxy and of patriotism; but he
would not be able to show how these
two hemispheres can be joined together
in a complete whole. It is one of his
greatest merits that he is perpetually
aiming at the construction of these synthetic
harmonies of what we may call, for
the sake of the figure, the different gospels
of truth, and is perpetually approximating
nearer and nearer to that success
which perhaps cannot be fully achieved
by any human intellect. We think he
has substantially succeeded in the task
undertaken in the present volume, and
we commend it to the perusal of all
Americans, whether Catholics or non-Catholics,
in the hope that it may
strengthen both in the determination to
do no injustice to each other, and to remain
always faithful to the allegiance we
owe to the American republic. We
recommend it also to Dr. Brownson's
numerous admirers and friends in Europe
as a valuable aid to the understanding
of what are commonly called
American principles.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The End of the World, and the
Day of Judgment.</span> Two Discourses
preached to the Music Hall
Society, by their minister, the Rev.
William Rounseville Alger. Published
by request. Boston: Roberts
Brothers.</p>

<p>Considering what are the contents of
these "discourses," for which, naturally,
the preacher failed to find any text,
their title seems like a dismal jest.
There is nothing, however, too absurd
for the Music Hall of Boston, not even
the amalgamation of puritanism and
pantheism. We have two palmary objections
to the argument of these discourses,
which is, of course, intended to
disprove the Christian doctrine respecting
the last judgment and the end of the
world. The first is, the boundless credulity
which underlies the whole series
of assumptions on which it is founded;
the second is, its total want of scientific
method and accuracy. Mr. Alger
has an extensive knowledge of certain
departments of literature, a vivid imagination,
a certain nobleness of sentiment,
and a considerable power of graphic
delineation and combination of his
intellectual conceptions; but no logic or
philosophy, very little discriminative or
analytic skill, and nothing of the judicial
faculty. Wherever his imagination
leads, his intellect follows, and willingly
lends itself to clothe all the visions which
are met with on the aerial journey with
the garb of real and rational discoveries.
Therefore, we say that his argument in
these discourses rests on credulity, a
basis of vapor, like that which supports
a castle in the clouds. We proceed to
give some instances. Mr. Alger has
fashioned to himself a conception of
what our Lord Jesus Christ ought to
have been, and ought to have said and
done. Throughout these discourses,
and his other works, he explains every
thing recorded of the sayings and doings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of our divine Lord in the New Testament
according to this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ã  priori</i> conception
of his own, without regard to common
sense or sound criticism. This is
credulity, and nothing more. As well
might we say, Mr. Alger is a man of
sense and honesty, and therefore he can
never have meant any of the absurd
things he seems to say against the
Catholic doctrine. Another extraordinary
instance of credulity is the theory
of accounting for the similarity to the
principal Catholic dogmas which is seen
in the religious beliefs of heathen nations.
It is a fanciful conjecture, and,
as a philosophical theory, untenable,
that the same myths had an independent
origin and development among
distinct races. There must have been
a common cause and origin of religious
traditions, as well as of languages. Another
instance of credulity is found in the
following passage: "It is confidently
believed that within twenty years the
views adopted in the present writing
will be established beyond all cavil
from any fair-minded critic." Here is
a heavy strain indeed on our faith,
worse than that which Moses makes
upon poor Colenso! Worse than all is
the following, which we will not credit
to the author's credulity any further
than he himself warrants us in doing by
his own language, which we will quote
entire, that the reader may judge for
himself of the extent to which it shows
in the author a <i>penchant</i> for the marvellous,
provided that the marvellous is
in no way connected with revelation.
"A brilliant French writer has suggested
that even if the natural course of
evolution does of itself necessitate the
final destruction of the world, yet our
race, judging from the magnificent
achievements of science and art already
reached, may, within ten thousand
centuries, which will be long before the
foreseen end approaches, obtain such a
knowledge and control of the forces of
nature as to make collective humanity
master of this planet, able to shape and
guide its destinies, ward off every fatal
crisis, and perfect and immortalize the
system as now sustained. It is an audacious
fancy. But, like many other
incredible conceptions which have forerun
their own still more incredible fulfilment,
the very thought electrifies us
with hope and courage." (P. 18.)</p>

<p>This is indeed brilliant! It surpasses
the famous moon-hoax of Mr. Locke,
and the balloon-voyages of that wild
genius Edgar A. Poe, from whom we
have some recent and interesting intelligence,
contained in a volume which we
recommend to the congregation of Music
Hall; the volume being entitled
<cite>Strange Visitors, by a Clairvoyant</cite>.
In those days, probably, our Congress
will have a committee on comets, and
make appropriations for a railroad to
the Dog-star.</p>

<p>The second objection to Mr. Alger's
argument runs partly into the first. It
is, we have said, totally wanting in scientific
method and accuracy. This is
true of the entire process by which the
thesis of the discourses is sustained.
This thesis is, that the present constitution
of the world and the human race
will endure for ever, or at least for an indefinitely
long period. If there were no
light to be had on this point except the
light of nature, the opinion maintained
by the author would be at best only a
conjecture. It could not be made even
solidly probable, unless some rational
theory were first established concerning
the ultimate destiny of the human race,
and the end for which the present miserably
imperfect constitution of the world
had been decreed by the Creator, and
the perpetuity of the existing order on
the earth were shown to have a reason
in this final cause of man's creation.
The author has not done this, and we
do not believe that it is possible to do
it, even prescinding all question of revelation.
Even on scientific grounds&mdash;that
is, reasoning from all the analogies
known to us, and from purely rational
and philosophical data&mdash;it is far more
probable and reasonable to suppose that
the present state of the world is merely
preparatory to a far higher and more
perfect state, and will be swept away to
make place for it. But when we consider
the universality and antiquity of
this latter belief, and the solid mountain
of historical, miraculous, and moral evidence
on which rests the demonstration
that this belief proceeds from a divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
revelation, it is the most unscientific
method that can be conceived to ignore
it, or leap over it by the aid of fanciful
hypotheses, as Mr. Alger does. The
manner in which the Catholic doctrine
is distorted and misrepresented, in extremely
bad rhetoric, is also unscientific.
Nearly all the pith of this so-called
argument consists in a violent invective
against the notion of a partial, unjust,
vindictive Divinity, who rewards and
punishes like an ambitious tyrant, without
regard to necessary and eternal
principles of truth, right, and moral laws.
So far as this invective is directed against
Calvinism, considered in its logical entity,
and apart from the correctives of
common sense and sound moral sentiment
which practically modify it, we
give the author the right of the case.
But it is palpably false, as the author
has had ample opportunity of knowing,
as respects the Catholic doctrine. He is
unscientific, moreover, in confusing the
substance of the doctrine that the generation
of the human race will cease, all
mankind be raised from the dead in
their bodies immortal, the ways of God
to man be openly vindicated before the
universe, and each one assigned to an
immutable state according to his deserts
or fitness, this visible earth also undergoing
a corresponding change of condition;
with the scenic act of proclaiming
judgment and inaugurating the new,
everlasting order, which is commonly
believed in, according to the literal
sense of the New Testament. If Mr.
Alger can show good reasons for substituting
a figurative, metaphorical interpretation
of the passages depicting
this last grand scene in the drama of
human history for the literal sense, he
is welcome to do it; but he has not
touched the substance of the Catholic
dogma which he gratuitously denies.
Mr. Alger tells us, (p. 46,) "Loyalty to
truth is the first duty of every man."
It is also one in which he himself signally
fails, by a persistent misrepresentation
of Catholic doctrines, by disregarding
the evidence which has been
clearly set before him of their truth,
subjecting his intellect to his imagination,
and preaching as "truth" opinions
which he cannot possibly prove, in the
teeth of arguments which he cannot
possibly refute. One who wilfully sins
against "the first duty of man," by rejecting
the faith and law of his Sovereign
Creator when sufficiently proposed
to him, must surely be condemned
by divine justice; and it is only such
who, the Catholic Church teaches, will
be condemned for infidelity or heresy at
the tribunal of Christ. "The judgment
of God," says the author, "is the return
of the laws of being on all deeds, actual
or ideal." (P. 66.) God, therefore, will
judge all men by acting toward them
throughout eternity in accordance with
that revealed law which is the transcript
of his own immutable nature, and which
assures us that beatitude is gained or
lost by the acts which every responsible
creature performs during the time
of probation, and that every merit or
demerit has its appropriate retribution
in another life. Perhaps the most foolish
thing in these discourses is the gleeful
assurance to the congregation of
Music Hall that the world will not
come to an end because it has gone on
so long already, although many people
expected the end before this. A great
pope has already cautioned us against
this error, in an encyclical of the first
century, beginning <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Simon Petrus, Servus
et Apostolus Jesu Christi</i>. "In
the last days there shall come scoffers
with deceit, walking according to their
own lusts, saying, Where is his promise,
or his coming? For since the
fathers slept, all things continue so
from the beginning of the creation,"
(2 Pet. iii.)</p>

<p>The good people of the Boston Music
Hall who requested the publication of
these discourses, no doubt because they
were so much delighted to think that
the world may stand for ever, have been
a little premature in their exultation.
The publication of Mr. Alger's manifesto
against St. Peter only gives another
proof that the first of the popes
was also a prophet. Who is more likely
to be infallible, Mr. Alger or St.
Peter?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Life Duties.</span> By E. E. Marcy, A.M.,
M.D. New York: D. &amp; J. Sadlier
&amp; Co. 1870.</p>

<p>This book contains many good things,
and is written in a very pleasing, literary
style. The portions of it which
treat of moral and religious duties are
likely to be useful to a certain class of
persons who seldom or never read a
book containing so much sound doctrine
and wholesome advice. The author, no
doubt, wrote with a good intention, and
endeavored to teach what he sincerely
thinks to be Catholic doctrine, and, of
course, the publishers have issued the
book in good faith, without any suspicion
that it contains any thing erroneous.
The author has, however, made a great
mistake in supposing that he is sufficiently
learned in theology to be able to
distinguish, in all cases, sound Catholic
doctrine, from his own imperfect, and
frequently incorrect, opinions, or that
he is authorized to teach the faithful in
doctrinal and spiritual matters, without
first submitting his book to revision by
a competent authority. He has, in consequence,
made some very grave mistakes
in doctrine, or at least in his manner
of expressing himself on matters of
doctrine, and also said a number of
things which are very rash and unsuitable
in a Catholic writer. On page 13
he says, "It is doubtful whether any
human being has ever passed through
a life of ordinary duration without an
occasional violation of them"&mdash;that is,
of the commandments of God. If this
refers to grievous sins, it is contrary to
the universal sentiment of Catholics,
that very many persons have passed
through even a long life without committing
any grievous sin; if it refers
to venial sin, it is false, at least as respects
the blessed Virgin Mary, who was
wholly sinless. The phraseology employed
respecting the sacraments of penance
and extreme unction is altogether
deficient, diverse from that which is
sanctioned by ecclesiastical usage, and
suggestive of errors. The sacrament of
penance is called, "repentance, acknowledgment,
reformation," without
express mention of sacramental absolution,
and extreme unction is designated
as "prayer for the sick," whereas the
holy oil is the matter of the sacrament
which was prescribed by the command
of Jesus Christ. The fathers, doctors,
and scholastic theologians, and the methods
of scholastic theology, are criticised
with an air of superior wisdom unbefitting
any Catholic writer, but especially
a tyro in theological science. After
saying that the disbelief of the real
presence is partly due to the neglect of
religious teachers "to make such clear
and just explanations as the Holy Scriptures
authorize them to make," (p. 250,)
the author undertakes to correct the
method of St. Thomas, Suarez, Bellarmine,
and the other theologians who
have hitherto been considered as our
masters and teachers, to supply for their
defects, and to explain the mystery of
transubstantiation in such a clear manner
as to remove all difficulty out of the
way of believing it. The good doctor
has unfortunately, however, proposed a
theory which subverts the Catholic doctrine
of the incarnation, and that of the
resurrection of the body. So far as we
can understand his meaning, he holds
that the spiritual or glorified body is the
same thing with the spirit or soul. In
other words, the spirit or soul is an ethereal
substance which is called spirit, inasmuch
as it is intelligent; and body, inasmuch
as it is visible and subsisting
under a certain configuration. This is
the doctrine of the spiritists, and not
that of the Catholic Church. The Catholic
doctrine is, that soul and body are
distinct, diverse substances; that the
souls of the departed are existing now
in a separate state, and that they will
receive again their bodies at the resurrection.
The author of course explains
the resurrection and present state of our
Lord in harmony with this notion; but in
contradiction to the Catholic doctrine
that our Lord raised up, glorified, and
elevated to heaven that same flesh and
blood which he took of the Virgin in the
incarnation. He moreover confuses the
human with the divine nature of Christ,
by affirming, with the Lutherans, the
ubiquity of the sacred humanity of
Christ, whom he calls the "spirit
Christ," and affirms to be everywhere
by virtue of his divine omnipresence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
This again is erroneous doctrine. The
way is prepared by these statements for
an explanation of the presence of Christ
in the eucharist, and transubstantiation.
It is not difficult to believe that God
annihilates the bread and wine, but still
causes a miraculous appearance to
make the same impression on our
senses which the bread and wine made
before the consecration. Christ, being
everywhere present, imparts the special
effects of his grace at the time of consecration
and communion. The only
trouble in the matter is, that the theory
is not true or orthodox. The body and
blood of Christ are made present under
the sacred species by the force of the consecrating
words, <em>not</em> his soul or divinity.
The soul and divinity of our blessed
Lord are present by concomitance; but
transubstantiation is the change of the
substance of the bread into the body,
and of the wine into the blood of Christ,
and here is the chief mystery of the
dogma which the author, in endeavoring
to explain, has explained away. It is
possible that the author's sense is more
orthodox than his language, and no
doubt his intention is more orthodox
than either. His language, however,
bears on the face of it the appearance
of a sense which is, in itself, contrary in
some points to definitions of faith, and
in others to the common doctrine of
theologians.</p>

<p>It is very necessary that all Catholics
should understand that they are not at
liberty to interpret either the scripture,
tradition, or the definitions of councils
in contradiction to the Catholic sense
and acceptation made known by the living
voice of the pastors and teachers
who are authorized by the church.
Those who desire to feed on the pure
milk of sound doctrine will find their
best security against error in selecting
for their theological or spiritual reading
those books which they are well assured
have the sanction and approbation of
their pastors.</p>

unusually excellent in the contents.
Nor will he be disappointed. This work
is no mere repetition of other books.
It is learned, original, carefully prepared,
well written, and has undergone an examination
by competent theologians, not
only in England, but also at Rome. The
genuine doctrine of Catholic unity, as
opposed to the pseudo-catholicity of
Anglicans, is exposed in it, with a refutation
of the objections of Bishop Forbes,
Dr. Pusey, and others. The questions
of the Easter controversy, the dispute
between St. Cyprian and Pope St. Stephen,
the dispute between Paulinus and
St. Meletius of Antioch, the Celtic controversies,
etc., are fully discussed. The
only criticism we have to make is concerning
the manner of treating the question
of the divided obediences at the
epoch between the pontificate of Urban
VI. and that of Martin V. The author
thinks that the adherents of Peter de
Luna, called Benedict XIII., were really
in schism, although most of them were
innocent of any sin. We think otherwise,
and our opinion has been derived
from the most approved Catholic authors.
Without doubt, the authors of the
division were formal schismatics. Yet
they were able to make out such a
plausible case against Urban and in
favor of Benedict, that for the time being
Urban's right was doubtful in a
large portion of Christendom. Those
who refused to recognize him were not
therefore guilty of rebellion against the
Roman pontiff as such, any more than
those would be who should refuse to
obey a papal rescript of doubtful authenticity.
After the election of Alexander
V. there was much greater reason
to doubt which of the three rival claimants,
Gregory XII., Benedict XIII.,
or Alexander V., was the true pope. It
is now perfectly certain that Gregory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
XII. was canonically elected, and we
suppose it is by far the more probable
opinion that he remained in possession
of his right as legitimate pope until his
voluntary resignation at the Council of
Constance. Nevertheless, his claim, at
the time, was a doubtful one, and the
majority of the cardinals and bishops
adhered, after the Council of Pisa, to
Alexander V. and his successor John
XXIII. Peter de Luna was a schismatic
in the fullest extent of the word.
But what shall we say of Alexander and
John? Their names still appear on the
lists of popes, and some maintain that
they were true popes. They undoubtedly
believed that a council could depose
doubtful popes, and that therefore the
Council of Pisa could deprive both Gregory
and Benedict of whatever claim
either of them might have to the papal
throne. They believed themselves lawfully
elected, and were not, therefore,
schismatics, even though they were not
lawful popes. If the author maintains
that two of the three obediences
which eventually concurred at Constance
in the election of Martin V. were in a
state of schism until that time, we cannot
agree with him, and we think we
have the best authorities on our side.
For, if these obediences were in schism,
they were no part of the true church,
the jurisdiction of their bishops and
priests was forfeited, and the Catholic
Church was limited to the obedience
of the legitimate pontiff. This theory
would involve the author in considerable
difficulties, and we wonder that it
was allowed to escape the notice of his
Roman examiners. The case is very
plain, to our thinking. Neither of these
three parties rebelled against the Roman
see, or refused to obey the laws of any
pontiff whose legitimacy was unquestionable.
It was a dispute about the
succession, not a revolt against the
principle of authority. There was,
therefore, no schism in the case; all
were equally members of the Catholic
Church, and jurisdiction remained in the
bishops of all the contending parties.
Those who wilfully promoted this dissension
were grievously culpable, but the
rest were free from sin, as long as they
acted in good faith. The author devotes
only a short space to this question,
and with this exception his work
is most admirable, and worthy of a
most extensive circulation.</p>

the Hon. Colin Lindsay. London:
Longmans &amp; Co. For sale by the
Catholic Publication Society, New
York.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay was president of the
Anglican Union when, after long study,
he submitted to the authority of the
holy Roman Church. His conversion
made a great sensation, and called out
the usual amount of foolish, ill-natured
twaddle. In this volume he has given
a masterly, lawyer-like, and extensive
summary, richly furnished with evidences
and authorities, of the scriptural
and historical argument for the supremacy
of St. Peter and his successors.
We welcome and recommend this admirable
work most cordially. The author
is a convert of the old stamp of Newman,
Wilberforce, Oakeley, Faber, and
Manning; that is, a convert to genuine
and thorough-going Catholicity; and
not one of those who has been spoiled
by the fatal influence of Munich. The
spurious coin which dealers in counterfeit
Catholicism are seeking just now to
palm off on the unwary is distinguished
from the genuine by its faint delineation
of the pope's effigy on its surface. A
primacy in the universal church similar
to that of a metropolitan in a province
is all they will admit the pope to possess
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure divino</i>. The true Catholicity
brings out the divine supremacy of the
successor of St. Peter into bold relief.
This is just now the great question, the
criterion of orthodox belief, the touchstone
of faith, the one great fact and
doctrine to be insisted on against every
form of anti-Catholic error, from that
of the Greeks to that of the atheists.
The pope is the visible representative of
Christ on the earth, of God's law, of revealed
religion, of the supernatural, and
of moral and political order. The one
question of his supremacy in the true
and full sense of the word being settled,
every thing else follows as a necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
consequence, and is established. It is
very important, therefore, that books
should be multiplied on this topic, and
that the utmost pains should be taken
by the clergy to indoctrinate the people
and instruct fully converts concerning
that loyal allegiance and unreserved obedience
which all Catholics owe to the
vicar of Christ. This book will be
found to be one of the best. We have
received also from London a very clever
critique on "Janus," by F. Keogh, of
the Oratory, and are glad to see that the
learned Dr. HergenrÃ¶ther, of WÃ¼rzburg,
is preparing an elaborate refutation of
that mischievous production. The second
part of F. Bottalla's work on the

Royal College of St. Patrick, Maynooth.
London: Longmans, Green,
Reader &amp; Dyer. 1870. For sale by

<p>The author discusses in this volume
two interpretations of the Mosaic account
of creation: 1st, that a long interval
may have elapsed between the
creation and the work of the six days;
2d, that the six days themselves may be
long periods of time; and shows that
they are both admissible, and that the
last corresponds pretty well with the
present state of geological science. In
a subsequent work, he proposes to discuss
the question of the antiquity of
man.</p>

<p>Though he does not claim to have
written a manual of geology, the first
and larger part of the work is in fact an
excellent compendium of the science,
and is written in a remarkably interesting
and readable style. A few such
books would do much to remove the
dislike and distrust of geology which
still prevails to some extent among religious
people, and perhaps also to convince
scientific unbelievers.</p>

<p>This volume contains the reports of
the parties sent from the Naval Observatory

as those of Mr. W. S. Gilman, Jr., and
General Albert J. Myer, at St. Paul Junction,
Iowa, and Abingdon, Va., respectively,
who also communicated their observations
to the superintendent. The
latter saw the eclipse from the top of
White Top Mountain, 5530 feet high;
the effect was, of course, magnificent.
The papers of Professor Harkness on
the spectrum, and of Dr. Curtis on the
photographs which they obtained at Des
Moines, are specially interesting. One
hundred and twenty-two photographs
were taken in all, two during the totality,
fac-similes of which last are appended,
together with other representations of
the total phase, and copies of the spectra
observed, etc. Professor Harkness
observed what appears to be a very decided
iron line in the spectrum of the
corona, which was otherwise continuous,
and he considers it quite probable that
this mysterious halo is to a great extent
or even perhaps principally composed of
the vapor of this metal. He saw magnesium
and hydrogen in the prominences,
and the unknown substance which
has been elsewhere observed.</p>

<p>Professor Hall, who went to Siberia,
was unfortunate, the weather being
cloudy during the eclipse, though clear
before and afterward; but he made what
observations were practicable under the
circumstances.</p>

Hall, M.D. New York: Hurd &amp;
Houghton. 1870. Pp. 277.</p>

<p>This work is intended to show that
good health can be maintained, and
many diseases prevented, by proper
care in eating. The doctor does not
use the phrase "good living" in its ordinary
meaning; he defines it to be a
good appetite followed by good digestion.
His rules for obtaining this two-fold
blessing are generally sensible; but
a few of his statements are somewhat
exaggerated. We have no doubt that
the health of the community would be
improved by following the common-sense
directions of Dr. Hall; but unfortunately,
as the doctor himself remarks,
not one person in a thousand of
his readers will have sufficient control
over his appetite to carry out these suggestions,
which require so much self-denial.
We are glad to see the doctor recommends
a strict observance of Lent.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful story of the early

lived in Rome, and the Roman matrons

gave to the world such beautiful examples
of virtue, and to the church so many
saints. It is a book that should be read
now; for though we do not live in a pagan
age, we surely are not living in an
age of faith; and the example of a Jerome,
a Melania, and a Valeria are as
necessary as when the light of Christianity

<h2>CHURCH AND STATE.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></h2>


<p>Il Signor CantÃ¹ is one of the
ablest men and most distinguished contemporary
authors of Italy. He is a
layman, and has usually been reckoned
among the better class of so-called
liberal Catholics, and certainly is a
warm friend of liberty, civil and religious,
a sincere and earnest Italian patriot,
thoroughly devoted to the holy
see, and a firm and fearless defender
of the rights, freedom, independence,
and authority of the spiritual order
in its relation to the temporal.</p>

<p>We know not where to look for a
truer, fuller, more loyal, or more judicious
treatment in so brief a compass
of the great and absorbing question
in regard to the relation of church
and state, than in his article from the
<cite>Rivista Universale</cite>, the title of which
we give at the foot of the page. He
is an erudite rather than a philosopher,
a historian rather than a theologian;
yet his article is equally remarkable
for its learning, its history,
its philosophy, its theology, and its
canon law, and, with slight reservation,
as to his interpretation of the
bull <cite>Unam Sanctam</cite> of Boniface VIII.
and some views hinted rather than
expressed as to the origin and nature
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magisterium</i> exercised by the
popes over sovereigns in the middle
ages, we believe it as true and as exact
as it is learned and profound, full
and conclusive, and we recommend its
careful study to all who would master
the question it treats.</p>

<p>For ourselves, we have treated the
question of church and state so often,
so fully, and so recently, in its principle
and in its several aspects, especially in
relation to our own government, that
we know not that we have any thing
to add to what we have already said,
and we might dispense ourselves from
its further discussion by simply referring
to the articles, <cite>Independence of the
Church</cite>, October, 1866; <cite>Church and
State</cite>, April, 1867; <cite>Rome and the
World</cite>, October of the same year; and
to our more recent articles on <cite>The
Future of Protestantism and Catholicity</cite>,
especially the third and fourth,
January, February, March, and April,
of the present year; and also to the
article on <cite>The School Question</cite>, in
the very last number before the present.
We can do, and we shall attempt,
in the present article, to do,
little more than bring together and
present as a whole what is scattered
through these several articles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
offer respectfully and even timidly
such suggestions as we think will
not be presumptuous in regard to the
means, in the present emergency, of
realizing more perfectly at home and
abroad the ideal of Christian society.</p>

<p>We assume in the outset that there
really exist in human society two distinct
orders, the spiritual and the temporal,
each with its own distinctive
functions, laws, and sphere of action.
In Christian society, the representative
of the spiritual order is the church,
and the representative of the temporal
is the state. In the rudest stages
of society the elements of the two
orders exist, but are not clearly apprehended
as distinct orders, nor as having
each its distinct and proper representative.
It is only in Christian
society, or society enlightened by
the Gospel, that the two orders are
duly distinguished, and each in its
own representative is placed in its
normal relation with the other.</p>

<p>The type, indeed the reason, of this
distinction of two orders in society is
in the double nature of man, or the
fact that man exists only as soul and
body, and needs to be cared for in
each. The church, representing the
spiritual, has charge of the souls of
men, and looks after their minds,
ideas, intelligence, motives, consciences,
and consequently has the supervision
of education, morals, literature,
science, and art. The state, representing
the temporal, has charge of
men's bodies, and looks after the material
wants and interests of individuals
and society. We take this illustration
from the fathers and mediÃ¦val
doctors. It is perfect. The analogy
of church and state in the moral
order, with the soul and body in the
physical order, commends itself to the
common sense of every one, and carries
in itself the evidence of its justness,
especially when it is seen to
correspond strictly in the moral order,
to the distinction of soul and body in
the physical order. We shall take,
then, the relation of soul and body as
the type throughout of the ideal relation
of church and state.</p>

<p>Man lives not as body alone, nor
as soul alone, but as the union of
the two, in reciprocal commerce. Soul
and body are distinct, but not separate.
Each has its own distinctive
properties and functions, and neither
can replace the other; but their separation
is death, the death of the body
only, not of the soul indeed, for
that is immortal. The body is material,
and, separated from the soul,
is dust and ashes, mere slime of the
earth, from which it was formed. It
is the same in the moral order with
society, which is not state alone, nor
church alone, but the union of the
two in reciprocal commerce. The
two are distinct, each has its distinctive
nature, laws, and functions, and
neither can perform the functions of
the other, or take the other's place.
But though distinct, they cannot in
the normal state of society be separated.
The separation of the state
from the church is in the moral order
what the separation of the body from
the soul is in the physical order. It
is death, the death of the state, not
indeed of the church; for she, like
the soul, nay, like God himself, is immortal.
The separation of the state
from the church destroys its moral
life, and leaves society to become a
mass of moral rottenness and corruption.
Hence, the holy father includes
the proposition to separate church
and state, in his syllabus of condemned
propositions.</p>

<p>The soul is defined by the church
as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forma corporis</i>, the informing
or vital principle of the body. The
church in the moral order is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forma
civitatis</i>, the informing, the vital principle
of the state or civil society,
which has no moral life of its own,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
since all moral life, by its very term,
proceeds from the spiritual order.
There is in the physical order no existence,
but from God through the
medium of his creative act; so is
there no moral life in society, but
from the spiritual order which is
founded by God as supreme law-giver,
and represented by the church, the
guardian and judge alike of the natural
law and the revealed law.</p>

<p>The soul is the nobler and superior
part of man, and it belongs to it,
not to make away with the body, or
to assume its functions, but to exercise
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magisterium</i> over it, to direct
and govern it according to the law of
God; not to the body to assume the
mastery over the soul, and to bring
the law of the mind into captivity
to law in the members. So is the
church, as representing the spiritual
order, and charged with the care of
souls, the nobler and superior part of
society, and to her belongs the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magisterium</i>
of entire human society;
and it is for her in the moral order to
direct and control civil society, by
judicially declaring, and applying to
its action, the law of God, of which
she is, as we have just said, the guardian
and judge, and to which it is
bound by the Supreme Law-Giver to
subordinate its entire official conduct.</p>

<p>We note here that this view condemns
alike the absorption of the
state in the church, and the absorption
of the church in the state, and
requires each to remain distinct from
the other, each with its own organization,
organs, faculties, and sphere
of action. It favors, therefore, neither
what is called theocracy, or <i>clerocracy</i>,
rather, to which Calvinistic Protestantism
is strongly inclined, nor the
supremacy of the state, to which the
age tends, and which was assumed
in all the states of Gentile antiquity,
whence came the persecution of Christians
by the pagan emperors. We
note farther, that the church does
not make the law; she only promulgates,
declares, and applies it, and is
herself as much bound by it as is the
state itself. The law itself is prescribed
for the government of all
men and nations, by God himself as
supreme law-giver, or the end or final
cause of creation, and binds equally
states and individuals, churchmen and
statesmen, sovereigns and subjects.</p>

<p>Such, as we have learned it, is the
Catholic doctrine of the relation of
church and state, and such is the relation
that in the divine order really
exists between the two orders, and
which the church has always and
everywhere labored with all her zeal
and energy to introduce and maintain
in society. It is her ideal of catholic
or truly Christian society, but which
has never yet been perfectly realized,
though an approach to its realization,
the author thinks, was made under
the Christian Roman emperors. The
chronic condition of the two orders
in society, instead of union and coÃ¶peration,
or reciprocal commerce,
has been that of mutual distrust or
undisguised hostility. During the
first three centuries, the relation between
them was that of open antagonism,
and the blood of Christians
made the greater part of the
world then known hallowed ground,
and the Christians, as Lactantius remarks,
conquered the world, not by
slaughtering, but by being slaughtered.
The pagan sovereign of Rome
claimed, and was held to unite both
powers in himself, and was at once
<i>imperator</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontifix maximus</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">divus</i>,
or god. The state, even after
the conversion of the empire and of
the barbarians that overturned it and
seated themselves on its ruins, never
fully disclaimed the spiritual faculties
conceded it by GrÃ¦co-Roman or Italo-Greek
civilization.</p>

<p>All through the middle ages, Kenelm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Digby's ages of faith, when it is
pretended the church had every thing
her own way, and the haughty power
of her supreme pontiffs and their tyranny
over such meek and lamb-like
temporal princes as Henry IV., Frederick
Barbarossa, and Frederick II. of
Germany, Philip Augustus of France,
Henry II. and John Lackland of England,
have been the theme of many a
school-boy declamation against her,
and adduced by grave statesmen as
an excuse for depriving Catholics of
their liberty, confiscating their goods,
and cutting their throats&mdash;all through
those ages, we say, she enjoyed not a
moment's peace, hardly a truce, and
was obliged to sustain an unceasing
struggle with the civil authority against
its encroachments on the spiritual order,
and for her own independence
and freedom of action as the church
of God. In this struggle, the struggle
of mind against matter, of moral
power against physical force, the
church was far from being, at least to
human eyes, always victorious, and
she experienced more than one disastrous
defeat. In the sixteenth century,
CÃ¦sar carried away from her the
north of Europe, as he had long
since carried away the whole east, and
forced her, in the nations that professed
to recognize her as representing
the spiritual order, to make him such
large concessions as left her little more
than the shadow of independence;
and the people and their rulers are
now almost everywhere conspiring
to take away even that shadow, and
to render her completely subject to
the state, or representative of the temporal
order.</p>

<p>There is no opinion more firmly
fixed in the minds of the people of
to-day, at least according to the journals,
than that the union of church
and state is execrable and ought not
to be suffered to exist. The words
cannot be pronounced without sending
a thrill of horror through society,
and calling forth the most vigorous
and indignant protest from every self-appointed
defender of modern civilization,
progress, liberty, equality, and
fraternity. What is called the "Liberal
party," sometimes "the movement
party," but what we call "the revolution,"
has everywhere for its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primum
mobile</i>, its impulse and its motive, the
dissolution of what remains of the
union of church and state, the total
separation of the state from the church
and its assertion as the supreme and
only legitimate authority in society,
to which all orders and classes of
men, and all matters, whether temporal
or spiritual, must be subjected.
The great words of the party, as pronounced
by its apostles and chiefs, are
"people-king," "people-priest," "people-God."
There is no denying the
fact. Science, or what passes for
science, denies the double nature
of man, the distinction between soul
and body, and makes the soul the
product of material organization, or a
mere function of the body; and the
more popular philosophy suppresses
the spiritual order in society, and
therefore rejects its pretended representative;
and the progress of intelligence
suppresses God, and leaves for
society only political atheism pure
and simple, as is evident from the
savage war-whoop set up throughout
the civilized world against the syllabus
of condemned propositions published
by our holy father, December,
1864. This syllabus touched the
deep wound of modern society, probed
it to the quick, and hence the
writhings and contortions, the groans
and screechings it occasioned. May
God grant that it touched to heal, exposed
the wound only to apply the
remedy.</p>

<p>But the remedy&mdash;what is it, where
shall we seek it, and how shall it
be applied? The question is delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
as well as grave, let it be answered
as it may. The principles of the
church are inflexible and unalterable,
and must be preserved inviolate; and
even the susceptibilities of both statesmen
and churchmen, in regard to
changes in old customs and usages,
even when not unchangeable in their
nature, are to be gently treated. The
church is not less bound by the law of
God than is the state; for she does not,
as we have said, make the law, she only
administers it. Undoubtedly, she has
in a secondary sense legislative authority
or power to enact canons or rules
and regulations for preserving, carrying
out, and applying the law, as the
court adopts its own rules and regulations,
or as does the executive authority,
even in a government like ours, for
executing the law enacted by the legislative
power. These may no doubt
be changed from time to time by the
church as she judges necessary, proper,
or expedient in order the better
to meet the changing circumstances
in relation to which she is obliged to
act. But even in these respects,
changes must be made in strict conformity
to law; and although they
may be so made and leave the law
intact, and affect only the modes or
forms of its administration, they are
not without a certain danger. The
faithful may mistake them for changes
or innovations in the law itself, and
enemies may represent them as such,
and sophistically adduce them against
the church as disproving her immutability
and infallibility.</p>

<p>There have been, and no doubt are
still, abuses in the church growing out
of its human side, which need changes
in discipline to reform them; but
these abuses have always been exaggerated
by the best and holiest men
in the church, and the necessity of a
change in discipline or ecclesiastical
law, as distinguished from the law of
God, is seldom, if ever, created by
them. When evils exist that menace
both faith and society, it is not the
church that is in fault, but the world
that refuses to conform to the law as
she declares and applies it. It was
not abuses in the church that were
the chief cause of the revolt, the heresy,
and schism of the reformers in the
sixteenth century; for they were far
less then than they had been one,
two, three, or even four centuries previous.
The worst abuses and greatest
scandals which had previously
obtained had already been corrected,
and Leo X. had assembled the Fifth
Council of the Lateran for the purpose
of restoring discipline and rendering
it still more effective. The evil originated
in the temporal order as represented
by the state, and grew out of
secular changes and abuses. It was
so then, it is so now, always was and
always will be so. Why, then, demand
changes or reform in the church,
which cannot reach them? The
church causes none of the evils at any
time complained of, and offers no obstacle
to their removal, or the redress
of social grievances. It is for the
temporal to yield to the spiritual, not
for the spiritual to yield to the temporal.
Very true; and yet the church
may condescend to the world in its
weakness for the sake of elevating it
to harmony with her own ideal. God,
when he would take away sin, and
save the souls he had created and
which he loved, did not stand aloof,
or, so to speak, on his dignity, and bid
the sinner cease sinning and obey
him, without stretching forth his hand
to help him; but made himself man,
humbled himself, took the form of a
servant, and came to the world lying
in wickedness and festering in iniquity,
took it by the hand, and sweetly
and gently led the sinner away from
sin to virtue and holiness.</p>

<p>For four hundred years, the church
has sought to maintain peace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
concord between herself and the state
by concordats, as the wisest and best
expedient she found practicable. But
concordats, however useful or necessary,
do not realize the ideal of Christian
society. They do not effect the
true union of church and state, and
cannot be needed where that union
exists. They imply not the union,
but the separation of church and
state, and are neither necessary nor
admissible, except where the state
claims to be separate from and independent
of the church. They are a
compromise in which the church concedes
the exercise of certain rights to
the state in consideration of its pledge
to secure her in the free and peaceable
exercise of the rest, and to render
her the material force in the execution
of her spiritual canons, which she may
need but does not herself possess.
They are defensible only as necessary
expedients, to save the church and
the state from falling into the relation
of direct and open antagonism.</p>

<p>Yet even as expedients concordats
have been at best only partially successful,
and now seem on the point
of failing altogether. While the church
faithfully observes their stipulations so
far as they bind her, the state seldom
observes them in the respect that they
bind it, and violates them as often as
they interfere with its own ambitious
projects or policy. The church has
concordats with the greater part of
the European states, and yet while in
certain respects they trammel her freedom,
they afford her little or no protection.
The state everywhere claims
the right to violate or abrogate them
at will, without consulting her, the
other party to the contract. It has
done so in Spain, in Italy, and in
Austria; and if France at present observes
the concordat of 1801, she does
it only in the sense of the "organic
articles," never inserted in it, but added
by the First Consul on his authority
alone, and always protested against
by the supreme pontiff and vicar of
Christ; and there is no foreseeing what
the present or a new ministry may do.
Even if the governments were disposed
to observe them, their people
would not suffer them to do so, as we
see in Spain and Austria. Times have
changed, and the governments no longer
govern the people, but the people,
or the demagogues who lead them,
now govern the governments. The
European governments sustain their
power, even their existence, only by
the physical force of five millions of
armed soldiers.</p>

<p>There is evidently, then, little reliance
to be placed on the governments; for
they are liable, any day, to be changed
or overthrown. The strongest of
them hope to sustain themselves and
keep the revolution in check only by
concessions, as we see in the extension
of suffrage in England, and the
adoption of parliamentary government,
under a constitutional monarch,
in Austria, France, North Germany,
and elsewhere. But as yet the concessions
of the governments have nowhere
strengthened them or weakened
the revolution. One concession
becomes the precedent for another,
and one demand satisfied only leads
to another and a greater demand,
while it diminishes the power of the
government to resist. What is more,
the closer the union of the church
with the government the more helpless
it becomes, and the greater the
hostility it incurs. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primum mobile</i>
of the movement party, as we
now find it, is not the love of honest
liberty, or a liberty compatible with
stable government, or the establishment
of a democratic or republican
constitution; and it is not hostile to the
church only because she exerts her
power to sustain the governments it
would reform or revolutionize, but rather,
because it regards them as upholding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the church, which they detest and
would annihilate. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primum mobile</i>
is hatred of the church. This is
the reason why, even when the governments
are well disposed, as sometimes
they are, the people will not
suffer them to observe faithfully their
engagements to the church.</p>

<p>Here was the mistake of the brilliant
but unhappy De la Mennais.
He called upon the church to cut
herself loose from her entangling alliance
with the state, and throw herself
back on the people; which would
have been not bad counsel, if the people
were hostile to her only because
they supposed her allied with despotic
governments, or if they were less
hostile to her than the governments
themselves. But such is not the fact
at present. The people are to-day
controlled by Catholics who care little
for any world but the present, by
Protestants, rationalists, Jews, infidels,
and humanitarians; and to act on the
Lamennaisian counsel would seem
very much like abandoning weak, timid,
and too exacting friends, to throw
one's self into the arms of powerful and
implacable enemies. When, in the
beginning of his reign, the holy father
adopted some popular measures, he
was universally applauded, but he did
not win those who applauded him to
the church; and his measures were applauded
by the outside world only
because believed to be such as would
tend to undermine his own authority,
and pave the way for the downfall of
Catholicity. The movement party
applauded, because they thought they
could use him as an instrument for
the destruction of the church. In
the French Revolution of February,
1848, originating in deep-seated and
inveterate hostility to the church, the
ready acceptance of the republic, the
next day after its proclamation, by the
French bishops and clergy, did not
for a moment conciliate the hostility
in which the revolution had its origin.
They were applauded indeed, but only
in the hope of making use of them
to democratize, or secularize, and
therefore to destroy the church as
the authoritative representative of the
spiritual order. The bishops and
priests, all but a very small minority,
showed that they understood and appreciated
the applause they received,
by abandoning the revolution at the
earliest practicable moment, and lending
their support to the movement
for the Establishment of imperialism;
for they felt that they could more
safely rely on the emperor than on
the republic.</p>

<p>These facts and the reminiscences of
the old French Revolution, have created
in the great majority of intelligent
and earnest Catholics, wisely or
unwisely, we say not, a profound distrust
of the movement party, which
professes to be the party of liberty,
and which carries in its train, if not
the numerical majority, at least the active,
energetic, and leading minds of
their respective nations, those that form
public opinion and give its direction,
and make them honestly believe that
Catholic interests, which are not separable
from the interests of society,
will be best protected and promoted
by the church's standing by the governments
and aiding them in their
repressive measures. Perhaps they are
right. The church, of course, cannot
abandon society; but in times like
ours, it is not easy to say on which
side lie the interests of society. Is it
certain that they lie on either side,
either with the governments as they
are, or with the party opposed to
them? At present the church neither
directs the governments nor controls
the popular or so-called liberal
movement; and we confess it is difficult
to say from which she and society
have most to dread. Governments
without her direction want morality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and can govern only by force; and
popular movements not inspired or
controlled by her are blind and lawless,
and tend only to anarchy, and
the destruction of liberty as well as
of order, of morality as well as of
religion as a directing and governing
power. We distrust both.</p>

<p>For ourselves personally, we are
partial to our own American system,
which, unless we are blinded by our
national prejudices, comes nearer
to the realization of the true union
as well as distinction of church and
state than has heretofore or elsewhere
been effected; and we own we should
like to see it, if practicable there, introduced&mdash;by
lawful means only&mdash;into
the nations of Europe. The American
system may not be practicable in
Europe; but, if so, we think it would
be an improvement. Foreigners do
not generally, nor even do all Americans
themselves fully understand the
relation of church and state, as it
really subsists in the fundamental constitution
of American society. Abroad
and at home there is a strong disposition
to interpret it by the theory of
European liberalism, and both they
who defend and they who oppose the
union of church and state, regard it
as based on their total separation. But
the reverse of this, as we understand
it, is the fact. American society is
based on the principle of their union;
and union, while it implies distinction,
denies separation. Modern infidelity
or secularism is, no doubt, at
work here as elsewhere to effect their
separation; but as yet the two orders
are distinct, each with its distinct organization,
sphere of action, representative,
and functions, but not separate.
Here the rights of neither are
held to be grants from the other. The
rights of the church are not franchises
or concessions from the state, but
are recognized by the state as held
under a higher law than its own, and
therefore rights prior to and above
itself, which it is bound by the law
constituting it to respect, obey, and,
whenever necessary, to use its physical
force to protect and vindicate.</p>

<p>The original settlers of the Anglo-American
colonies were not infidels,
but, for the most part, sincerely religious
and Christian in their way, and
in organizing society aimed not simply
to escape the oppression of conscience,
of which they had been the
victims in the mother country, but
to found a truly Christian commonwealth;
and such commonwealth they
actually founded, as perfect as was
possible with their imperfect and often
erroneous views of Christianity.
The colonies of New England inclined,
no doubt, to a theocracy, and
tended to absorb the state in the
church; in the Southern colonies, the
tendency was, as in England, to establish
the supremacy of the civil order,
and to make the church a function
of the state. These two opposite
tendencies meeting in the formation
of American society, to a great extent,
counterbalanced each other, and
resulted in the assertion of the supremacy
of the Christian idea, or the
union and distinction under the law
of God, of the two orders. In principle,
at least, each order exists in
American society in its normal relation
to the other; and also in its integrity,
with its own distinctive nature,
laws, and functions, and therefore
the temporal in its proper subordination
to the spiritual.</p>

<p>This subordination is, indeed, not
always observed in practice, nor always
even theoretically admitted.
Many Americans, at first thought,
when it is broadly stated, will indignantly
deny it. We shall find even
Catholics who do not accept it, and
gravely tell us that their religion has
nothing to do with their politics; that
is, their politics are independent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
their religion; that is, again, politics
are independent of God, and there is
no God in the political order; as if a
man could be an atheist in the state,
and a devout Catholic in the church.
But too many Catholics, at home and
abroad, act as if this were indeed
possible, and very reasonable, nay,
their duty; and hence the political
world is given over to the violence
and corruption in which Satan finds
a rich harvest. But let the state pass
some act that openly and undisguisedly
attacks the rights, the freedom,
or independence of the church, in a
practical way, it will be hard to find
a single Catholic, in this country at
least, who would not denounce it as
an outrage on his conscience, which
shows that the assertion of the separation
of politics from religion so
thoughtlessly made, really means only
the distinction, not the separation of
the two orders, or that politics are independent,
so long as they do not run
counter to the freedom and independence
of religion, or fail to respect
and protect the rights of the church.
Inexactness of expression, and bad
logic do not necessarily indicate unsound
faith.</p>

<p>Most non-Catholics will deny that
the American state is founded on the
recognition of the independence and
superiority of the spiritual order, and
therefore, of the church, and the confession
of its own subordination to
the spiritual, not only in the order of
logic, as Il Signor CantÃ¹ maintains,
but also in the order of authority;
yet a little reflection ought to satisfy
every one that such is the fact, and
if it does not, it will be owing to a
misconception of what is spiritual.
The basis of the American state or
constitution, the real, unwritten, providential
constitution, we mean, is
what are called the natural and inalienable
rights of man; and we know
no American citizen who does not
hold that these rights are prior to
civil society, above it, and held independently
of it; or that does not maintain
that the great end for which civil
society is instituted is to protect, defend,
and vindicate, if need be, with
its whole physical force, these sacred
and inviolable rights for each and
every citizen, however high, however
low. This is our American boast,
our American conception of political
justice, glory. These rights, among
which are life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness, are the higher, the
supreme law for civil society, which
the state, however constituted, is
bound to recognize and obey. They
deny the absolutism of the state, define
its sphere, restrict its power, and
prescribe its duty.</p>

<p>But whence come these rights?
and how can they bind the state, and
prescribe its duty? We hold these
rights by virtue, of our manhood, it is
said; they are inherent in it, and constitute
it. But my rights bind you,
and yours bind me, and yet you and
I are equal; our manhoods are equal.
How, then, can the manhood of either
bind or morally oblige the other?
Of things equal one cannot be superior
to another. They are in our nature
as men, it is said again, or, simply,
we hold them from nature. They are
said to be natural rights and inalienable,
and what is natural must be in or
from nature. Nature is taken in two
senses; as the physical order or the
physical laws constitutive of the physical
universe, and as the moral law
under which all creatures endowed
with reason and free-will are placed
by the Creator, and which is cognizable
by natural reason or the reason
common to all men. In the first
sense, these rights are not inherent in
our nature as men, nor from nature, or
in nature; for they are not physical.
Physical rights are a contradiction in
terms. They can be inherent in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
nature only in the second sense, and
in our moral nature only, and consequently
are held under the law which
founds and sustains moral nature, or
the moral order as distinct from the
physical order.</p>

<p>But the moral law, the so-called
law of nature, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droit naturel</i>, which
founds and sustains the moral order,
the order of right, of justice, is not a
law founded or prescribed by nature,
but the law for the moral government
of nature, under which all moral natures
are placed by the Author of nature
as supreme law-giver. The law
of nature is God's law; and whatever
rights it founds or are held from it are
his rights, and ours only because they
are his. My rights, in relation to you,
are your duties, what God prescribes
as the law of your conduct to me;
and your rights are, in relation to me,
my duties to you, what God prescribes
as the rule of my conduct to you.
But what God prescribes he has the
right to prescribe, and therefore can
command me to respect no rights in
you, and you to respect no rights in
me, that are not his; and being his,
civil society is bound by them, and
cannot alienate them or deny them
without violating his law, and robbing
him of his rights. Hence, he who does
an injury to another wrongs not him
only, but wrongs his Maker, his Sovereign,
and his Judge.</p>

<p>Take any of the rights enumerated
as inalienable in the preamble to
the Declaration of Independence.
Among these is the right to life.
This right all men and civil society
itself are bound to treat as sacred
and inviolable. But all men are created
equal, and under the law of nature
have equal rights. But how
can equals bind one another? By
mutual compact. But whence the
obligation of the compact? Why am
I obliged to keep my word? Certainly
not by the word itself; but because
I should deprive him of his right to
whom I have pledged it. But I have
given my word to assist in committing
a murder. Am I bound to keep it?
Not at all. Why not? Because I
have pledged myself to commit a
crime, to do a wrong or unjust act.
Evidently, then, compacts or pledged
words do not create justice, they presuppose
it; and it is only in virtue of
the law of justice that compacts are
obligatory, and no compacts not
conformable to that law can bind.
Why, then, am I bound to respect
your life? It is not you who can
bind me; for you and I are equals,
and neither in his own name can bind
the other. To take your life would
be an unjust act; that is, I should rob
justice of its right to your life. The
right to life is then the right of justice.
But justice is not an abstraction; it is
not a mental conception, but a reality,
and therefore God; and hence the
right for you or me to live is the right
of him who hath made us and whose
we are, with all that we are, all that we
have, and all that we can do. Hence,
the right to life is inalienable even
by myself, and suicide is not only a
crime against society, but a sin against
God; for God owns it as his right,
and therefore he has the right to command
all men to hold it in every
man sacred and inviolable, and never
to be taken by other men or even civil
society, but at his order. So of all
the other rights of man.</p>

<p>If the rights of man are the rights
of God in and over man as his creature,
as they undeniably are, they lie
in the spiritual order, are spiritual, not
temporal. The American state, then,
in recognizing the independence, superiority,
and inviolability of the rights
of man, does recognize, in principle,
the independence, superiority, and inviolability
of the spiritual order, and
its own subordination to it, and obligation
to consult it and conform to it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
It then recognizes the church divinely
appointed and commissioned by
God with plenary authority to represent
it, and apply the law of God to
the government of the people as the
state no less than to the people as individuals.
This follows as a necessary
consequence. If God has made a
supernatural revelation, we are bound
by the natural law to believe it; and
if he has instituted a church to represent
the spiritual, or concreted the
spiritual in a visible organism, with
plenary authority to teach his word
to all men and nations, and to declare
and apply his law in the government
of human affairs, we are bound to
accept and obey her the moment the
fact is brought sufficiently to our
knowledge. This shows that the
true church, if such church there
be, is sacred and inviolable, and that
what she declares to be the law of
God is his law, which binds every
conscience; and all sovereigns and
subjects, states and citizens are alike
bound to obey her. He who refuses
to obey her refuses to obey God; he
who spurns her spurns God; he who
despises her despises God; and he
who despoils her of any of her rights
or possessions despoils God. Kings
and the great of the earth, statesmen
and courtiers, demagogues and politicians
are apt to forget this, and because
God does not instantly punish
their sacrilege with a visible and material
punishment, conclude that they
may outrage her to their heart's content
with impunity. But the punishment
is sure to follow in due course,
and so far as it concerns states, dynasties,
and society, in the shape of
moral weakness, imbecility, corruption,
and death.</p>

<p>That the American state is true to
the order it acknowledges, and never
usurps any spiritual functions, we do
not pretend. The American state
copies in but too many instances the
bad legislation of Europe. It from
the outset showed the original vice of
the American people; for while they
very justly subjected the state to the
law of God, they could subject it to
that law only as they understood it,
and their understanding of it was in
many respects faulty, which was no
wonder, since they had no infallible,
no authoritative, in fact, no representative
at all of the spiritual order, and
knew the law of God only so far as
taught it by natural reason, and spelled
out by their imperfect light from
an imperfect and mutilated text of the
written word. They had a good major
proposition, namely, the spiritual
order duly represented is supreme,
and should govern all men collectively
and individually, as states and as citizens;
but their minor was bad. But
we with our reading of the Bible do
duly represent that order. Therefore,
etc. Now, we willingly admit that a
people reverencing and reading the
Bible as the word of God, will in
most respects have a far truer and
more adequate knowledge of the law
of God than those who have neither
church nor Bible, and only their reason
and the mutilated, perverted, and
even travestied traditions of the primitive
revelation retained and transmitted
by Gentilism, and therefore
that Protestantism as understood by
the American colonists is much better
for society than the liberalism asserted
by the movement party either here
or in Europe; but its knowledge will
still be defective, and leave many painful
gaps on many important points;
and the state, having no better knowledge,
will almost inevitably misconceive
what on various matters the law
of God actually prescribes or forbids.</p>

<p>The American state, misled by public
opinion, usurps the functions of
the church in some very grave matters.
It assumes the control of marriage
and education, therefore of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
family relations, of the family itself,
and of ideas, intelligence, opinions,
which we have seen are functions of
the church, and both are included in
the two sacraments of marriage and
orders. It also fails to recognize the
freedom and independence of the
spiritual order in refusing to recognize
the church as a corporation, a moral
person, as capable of possessing property
as any natural or private person,
and therefore denies to the spiritual
order the inalienable right of
property. The American state denies
to the church all possessory rights unless
incorporated by itself. This is
all wrong; but if no better, it is no
worse than what is assumed by the
state in every European nation; and
the most that can be said is, that in
these matters the state forgets the
Christian commonwealth for the pagan,
as is done everywhere else.</p>

<p>But except in these instances, the
American state is, we believe, true to
the Christian principle on which it is
based, as true, that is, as it can be in
a mixed community of Catholics,
Jews, and Protestants. The state
has no spiritual competency, and cannot
decide either for itself or for its
citizens which is or is not the church
that authoritatively represents the spiritual
order. The responsibility of
that decision it does and must leave
to its citizens, who must decide for
themselves, and answer to God for
the rectitude of their decision. Their
decision is law for the state, and it
must respect and obey it in the case
alike of majorities and minorities; for
it recognizes the equal rights of all its
citizens, and cannot discriminate between
them. The church that represents
for the state the spiritual order
is the church adopted by its citizens;
and as they adopt different churches,
it can recognize and enforce, through
the civil courts, the canons and decrees
of each only on its own members,
and on them only so far as they
do not infringe on the equal rights of
the others. This is not all the state
would do or ought to do in a perfect
Christian society, but it is all that it
can do where these different churches
exist, and exist for it with equal
rights. It can only recognize them,
and protect and vindicate the rights
of each only in relation to those citizens
who acknowledge its authority.
This recognizes and protects the Catholic
Church in her entire freedom
and independence and in teaching
her faith, and in governing and disciplining
Catholics according to her
own canons and decrees, which, unless
we are greatly misinformed, is
more than the state does for her, in
any old Catholic nation in the world.</p>

<p>This is not tolerance or indifference;
it only means that the state
does not arrogate to itself the right
to decide which is the true church,
and holds itself bound to respect and
protect equally the church or churches
acknowledged as such by its citizens.
The doctrine that a man is
free before God to be of any religion,
or of no religion as he pleases, or the
liberty of conscience, as understood
by the so-called liberals throughout
the world, and which was condemned
by Gregory XVI. of immortal memory,
in his encyclical of August 15th,
1832, receives no countenance from
the American state, and is repugnant
to its fundamental constitution. Heretical
and schismatic sects have, indeed,
no rights; for they have no
authority from God to represent the
spiritual order, and their existence is,
no doubt, repugnant to the real interests
of society as well as destructive
to souls; but in a community where
they exist along with the true church,
the state must respect and protect in
them the rights of the spiritual order,
not indeed because they claim to be
the church, but because they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
held to be such by its citizens, and
all its citizens have equal rights in
the civil order, and the equal right to
have their conscience, if they have a
conscience, respected and protected.
The church of God exacts nothing
more of it in this respect than to be protected
in her freedom to combat and
vanquish the adherents of false churches
or false religions with her own spiritual
weapons. More she might exact
of the state in perfect Christian
society; but this is all that she can
exact in an imperfect and divided
Christian society, as is the case in
nearly all modern nations.</p>

<p>This is the American system. Is
it practicable in the old Catholic nations
of Europe? Would it be a
gain to religion, if suffered to be introduced
there? Would the government,
if it were accepted by the church,
understand it as implying its obligation
to respect and protect all churches
equally as representing the spiritual
order, or as asserting its freedom to
govern and oppress all at will, the
true church as the false? There is
danger of the latter, because European
society is not based on the
Christian principle of the independence
and inviolability of the rights
of man, that is, the rights of God,
but on the pagan principle of the
state, that all rights, even the rights
of the church, and society emanate
from the state, and are revocable at
its will. Hence the reason why the
church has found concordats with
the secular powers so necessary. In
the sense of the secular authority,
these concordats are acts of incorporation,
and surrendering them by the
church would be the surrender of its
charter by a corporation. It would be
to abandon all her goods to the state,
leave her without a legal <i>status</i>, and
with no rights which the state holds
itself bound to recognize, protect, or
enforce through its courts, any more
than she had under the persecuting
Roman emperors. This would be the
farthest remove possible from the
American system. Before the American
system could be introduced into
European states in the respect that it
affords freedom and protection to the
church in the discharge of her spiritual
functions, the whole structure of
European society would need to be
reconstructed on the Christian foundation,
or the basis of the inherent
rights and supremacy of the spiritual
order, instead of its present pagan
or <i>GrÃ¦co-Roman</i> basis of the supremacy
of the city or state.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the liberals, or movement
party, are, and have been, for
nearly a century, struggling by all the
means in their power, fair or foul, to
overthrow European society, and reconstruct
it after what they suppose to
be the American model, but in reality
on a basis, if possible, more pagan
and less Christian than its present basis.
They assert the absolute supremacy
of the state in all things; only,
instead of saying with Louis XIV.,
"L'Ã©tat, c'est moi," they say "L'Ã©tat,
c'est le peuple," but they make the people,
as the state, as absolute as any
king or kaiser-state ever pretended to
be. The church would, in their reconstructed
society, not have secured to
her the rights that she holds under
our system, by the fact that it is based
on the equal and antecedent rights
of all citizens, really the rights of
God, which limit the power of state,
of the people in a democratic state,
and prescribe both its province and
its duty.</p>

<p>Even with us, the American system
has its enemies, and perhaps only a
minority of the people understand it
as we do, and some of the courts are
beginning to render decisions which,
if in one part, they sustain it, in another
part flatly contradict it. The Supreme
Court of Ohio, in the recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
case of the School Board of Cincinnati,
has decided very properly that
the board could not exclude religion;
but, on the other hand, it maintains
that a majority of the people in any
locality may introduce what religion
they please, and teach it to the children
of the minority as well as to
their own, which is manifestly wrong;
for it gives the majority of the people
the power to establish their own religion,
and exclude that of the minority
when, in matters of religion, that
is, in matters of conscience, votes do
not count. My conscience, though
in a minority of one, is as sacred and
inviolable as it would be if all the
rest of the community were with me.
As in the Polish Diet, a single veto
suffices to arrest the whole action of
the state. The American democracy
is not what it was in 1776. It was
then Christian after a Protestant fashion;
it is now infected with European
liberalism, or popular absolutism;
and if we had to introduce the American
system now, we should not be
able to do it.</p>

<p>There are serious difficulties on
both sides. The church cannot confide
in the revolution, and the governments
cannot or will not protect
her, save at the expense of her independence
and freedom of action.
They, if we may believe any thing
the journals say, threaten her with
their vengeance, if she dares to make
and publish such or such a dogmatic
decision, or to define on certain points
which they think touch them, what
her faith is and always has been.
This is a manifest invasion of her
right to teach the word of God in its
integrity, and simply tells her, with
the sword suspended over her head,
that she shall teach only what is
agreeable to them, whether in God's
word or not. This insolence, this arrogant
assumption, applauded by the
universal sectarian and secular press,
if submitted to, would make the
church the mere tool of the secular
authority, and destroy all confidence
in her teaching.</p>

<p>We know not how these difficulties
on either side are to be overcome.
The church cannot continue to be
shorn of her freedom by the secular
governments, and made to conform to
their ambitious or timid politics, without
losing more and more her hold on
the European populations. Nor can
she side with the revolution without
perilling the interests of society from
which her own cannot be separated.
We see no way out of the dilemma
but for her, trusting in the divine protection,
to assert simply and energetically
her independence of both parties
alike, and confide in the faithful,
as she did in the martyr ages, and as
she does now in every heathen land.</p>

<p>We do not assume the propriety or
necessity of trying to introduce the
American system into the old world,
nor do we urge the church to break
either with the governments or with the
people; but we may, we hope, be permitted
to say that what seems to us to
be needed is, for the church to assert
her independence of both so far as
either attempts to control her in the
free discharge of her functions as the
church of God; and we think the
faithful should be prepared for the
consequences of such assertion, whatever
they may prove to be. The
church cannot fulfil her mission,
which is not confined to the Catholic
nations of Europe, but embraces the
whole world, if she is thus denied her
independence and crippled in her
freedom of action. If the assertion
of her independence in face of the
temporal order deprives her of her
legal status, and places her out of the
protection of the civil law, it perhaps
will, in the end, prove to be no serious
calamity, or at least a less evil
than her present cramped and crippled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
condition. She has held that
position heretofore, and, aided by Him
whose spouse she is, and who hath
purchased her with his precious blood,
she in that very condition conquered
and subdued the world against the
hostility of the most powerful empire
that ever existed. What she has
done once, she is no less able to do
again. The worst that the state can
do is to strip her of her temporalities,
and forbid her to preach in the name of
Jesus. The worst the revolution can
do is the same, and in its fury to
massacre bishops and priests, monks
and nuns, men and women, because
they choose to obey God rather than
men.</p>

<p>Well, all this has been more than
once. We have seen it in Ireland,
where the church was despoiled of
her revenues, the people of their
churches, schools, colleges, and religious
houses, and only not of the use
of the graveyard; where Catholic worship
was prohibited under pain of
death, and armed soldiers hunted and
shot down as a wild beast the priest
who ventured to say mass in a private
house, in a remote morass, or a cave
in the mountain, and the faithful were
slaughtered as sheep by fiery zealots or
the graceless myrmidons of power;
where not only the church was despoiled
and left naked and destitute,
but her children were also despoiled
of their estates and reduced to poverty,
while laws were devised with satanic
ingenuity and enforced with
savage ferocity to degrade and debase
them, and to prevent them from escaping
from their poverty or their enforced
secular ignorance. Yet we have
seen the faith in spite of all live and
gain on its enemies, the church survive
and even prosper; and only the last
year, when offered freely a government
subsidy for her clergy and her
services, we have seen the noble Irish
hierarchy, without a dissenting voice,
refuse it, and prefer to rely on the
voluntary offerings of the faithful to
coming under any obligation to the
temporal power.</p>

<p>In this country the people were, in
the outset, as hostile to the church as
they could be anywhere or in any age,
and they are not even yet converted,
very generally, into warm and eager
friends; yet without any public provision,
relying solely on the alms of the
faithful at home and abroad, principally
at home, the missionaries of the
cross have been sustained, the widow's
handful of meal and cruse of oil
have not failed; and yet we have
founded and sustained schools, colleges,
universities, erected convents
for men and for women, and are
erecting throughout the whole country
churches, the finest in it, and
some of which may be regarded as
architectural ornaments; and nearly
all this has been achieved within a
single lifetime.</p>

<p>Men who sit at their ease in Zion,
and find their most engrossing occupation
in solving an antiquarian problem,
or disserting on some heathen
relic just dug up, though the world
is breaking up and falling to pieces
around them, may be frightened at
the prospect of being deprived of comforts
they are used to; but let governments
and peoples do their worst,
they cannot do worse than heathen
Rome did, worse than France did in
the revolution of 1789, or England
has been doing in Ireland for three
hundred years. Fear! What is there
to fear? If God be for us, who can
be against us? The danger seems
great, no doubt, to many; but let Catholics
have the courage of their faith,
and they will no longer fear him who
can kill the body, and after that hath
no more power. The danger before
men of Christian courage will disappear
as the morning mist before the
rising sun. Can a Catholic fear poverty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
want, labor, suffering, torture,
or death in His cause who for our
sakes became poor, and had not
where to lay his head; who took the
form of a servant, and obeyed unto
death, even the death of the cross?
Know we not that Catholic faith and
Catholic charity can weary out the
most cruel and envenomed persecutors,
and in the end gain the victory
over them? If the church finds it
necessary, then, in order to maintain
her independence, to incur the hostility
of kings or peoples, and the loss
of her goods, there need be no fear;
God will not forsake her, and the charity
of the faithful never faileth.</p>

<h2>DION AND THE SIBYLS.<br />

<small>A CLASSIC, CHRISTIAN NOVEL.</small></h2>

<p class="center">BY MILES GERALD KEON, COLONIAL SECRETARY, BERMUDA, AUTHOR OF
"HARDING THE MONEY-SPINNER," ETC.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>Tiberius, when all had disappeared
along the road, suddenly stopped
in his walk.</p>

<p>His companion, toward whom he
had turned, did the same, and looked
at him with an air of expectation.</p>

<p>"I leave all details to you," said
the CÃ¦sar; "but what has to be done
is this&mdash;that youth who calls himself
Paulus Lepidus Ãmilius must be
produced as a gladiator either in the
Circus Maximus or the Statilian Amphitheatre,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
as the number of victims
may dictate. Men of noble birth
have been seen ere now upon the
sand. We will then make him show
against the best swordsmen in the
world&mdash;against Gauls, Britons, and
Cappadocians&mdash;what that Greek fence
is worth of which he seems a master.
The girl, his sister, must be carried
off, either beforehand or afterward,
as your skill may dictate, and softly
and safely lodged at Rome in that
two-storied brick house of Cneius Piso
and his precious wife, Plancina, which
is not known to be mine; (I believe
and hope, and am given to understand,
that it is not known to be theirs neither.)"</p>

<p>Tiberius paused, and Sejanus, with
an intent look, slightly inclined his
head. He was a keen man, a subtle
man, but not a very profound man.
He observed,</p>

<p>"I have heard something of this
Greek widow and of her son and
daughter. They have (it seems to
me as if I had heard this) friends near
the person of Augustus, or, at least,
in the court. I can easily cause the
girl to be so carried off that no rumor
about the place of her residence will
ever more sound among men. But
the very mystery of it will sound, and
that loudly; and her mother and
brother will never cease to pierce the
ears of Augustus with their cries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
But, before I say a word more, I wish
to know two things&mdash;first, whether
this youth Paulus is to be included in
one of those great shows of gladiators
which are rendering you, my CÃ¦sar,
so beloved by the Roman people?"</p>

<p>"Am I beloved, think you?" asked
Tiberius.</p>

<p>"The master-passion of the people
is for the shows, and, above all, the
fights of the amphitheatre," answered
Sejanus. "Whoever has, for a hundred
years and more, obtained the
mastery of the world, has thus won
the Romans; each succeeding dictator
of the globe, from Caius Marius,
and Sylla, and Pompey, and the invincible
Caius Julius, and Mark Antony,
to our present happy Emperor
Augustus, has surpassed his predecessors
in the magnificence of these
entertainments given to people, populace,
common legionaries, and prÃ¦torians;
and in exact proportion also,
it is remarkable, has each surpassed
his forerunners in permanent power,
until that power has at last become
nearly absolute, nearly unlimited."</p>

<p>"You say true," replied Tiberius;
"and I excel all former examples in
the extent, splendor, and novelty of
my shows. Augustus has abandoned
that department; but even when he
was courting the Romans, he never
<i>edited</i> like me. People would now
smile at the old-fashioned meanness
of the spectacles which he formerly
made acceptable to them. He is
breaking very fast in health too, I
fear, my Sejanus."</p>

<p>"He is, I fear, drawing toward his
end," replied the commander of the
prÃ¦torians.</p>

<p>"As to your question concerning
this youth," resumed Tiberius, "my
object is partly to add a novel and
curious feature to the fight&mdash;this
strange sword-play. Yet, why should
he not afterward be included in
some great slaughter-match, three or
four hundred a side, care being taken
that he should be finished? We
might first pit him fairly against six
or a dozen single antagonists in succession.
If he conquer them all, it
will be unprecedentedly amusing;
the people will be in ecstasies, and
then the victor can be made to disappear
in the general conflict. I shall
thus have the undisturbed management
of his sister's education."</p>

<p>Grave as a statue, Sejanus replied,</p>

<p>"He is a proud youth, an equestrian,
a patrician, son of an eminent
warrior, nephew of one who once
shared in the government of the whole
globe. Well, not being a slave, if he
found himself in the arena by virtue
of having been violently seized and
trepanned, I firmly believe that, either
before or after fighting, he would
make a speech, appealing to the justice
of the emperor and the sympathy
of the people, not to say any thing
about the soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The plan you
propose, my CÃ¦sar, seems like furnishing
him with an immense audience
and a gigantic tribunal, before
which to tell that pathetic story about
his father and the battle of Philippi,
and those family estates which are
now in the possession of the two
beautiful ladies whose litters have
just preceded us on the road to
FormiÃ¦."</p>

<p>Tiberius smiled, as with his head
bent down he looked at the speaker,
and thus he continued stooping, looking,
and smiling for a moment or two,
after which he said,</p>

<p>"The Tuscans are subtle, and you
are the subtlest of Tuscans; what is
best?"</p>

<p>Sejanus said, "Let the girl first be
carried away; let the mother and brother
break their hearts for her; then let
the Lanista Thellus, who is not known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>to be one of your men, but is supposed
to hire out his gladiators on his
own account, invite the youth to join
his <i>familia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> or company, and when
Paulus refuses, as he will refuse, let
Thellus say that he knows money
would not bribe Paulus, but that he
has seen Paulus's sister; that he can
guide him to her, if Paulus consents
to fight in the next great forthcoming
shows. And, in short, in order to
make all this more specious, let Thellus
have formed the acquaintance of
the half-Greek family, mother, sister,
brother, before the girl is abducted,
in order that Paulus may think he
speaks the truth when afterward saying
that he has seen the sister and
knows her, and can guide Paulus to
where she is detained. If this plan
be adopted, Paulus will fight in the
arena of <em>his own accord</em>, and will make
no speeches, no disturbance, but will
disappear for ever in a decorous and
legitimate manner."</p>

<p>"You are a man of immense merit,
my Sejanus," replied the personage in
gore-colored purple, "and I will some
day reward you more than I can do
while merely the CÃ¦sar of an Augustus,
whom may the gods protect.
The mother perhaps we can let alone,
or she could be put on board a corsair
as an offering to some god, to procure
me good fortune in other things.
We shall see. Meanwhile, execute
all the rest with as little delay as the
order and priority of the several matters,
one before the other, will allow,
and report to me punctually at every
step."</p>

<p>Beckoning to one of the troopers,
who approached with the spare horse,
Tiberius now mounted. The soldier
immediately withdrew again, and Tiberius
said to the prÃ¦torian commander,
"Be upon your guard with Paterculus;
he is doubtless devoted to me,
but is a squeamish man; clever, indeed,
too. Still there are clever fools, my
Sejanus."</p>

<p>Then waving his hand, he rode slowly
away, but came to a halt at a distance
of twenty paces, and turned his
horse's head round. Sejanus strode
quickly toward his master.</p>

<p>"You know, of course, that the
Germans, encouraged by the slaughter
of Varus and his legions, are
swarming over the Julian Alps into
the north-east of Italy from Illyricum.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
How many legions are there
available to meet them?"</p>

<p>"We have within reach, at this moment,
twelve," said Sejanus, "besides
my prÃ¦torians."</p>

<p>"Half the present forces of the
whole empire," replied the other.
"Germanicus is to drive back the
barbarians. He will become more
popular than ever with the troops generally.
But the prÃ¦torians do not
care for him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Even the prÃ¦torians revere him,"
answered Sejanus.</p>

<p>"Why, how so? They have so little
to do with him."</p>

<p>"They know a soldier&mdash;" began
Sejanus.</p>

<p>"And am not I a soldier?" interrupted
his master.</p>

<p>"They love you too, my CÃ¦sar,
and dearly."</p>

<p>"Peace! Tell me exactly; what
think the prÃ¦torians of Germanicus?"</p>

<p>"They foolishly think that, since
the day when Caius Julius was murdered,
no such soldier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough! Foolishly, say you?
Remember my instructions. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vale!</i>"
And Tiberius galloped north, his face
ablaze with a brick-red flush deeper
than ordinary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>Sejanus, when left alone, motioned
to the two troopers. He who had
brought Tiberius his horse rode furiously
after the CÃ¦sar; the other attended
the general, who slowly mounted
his own steed, and, pursuing the
same direction, began to trot leisurely
toward FormiÃ¦. The sun had
gone down; the short twilight had
passed away; clouds had gathered,
and the moon, not having yet risen,
the night was very black. In a few
minutes Sejanus slackened his horse's
pace from a trot to a walk, and the
orderly, as his military attendant
would in modern times be called,
nearly rode against him in the dark.
The man made some natural excuse,
and fell back again about thirty
paces.</p>

<p>Sejanus hardly noticed him.</p>

<p>"At present," he muttered, when
again alone, "Tiberius, though a
CÃ¦sar, needs me; Germanicus is
CÃ¦sar too, and may become emperor.
If Germanicus wished it, right
or wrong&mdash;if <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per fas et nefas</i>&mdash;he
would win. He has much of the
genius of Caius Julius and his defect
of overtrustfulness; but none of his
many vices. I doubt if he will ever
be emperor; he is too Athenian, and
also too honorable, too disinterested.
Somehow I feel, too, as if he were
going to be assassinated; he believes
readily in men. Tiberius has smaller
abilities, worse qualities, and better
chances. He will rule the world,
and Ãlius Sejanus will rule him."</p>

<p>As Sejanus said these things to
himself in an indistinct murmur, of
which none could have heard the
precise words, a voice at his elbow
astonished him. Said the voice,</p>

<p>"How far is it, illustrious general,
to FormiÃ¦?"</p>

<p>The prÃ¦torian chief turned with a
start, and saw that the speaker was a
mounted traveller, attended by two
servants, also on horseback; but there
was so little light that he could not
distinguish the stranger's features, nor
more of his dress and appointments
than that they were not, as it seemed,
Italian.</p>

<p>"About five thousand paces," he
answered. "However, there is no
inn at FormiÃ¦. Some eight hundred
paces from here is a good wayside tavern,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mansio</i>.) But you call me general,
for I wear the dress. You do not,
however, know me."</p>

<p>"Not know the distinguished chief
of the prÃ¦torians? Not know the
happy and unhappy, the fortunate
and unfortunate Sejanus?"</p>

<p>"Happy and unhappy," reÃ«choed
the latter, "fortunate and unfortunate!
What means this jargon? You could
use that language of every mortal.
What you say you unsay."</p>

<p>While thus replying, he endeavored
to discern the dim features of his
new companion.</p>

<p>"Think you so?" said the man.
"Then, pray, would it be the same
if I were to say, for example, unhappy
and happy, unfortunate and fortunate?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Alas! no."</p>

<p>"What!" said Sejanus. "The
happiness is present, the good fortune
is present, but the misfortune and unhappiness
are to come. Is this your
meaning?"</p>

<p>"As I always say what I mean,"
rejoined the other, "so I never explain
what I say."</p>

<p>"Then at least," observed Sejanus,
with great haughtiness of tone and
manner, "you will be good enough
to say who you are. As the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">PrÃ¦tor
Peregrinus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> especially charged to
look after foreigners, I demand your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>name. Remember, friend, that six
lictors, as well as twenty thousand
soldiers, obey Sejanus."</p>

<p>"I am the god Hermes," replied
the other, riding suddenly ahead, followed
by both his attendants.</p>

<p>The movement was so unexpected
that the figure of the stranger had
become almost indistinguishable in
the obscurity, before Sejanus urged
his fleet Numidian steed forward at a
bound in pursuit.</p>

<p>"Take care," said a voice in his
front, "that your horse do not throw
you, impious man!"</p>

<p>At the same time, the prÃ¦torian
leader heard something roll upon the
paved road, and immediately a vivid
flash blazed under his horse's eyes,
and a sharp report followed. Nearly
thrown, indeed, he was, as the voice
had warned him. When he had recovered
his balance and quieted the
startled beast he was riding, he halted
to listen; but the only sound he could
now hear was that of the mounted
trooper trotting after him along the
Appian Way. He waited for this man
to come up, and inquired what he
had observed in the three strangers
who had previously passed him on
the road.</p>

<p>"No stranger," said the man, "had
passed him; he had seen no one."</p>

<p>Then Sejanus remembered what he
had not at the moment adverted
to, that neither when first accosted
by the stranger, nor afterward while
this person with his two attendants rode
by his side, nor finally when they all
galloped forward and were lost in the
darkness, had any clatter of hoofs
been audible.</p>

<p>He resumed his journey in silent
thought, and soon arrived, without
further adventure, at the large and
famous post-house, standing in those
days four or five miles south of
FormiÃ¦.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>The post house, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mansio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> to
which allusion has been made, situated
about four or five miles south of
FormiÃ¦, on the Appian road, was a
large, rambling, two-storied <i>brick</i>
house, capable of accommodating a
vast number of travellers. It was
not, therefore, merely one of the
many relay-houses where the imperial
couriers, as well as all who could produce
a special warrant for the purpose,
from a consul, or a prÃ¦tor, or even a
quÃ¦stor, were allowed to obtain a
change of horses; still less was it one
of the low canal-town taverns, whose
keepers Horace abused; but it was a
regular country inn, where man and
beast found shelter for the apparently
infinitesimal charge of one <i>as</i>, (or not
quite a penny,) and good cheer at
proportionably moderate cost. It was
well supplied from its own farm-yards,
olive-groves, orchards, vineyards, pastures,
and tilled fields, with vegetables,
beef, mutton, poultry, geese, ducks,
attagens, and other meats; eggs, wine,
butter, cheese, milk, honey, bread,
and fruit; a delicious plate of fish occasionally,
an equally delicious array
of quail, produced upon table in a
state aromatic and frothy with their
own fat juices.</p>

<p>This excellent and celebrated house
of entertainment for belated or way-worn
travellers, as well as for all who
desired a change from the monotony
of their usual life, was kept by a remarkably
worthy old couple, formerly
slaves, a freedman and freedwoman
of the illustrious Ãmilian family.
The reader will have noticed that the
youth whom it is necessary, we suppose,
to acknowledge in the capacity
of our hero, has been called Paulus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>Ãmilius Lepidus; that his father had
borne the same style; and likewise
that his father's brother, the former
sovereign magistrate or triumvir in
the second and great triumvirate, was
named Marcus Ãmilius Lepidus. In
all these names, that of Ãmilius occurs;
and Ãmilius was the noblest
of the patronymics which once this
great family boasted. Now, theirs
had been the house in which Crispus
and Crispina, the good innkeeper and
his wife, at present free and prosperous,
had been boy and girl slaves.
The wife, indeed, had been nurse to
a son of Marcus Lepidus, the triumvir.</p>

<p>That son, some years before the
date of our narrative, had been engaged
in a conspiracy against Augustus;
and the conspiracy having been
discovered by MÃ¦cenas, the youth
had been put to death. Marcus
Ãmilius Lepidus, the father, was exculpated
from all knowledge of this
attempt on the part of his son, but
had ever since lived in profound retirement
at a lonely sea-shore castle
some twenty or thirty miles from
Crispus's inn, near Monte Circello;
a silent, brooding, timid man, no
longer very wealthy, entirely without
weight in the society which he had
abandoned, and without any visible
influence in the political world, from
which he had fled in some terror and
immense disgust.</p>

<p>As Sejanus rode slowly up to the
inn-door, a centurion came out of the
porch with the air of one who had
been waiting for him. Saluting the
general, this officer said that he had
been left behind by Velleius Paterculus
to say that the sister of the
youth whom Tiberius had placed under
the charge of Paterculus had
fainted on the road; that being unable
to proceed, she and her mother
had taken a lodging in the inn; that
the youth had at once begged Paterculus
to allow him to remain instead
of proceeding to FormiÃ¦, in order
that he might attend to his poor sister,
for whose life he was alarmed,
giving his promise that he would
faithfully report himself, and not attempt
to escape; that Paterculus
considered himself justified, under the
circumstances, in acceding to so natural
a request; consequently, that the
young man was now in the inn, along
with his mother and sister; and that
he, the centurion, had been ordered
to await Sejanus's arrival, and inform
him of what had occurred, so that he
might either confirm his subordinate's
decision, or repair the mistake, if it
was one, and cause the youth to go
forward at once to FormiÃ¦ according
to the letter of Tiberius's original
command.</p>

<p>"It is well," said Sejanus, after a
moment's reflection. "This is not
the sort of lad who will break his
word. Carthaginians, and rubbish
like them, knew long ago how to believe
a Roman knight and patrician,
and this lad seems to be of the Regulus
breed. Does the CÃ¦sar himself,
however, know of this?"</p>

<p>"I had no orders to tell him,"
answered the centurion; "and if I had
had, it would have been difficult; he
passed at full gallop a quarter of an
hour ago, his head down, not so
much as looking aside."</p>

<p>Sejanus then put the following
question with a sneer,</p>

<p>"Has a god, or a stranger, with
two attendants on horseback, passed
this way?"</p>

<p>"No god, unless he be a god, and
he had no attendants," said the astonished
centurion.</p>

<p>"You have not seen three figures
on horseback, nor a flash of bluish
light?"</p>

<p>"I certainly thought I saw three
figures on horseback, but I could not
be sure. It was on the farther side
of the way, general, which is broad,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
continued the man apologetically,
"and there was no sound of hoofs;
my impression, too, was gone in a
moment. As to a flash of bluish
light, there are several flashes of red
and white light inside the inn kitchen,
and they make the road outside all
the darker; but there has been no
flash in the road."</p>

<p>"Good! now follow me."</p>

<p>And Sejanus rode on in the direction
of FormiÃ¦, the centurion and the
soldier behind him.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>The inn, it is well ascertained,
never became a common institution
in classic antiquity. It was utterly
unknown in any thing like its modern
shape among the Greeks; one cause
being that the literary Greeks gave
less care to their roads and communications
than the administrating, fighting,
conquering, and colonizing Romans
always did. Even among the
Romans the army trusted to its city-like
encampments from stage to stage.
Centuries passed away, during which
the private traveller found few indeed,
and far between, any better public
resting-houses along the magnificent
and stupendous highways, whose remains
we still behold indestructible,
from England to Asia Minor, than
the half-day relay-posts, or <i>mutationes</i>.
At these the wayfarer, by
producing<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> his <i>diploma</i> from the proper
authorities, obtained a change of
horses.</p>

<p>Travelling, in short, was a thousand-fold
less practised than it is
among us; and those who did travel,
or who deemed it likely they ever
should, trusted to that hospitality
which necessity had made universal,
and the poetry of daily life had raised
by repute into one of the greatest virtues.
Years before any member of
your family, supposing you to belong
to the age through which the events
of this narrative are carrying and to
carry us, years before any of your circle
quitted your roof, you knew to
what house, to what smoky hearth in
each foreign land, to what threshold
in Spain, Gaul, Syria, Egypt, Greece,
the wanderer would eventually resort.
A certain family in each of these and
other lands was your <i>hospes</i>, and you
were theirs; and very often you carried
round your neck, attached to a
gold or silver chain, a bit of elder or
oak (<i>robur</i>) notched and marked by
the natural breakage, the corresponding
half of which hung day and night
round the neck of some friend living
thousands of miles away, beyond rivers,
mountains, wild forests, and raging
seas. These tokens were the
cheap lodging-money of friendship.
Very often they were interchanged
and put on in boyhood, and not presented
till advanced age. He who had
thrown the sacred symbol round the
curly head of his playmate on the
banks of the Tiber, saw an old man
with scanty white hair approach him,
half a century afterward, at Alexandria,
or Numantia, or Athens, and
offer him a little bit of wood, the fracture?
of which were found to fit into
those of a similar piece worn upon
his own bosom. Or the son brought
the father's token; or a son received
what a father had given. And the
stranger was forthwith joyfully made
welcome, and took rank among dear
friends. Forthwith the bath and the
supper introduced him to his remote
home amid foreign faces. To be once
unfaithful to these pledges, was to become
irreparably infamous. The caitiff
who thus sundered the lies of traditionary
and necessity-caused and
world-wide kindness, became an object
of scorn and reprobation to all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
It was enough to mention of him,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tesseram confregit hospitalem</i>, ("<i>that
man has broken his token-word of hospitality</i>;")
with that all was said.
Traces of this touching custom appear
to survive in some of the ceremonials
of rustic love, amid many a population
ignorant that the ancient Romans
ever reigned over Europe.</p>

<p>But if inns, in year eleven, were
not what they have been in mediÃ¦val
and modern Europe, nevertheless a
few existed even then, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cauponÃ¦</i>;) and
a more notable establishment of this
kind never flourished in any part of
the Roman empire than that to which
our story has now brought us. It
was the exception to manners then
prevalent, and the presage of manners
to come long afterward. It used to
be commonly called the <i>Post-House
of the Hundredth Milestone</i>, or, more
briefly, <i>Crispus's Inn</i>.</p>

<p>The public room of this place of entertainment
was not unlike the coffee-room
of a good modern inn, except
that it was necessarily far more full of
incident and interest, because the ancients
were beyond comparison more
addicted to living in public than any
modern nation has ever been.</p>

<p>An Englishman who makes a similar
remark of the French, in comparison
with his own countrymen, has
only to remember that the modern
French as much excel the ancient Romans
in fondness for retirement and
privacy and domestic life as the English
believe themselves to excel the
French in the same particular.</p>

<p>An inn did not trouble itself much
with the <i>triclinium</i>, a chamber seldom
used by its frequenters. Even the
manners of the <i>triclinium</i> were out of
vogue here.</p>

<p>In Crispus's public room, for instance,
there was one and only one
table arranged with couches around
it, upon which some three or four customers,
while eating and drinking,
could recline according to the fashion
adopted in the private houses of the
rich and noble. All the other tables
stood round the walls of the apartment,
with benches and settees on
each side, offering seats for the guests.
The inner seats at these tables were
generally preferred, for two reasons;
the occupants saw all that passed in
the room, and besides, had the wall,
against which they could lean back.</p>

<p>When Velleius Paterculus, having
left Tiberius and Sejanus in the meadows
near the Liris, took charge of
the prÃ¦torian squadrons and of Paulus,
he directed a Batavian trooper to
dismount and give his horse to the
prisoner. Paulus willingly sprung
upon the big Flemish beast, and rode
by the side of the obliging officer who
had given him that conveyance.
Thus they proceeded at an easy amble
until they reached the post-house,
to the porch of which the noise of
four thousand hoofs, suddenly approaching
along the paved road, had
brought a group of curious gazers.
Among these was the landlord, Crispus
himself.</p>

<p>A halt, as the reader must have
inferred from a former incident, was
occasioned at the door by the intimation
conveyed to Paterculus that
Paulus's sister had fainted, that she
and her mother intended to seek a
lodging at the inn, and that the
mother and brother of the invalid
would both feel grateful to the commanding
officer if he could permit
Paulus, upon pledging his word not
to make any attempt to escape, to
remain there with them.</p>

<p>"As to the ladies," said the urbane
literary soldier, "I have neither the
wish nor any orders to interfere with
their movements. But you, young
sir, what say you? Will you give
me your word to regard yourself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
being in my custody till I expressly
release you? Will you promise not
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">abire</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">evadere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excedere</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erumpere</i>,
as our friend Tully said?"</p>

<p>"Tully! Who is that?" asked our
hero.</p>

<p>"What, you a half Greek and not
know who Tully was! Is this the
manner in which Greek youths, or at
least youths in Greece, are educated!
Is it thus they are taught in Greece,
to which we go ourselves for education!
In that Greece which has forbidden
gladiatorial shows, and diminished
the training of the body to
have more time for that of the intellect!"</p>

<p>Paulus blushed, seeing he must
have betrayed some gross degree of
rusticity, and answered,</p>

<p>"I know I am ignorant: I have
been so much occupied in athletic
sports. But I will give you the
promise you ask, and keep it most
truly and faithfully."</p>

<p>"I will trust you, then. Go a
little, my friend, into the athletic
sports of the mind, which are precisely
those Greece most cultivates. You
are of a great family now fallen down.
The muscles of the arm, the strength
of the body, a blow from a cestus,
never yet raised that kind of burden
off the ground. You fence astonishingly
well&mdash;I noted your parry just
now; but the fence of the mind is every
thing, believe me. By the way, I see
the excellent Piso, whom you hammered
down after the parry, as one
puts a full stop to a pretty sentence,
is being carried into this same post-house."</p>

<p>"By your leave, illustrious sir," interposed
the innkeeper, rather nervously,
"it is scarcely the custom, is it,
to drop guests at Crispus's door, without
first asking Crispus has he room
for them? The expected visit of the
divine Augustus to the neighboring
palace of the most excellent and valiant
knight Mamurra, in FormiÃ¦, has
choked and strangled this poor house.
There is no place where the multitude
of guests can lodge in the town, so
they come hither, as to a spot at a
convenient distance. Troops of players,
troops of gladiators, troops of
fortune-tellers, troops of geese, pigs,
beeves, attagens, alive and dead, night
and day, for the last week, with
mighty personages from a distance,
make the road noisy, I assure you,
even after my house is full. I believe
they would wish me to put up the
very oxen intended for sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Have you no chambers whatever
vacant?" asked Velleius.</p>

<p>"I did not say that, most excellent
sir; vacant is one thing, disengaged
is another. I have received an express
letter from Brundusium, to say
that a certain queen out of the East,
with her son and her train, are coming
to pay their homage to the emperor:
and here we have already the servants
of that Jew king, as they say, one
King Alexander, who wants his cause
to be heard and his title settled by
Augustus himself, and I am obliged to
listen to loud outcries that he, too,
must have apartments."</p>

<p>At this moment, the travelling
carriage carrying poor Agatha and
her mother had been drawn nearly
opposite to the porch, but a little in
rear of the tribune, so as not to intercept
his conversation with the innkeeper.
Paterculus threw a quick
glance at the beautiful pallid face of
the girl, and the anxious and frightened
look of her mother.</p>

<p>"By what you tell me, worthy
Crispus," he replied, "you are so far
from having your justly celebrated
house full, that you are keeping two
sets of apartments still vacant, in expectation,
first, of some queen from
the east, with her son and train, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
secondly, of this Jewish king, one
Alexander. Worthy Libertinus,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the
fair damsel whom you see so pale, is
very sick, and has just swooned away
from sheer fatigue. Will you turn
such a daughter in such health, with
her noble mother, from your door?
A queen can take care of herself, it
seems to me. But what will become
of these excellent Roman ladies, (your
own countrywomen,) if you now bid
them begone from your threshold?
You have assured me that they can
obtain no shelter at all in FormiÃ¦.
Look at the child! She seems likely
to faint again. Are you to let this
daughter of a Roman knight die in
the fields, in order that you may have
room for a barbarian queen? You
have a daughter of your own, I am
told."</p>

<p>"Die!" groaned the innkeeper:
"all this did not come into my mind,
most illustrious tribune and quÃ¦stor.
Come, little lady, let me help you
down. This lady and her daughter,
sir, shall have the queen's own apartments&mdash;may
all the gods destroy me
otherwise! Here, Crispina."</p>

<p>Velleius Paterculus smiled, and having
whispered some order to a centurion,
who remained behind in watch
for Sejanus, the tribune waved his
hand, crying out <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vale</i> to whom it
might concern, and rode forward with
the prÃ¦torians at a much smarter pace
than they had come.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the innkeeper's wife,
Crispina, had appeared, and had led
Aglais and her daughter through the
group in the porch into the house,
and passing by a little <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">zothecula</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> behind
the curtain of which they heard
the sound of flutes,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> as the carvers
carved, and many voices, loud and
low, denoting the apartment called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dieta</i> or public room of the inn, they
soon arrived at the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">compluvium</i>, an
open space or small court, in the middle
of which was a cistern, and in
the middle of the cistern a splashing
fountain. The cistern was railed by
a circular wooden balustrade, against
which some creeping plants grew.
This cistern was supplied from the
sky; for the whole space or court in
which it lay was open and unroofed.
Between the circular wooden balustrade
and the walls of the house was,
on every side, a large quadrangular
walk, lightly gravelled, and flashing
back under the lantern which Crispina
carried, an almost metallic glint
and sparkle. Of course this walk
presented its quadrangular form on
the outer edge, next the house only;
the inside, next the cistern, was rounded
away. This quadrangular walk
was at one spot diminished in width
by a staircase in the open air, (but
under an awning,) which led up to
the second story of the large brick
building. Around the whole <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">compluvium</i>,
or court, the four inner faces
of the inn, which had four covered
lights in sconces against the walls,
were marked at irregular intervals by
windows, some of which were mere
holes, with trap-doors (in every case
open at present;) others, lattice-work,
like what, many centuries later, obtained
the name of arabesque-work,
having a curtain inside that could be
drawn or undrawn. Others again
with perforated slides; others stretched
with linen which oil had rendered
diaphanous; others fitted with thin
scraped horn; one only, a tolerably
large window, with some kind of mineral
panes more translucent than
transparent&mdash;a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapis laminata specularis</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>At the back, or west of the inn,
an irregular oblong wing extended,
which of course could not open upon
this court, but had its own means of
light and ventilation north and south
respectively.</p>

<p>Crispus had followed the group of
women, and our friend Paulus had
followed Crispus. In the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">compluvium</i>,
the innkeeper took the lantern from
his wife, and begged Aglais and Agatha
to follow him up the awning-covered
staircase. As he began to ascend,
it happened that Crispina, looking
around, noticed Paulus, who had
taken off his broad-rimmed hat, under
one of the sconces. No sooner had
her eyes rested on him than she started
violently, and grasped the balustrade
as if she would have fallen but
for that support.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said the woman.</p>

<p>"The brother of that young lady
who is ill, and the son of the other
lady."</p>

<p>"And you, too, must want lodgings?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>The woman seized his arm with a
vehement grip, and gazed at him.</p>

<p>"Are you ill?" said Paulus, "or&mdash;or&mdash;out
of your mind? Why do you
clutch my arm and look at me in that
fashion?"</p>

<p>"Too young," said she, rather to
herself than to him; "besides, I saw
the last act with these eyes. Truly
this is wonderful."</p>

<p>Then, like one waking from a dream,
she added, "Well, if you want lodgings,
you shall have them. You shall
have the apartments of this king or
pretender&mdash;the rooms prepared for
the Jew Alexander. Come with me
at once." And she unfastened the
lamp in the nearest sconce, and led
Paulus up the staircase.</p>

<p>Thus the wanderers, Aglais and her
daughter, had the queen's room, with
their Thracian slave Melana to wait
upon them, while the prisoner Paulus
had the king's, to which Crispina herself
ordered old Philip, the freedman,
to carry his luggage.</p>

<p>A few moments later, the innkeeper,
who had returned to the more
public parts of the house to attend
to his usual duties, met Philip laden
with parcels in one of the passages,
and asked him what he was doing.</p>

<p>"Carrying young Master Paulus's
things to his room."</p>

<p>"You can carry," said the innkeeper,
"whatever the ladies require to
<em>their</em> room; but your young master
has no room at all, my man, in this
house. And why? For the same
reason that will compel you to sleep
in one of the lofts over the stables.
There is no space for him in the inn.
You must make him as comfortable
as you can in the hay, just like yourself."</p>

<p>"Humanity is something," muttered
Crispus; "but to make a queen
one's enemy on that score, without
adding a king, where no humane consideration
intervenes at all, is enough
for a poor innkeeper in a single night.
These <i>tetrarchs</i> and rich barbarians
can do a poor man an ugly turn. Who
knows but he might complain of my
house to the emperor, or to one of
the consuls, or the prÃ¦tor, or even
the quÃ¦stor, and presto! every thing
is seized, and I am banished to the
Tauric Chersonese, or to Tomos in
Scythia, to drink mare's milk with the
poet Ovid."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>"Go on, freedman, with your luggage,"
here said a peremptory voice,
"and take it whither you have taken
the rest."</p>

<p>"And in the name of all the gods,
wife," cried Crispus, "whither may
that be?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>"Go on, freedman," she repeated;
and then taking her husband aside,
she spoke to him in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Have you remarked this youth's
face?" she asked; "and have you any
idea who he is?"</p>

<p>"I know not who any of them are,"
replied Crispus.</p>

<p>"Look at him then; for here he
comes."</p>

<p>Crispus looked, and as he looked
his eyes grew bigger; and again he
looked until Paulus noticed it, and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Do you know me?" says he.</p>

<p>"No, illustrious sir."</p>

<p>"Alas! I am not illustrious, good
landlord, (<i>institor</i>,) but hungry I am.
And I believe we all are, except my
poor sister, who is not very strong,
and for whom, by and by, I should
like to procure the advice of a physician."</p>

<p>"The poor young thing," said Crispina,
"is only tired with her journey;
it is nothing. She will be well to-morrow.
Supper you shall have presently
in the ante-chamber of your
mother's apartments; and your freedman
and the female slave shall be
cared for after they have waited upon
you."</p>

<p>"All this is easy and shall be seen
to forthwith," added Crispus; "but
the doctor for your dear sister, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per
omnes deos</i>, where shall we find
him?"</p>

<p>"Understand," said Paulus, "my
sister is not in immediate danger, such
as would justify calling in any empiric
at once rather than nobody. She has
been ailing for some time, and it is of
no use to send for the first common
stupid practitioner that may be in the
way. Is there not some famous doctor
procurable in Italy?"</p>

<p>"The most famous in Italy is a
Greek physician not five thousand
paces from here at this moment,"
said the landlord. "But he would
not come to every body; he is Tiberius
CÃ¦sar's own doctor."</p>

<p>"You mean Charicles," replied Paulus;
"I almost think he would come;
my mother is a Greek lady, and he
will surely be glad to oblige his countrywoman."</p>

<p>"Then write you a note to him,"
said Crispina, "and I will send it instantly."</p>

<p>Paulus thanked her, said he would,
and withdrew.</p>

<p>When he proposed to his mother
to dispatch this message to Charicles,
she hesitated much. Agatha was
better, he found her in comparatively
good spirits. It would do to send
for the doctor next day. An urgent
summons conveyed at night to the
palace or residence of the CÃ¦sar,
where Charicles would probably of
necessity be, would cause Tiberius to
inquire into the matter, and would
again draw his attention, and draw it
still more persistently to them. He
had already intimated that he would
order his physician to attend Agatha.
They did not desire to establish very
close relations with the man in black
purple.</p>

<p>It is wonderful even how that very
intimation from Tiberius had diminished
both mother's and daughter's
anxiety to consult the celebrated practitioner,
to whose advice and assistance
they had previously looked forward.
There were parties in the
court and cabals in the political
world; and among them, as it happened,
was the Greek faction, at the
head of which his ill-wishers alleged
Germanicus to be. GrÃ¦culus, or
Greek coxcomb, was one of the
names flung at him as a reproach by
his enemies. What the Scotch, and
subsequently the Irish interest may
have been at various times in modern
England, that the Greek interest was
then in Roman society. Of all men,
he who most needed to be cautious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and discreet in such a case was an adventurer
who, being himself a Greek,
owed to his personal merit and abilities
the position of emolument and
credit which he enjoyed; who was
tolerated for his individual qualities as
a foreigner, but who, if suspected of
using professional opportunities as a
political partisan, would be of no service
to others, and would merely lose
his own advantages.</p>

<p>"Let Tiberius send Charicles to
us," continued Aglais; "and our countryman
and friend may be of service
to us, even in the suit which we have
to urge at court. But were we now
to show the CÃ¦sar that we confide in
Charicles, we should only injure our
countryman and not benefit ourselves."</p>

<p>"How injure him?"</p>

<p>"Thus," replied the Greek lady.
"If your claim for the restitution of
your father's estates be not granted
for justice sake, I must make interest
in order that it may be granted for
favor's sake. As a Greek I shall be
likely to induce no powerful person
to take our claims under his protection
except Germanicus, the friend of
Athenians. Now, it is a fact which I
have learned for certain that Tiberius
hates Germanicus, whom he regards
as his rival; and that whoever is patronized
by Germanicus, him Tiberius
would gladly destroy. Behold us in
a short while the clients and retainers
of this same Germanicus, and let Tiberius
then remember that his own
physician has been, and continues to
be, intimate and confidential with this
brood of the Germanicus faction.
Would not Charicles be damaged,
perhaps endangered? But if we wait
until the CÃ¦sar himself sends us the
doctor, as he said he would, we may
then gain by it, and our friend not
lose."</p>

<p>"Mother, you are indeed Greek,"
said Paulus, laughing; "and as Agatha
is in no actual danger, be it as
you say. Do you know, sister, there
is nothing the matter with you but
fatigue and fright? I am sure of it.
You will recover rapidly now, with
rest, peace, and safety."</p>

<p>"Mother," says Agatha, smiling,
"we have forgotten, amid all this
consultation about my health, to tell
brother the curious discovery I have
just made."</p>

<p>"True," said Aglais; "your sister
has explored a very odd fact indeed."</p>

<p>"Why, brother," says Agatha, "we
found you in this large sitting-room,
when we entered, though we had left
you below-stairs, near the cistern."</p>

<p>"Found me?" said Paulus.</p>

<p>"Yes," added his mother; "found
you concealed in this room by Tiberius."</p>

<p>"Concealed by Tiberius?"</p>

<p>"I will not leave you in suspense
any longer," said the young girl, laughing.
"Look here." And she led him
to a table behind the bench on which
she had been sitting, and directed his
attention to a bust, or rather a head
of Tiberius, modelled or moulded in
some sort of pottery.</p>

<p>"That," said she, "when I first sat
down, stood upon yonder table opposite
to us. I recognized the face of
the man who had spoken to me under
the chestnut-trees, just before you assisted
me back to the carriage. I abhor
the wicked countenance; and not
choosing to let it stare at me like a
dream where it was, I rose and went
to remove it to the stand where you
now see it, behind my bench. Well,
only think! I took it, so, with my
hands, one under each ear, and lifted
it; when, lo! it came away, and left
your own dear face looking at us,
thus!"</p>

<p>As she spoke, she again lifted the
<i>terra cotta</i> face, and beneath it a much
smaller and more elegant piece of
sculpture in white marble was disclosed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
presenting the lineaments and image
of Paulus himself. He started,
and then his sister replaced the mask
of Tiberius with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Was I not speaking true when I
said that Tiberius had concealed you
here?" said his mother.</p>

<p>"The CÃ¦sar, very true, has me in
his head, and well secured," said Paulus.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened,
and Crispina entered to ask whether
the letter for the physician was ready.
They told her they had changed their
minds, and would not, at least that
night, send any letter, Agatha felt and
looked so much better.</p>

<p>"Then I will at once order your
supper to be brought," said Crispina;
"and as you are evidently people of
distinction, would you like music while
the meats are carved?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said the Greek
lady.</p>

<p>"Not a carver neither, mother?"
interposed Agatha; and, turning to
the hostess, she begged that they
might be treated as quietly and let
alone as much as it was possible.</p>

<p>"That is indeed our desire," said
the Greek lady.</p>

<p>"In that case," replied the hostess,
"my own daughter, Benigna, shall
attend to you. Nobody shall trouble
you. You are in the rear or west
wing of the house, far away from all
the noise of our customers, who are
sometimes, I confess, sufficiently uproarious.
But Crispus is not afraid
of them. When to-morrow's sun rises,
you will be glad to find what a
beautiful country extends beneath your
windows, even to the waters of the
Tyrrhenian Sea. You will behold,
first, a garden and bee-hive; beyond
these are orchards; beyond them fields
of husbandry and pleasant pasture
lands, with not a human figure to be
seen except knots and dots of work-people,
a few shepherds, and perhaps
an angler amusing himself on the
banks of the Liris in the distance."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Agatha, "I wish soon
to go to sleep, that we may set out
quickly toward that beautiful country
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Will you not like a little bit of something
very nice for supper first, my precious
little lady?" quoth the good hostess;
"and that will make you sleep
all the better, and from the moment
when you close your pretty eyes in rest
and comfort under poor Crispina's
roof, to the moment when you open
them upon those lovely scenes, you
won't be able to count one, two,
three&mdash;but just only one&mdash;and presto!
there's to-morrow morning for you!"</p>

<p>Agatha declared that this was very
nice; and that supper would be nice;
and that every thing was comfortable;
the rooms particularly so.</p>

<p>"Then a delicious little supper shall
be got ready at once," said Crispina.
"I'll call my brisk Benigna to help
me."</p>

<p>Before quitting the room, however,
the landlady, whose glance had rested
chiefly upon Paulus during the conversation,
threw up her hands a little
way. She then composed herself, and
addressing Aglais, asked,</p>

<p>"What names, lady, shall I put
down in my book?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you when you return,"
replied Aglais; and the landlady retired.</p>

<h2>SIR JOHN MAUNDEVILLE.</h2>


<p>"Of Paradise I cannot speak properly,
for I was not there. It is far
beyond, and I repent not going there;
but I was not worthy." So wrote,
more than five hundred years ago, an
honest English knight who had spent
some ten years journeying through
that "most worthy land, most excellent
and lady and sovereign of all
other lands," which was "blessed
and hallowed with the most precious
body and blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ;" visiting portions of Africa
and Asia; and picking up from all
accessible sources legends and marvels,
and scraps of the geography and
history of distant countries. For
something like two centuries the
travels of Sir John Maundeville enjoyed
a tremendous popularity; and
though time can hardly be said to
have improved the good gentleman's
reputation for veracity and judgment,
it has perhaps heightened rather than
diminished the interest of his narrative.
Alas! we can never know such
travellers again. Men who go to
Palestine in a steamboat, and are
whirled by locomotives into the very
presence of the Sphinx, bring us back
no wonderful stories of the mysterious
East, with its dragons and enchanters,
and its sacred places miraculously
barred against profane footsteps.
Travel has no mysteries now. What
is the earthly paradise but a Turkish
pashalic? What is Prester John but
a petty negro chieftain? And for
dragons and chimÃ¦ras dire, has not
any good museum of natural history
specimens of them all, nicely stuffed
and labelled, or bottled in alcohol?
In the days of Sir John, however,
wonders were plenty; and if he did
not see very many himself, he heard
of men who had seen no end of them,
and he described them all the same.
It was from hearsay, and not from
personal observation, that he learned
of the Lady of the Land, in the island
of Cos, then called Lango. This
wonderful lady was the daughter of
Ypocras or Hippocrates, in form and
likeness of a great dragon which is a
hundred fathoms in length, "as they
say," adds Sir John, "for I have not
seen her." She lies in an old castle
in a cave, appearing twice or thrice
in a year, and condemned "by a goddess
named Diana" to remain in that
horrible shape until a knight shall
come and kiss her on the mouth;
then she shall resume her natural
form, and the knight shall marry her
and be lord of the isles. Many have
tempted the adventure, but fled in
affright when they have seen her.
And every knight who once looks
upon her and flees, must die anon.</p>

<p>At Ephesus the traveller beheld the
tomb of St. John the Evangelist, and
heard the familiar story that the
apostle had entered the sepulchre
alive, and was still living, in accordance
with the saying of our Lord,
"So I will have him to remain till I
come, what is that to thee?" "And
men may see there the earth of the
tomb many times openly stir and
move, as though there were living
things under." To say nothing else
of this story, it is not fully consistent
with Sir John's other statement, that
the tomb contains nothing but manna,
"which is called angels' meat,"
for the body was translated to paradise.
Quite as great are the wonders
of Joppa, "which is one of the
oldest towns in the world; for it was
founded <i>before Noah's flood</i>." Strangely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
confusing the legend of Perseus
and Andromeda, our traveller relates
that in a rock near Joppa may still be
seen marks of the iron chains "wherewith
Andromeda, a great giant, was
bound and put in prison before Noah's
flood; a rib of whose side, which is
forty feet long, is still shown." Sir
John spent a long time in the service
of the sultan of Egypt, where he
seems to have anticipated modern researches
into the source of the Nile;
for he confidently assures us that it
rises in the garden of Eden, and
after descending upon earth, flows
through many extensive countries under
ground, coming out beneath a
high hill called Alothe, between India
and Ethiopia, and encircling the
whole of Ethiopia and Mauritania,
before it enters the land of Egypt.
To the best of our belief, the travels
of Dr. Livingstone have not fully
confirmed this interesting geographical
statement. The sultan dwells at
a city called Babylon, which is not,
however, the great Babylon where the
diversity of languages was first made
by the miracle of God. That Babylon
is forty days' journey across the
desert, in the territory of the king of
Persia. The Tower of Babel was
ten miles square, and included many
mansions and dwellings; "but it is
full long since any man dare approach
to the tower, for it is all desert, and
full of dragons and great serpents, and
infested by divers venomous beasts."
Sir John, therefore, is probably not
responsible for the extraordinary measurement
of its walls. Whether his
account of the phoenix is based upon
his personal observations, we are not
told; but it is highly interesting. There
is only one phoenix in the world. It
is a very handsome and glorious bird,
with a yellow neck, blue beak, purple
wings, and a red and yellow tail, and
may often be seen flying about the
country. It lives five hundred years,
and at the end of that time comes to
burn itself on the altar of the temple
of Heliopolis, where the priests prepare
for the occasion a fire of spices
and sulphur. The next day they find
in the ashes a worm. On the second
day the worm becomes a live and
perfect bird; and the third day it flies
away. A plenty of fine things, indeed,
Egypt could boast of in those
days, far before any thing she has
now. There were gardens bearing
fruit seven times a year. There were
the apples of paradise, which, cut
them how you would, or as often as
you would, always showed in the middle
the figure of the holy cross. There
was the apple-tree of Adam, whose
fruit invariably had a mouthful bitten
out of one side. There is a field
containing seven wells, which the
child Jesus made with one of his feet
while at play with his companions.
There are the granaries in which Joseph
stored corn for the season of famine,
(probably the Pyramids.) And
passing out of Egypt across the desert
of Arabia, Sir John tells of the
wonderful monastery on Mount Sinai,
whither the ravens, crows, and choughs
and other fowls of that country, assembling
in great flocks, come every
year on pilgrimage to the tomb of
St. Catharine, each bringing a branch
of bays or olive, so that from these
offerings the monks have enough to
keep themselves constantly supplied
with oil. There are no such foul
venomous beasts as flies, toads, lizards,
lice, or fleas in this monastery;
for once upon a time, when
the vermin had become too thick
there to be endured, the good brethren
made preparations to move away,
whereupon our Lady commanded
them to remain and no pest of that
sort should ever again come near
them. On Mount Mamre, near Hebron,
Sir John saw an oak-tree which
had been standing since the creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of the world. Oaks nowadays don't
live to such a great age. This tree
had borne no leaves since the crucifixion,
(when all the trees in the world
withered away,) but it had still so
much virtue that a scrap of it healed
the falling-sickness, and prevented
founder in horses.</p>

<p>Armed with a letter under the sultan's
great seal, Sir John went to Jerusalem,
and was admitted to all the
holy shrines from which Christians
and Jews were usually excluded. He
saw, or believed he saw, the spots
sanctified by almost all the great
events narrated in the Gospel; and
though his credulity, as may be inferred
from what we have already
seen of his narrative, often got the
better of his judgment, his piety, at
any rate, deserves our genuine respect.
We pass over his legends of
this holy city, some of them poetical,
some merely grotesque, and some really
sanctioned by the general voice
of the church, and go with him eastward
to the valley of Jordan and the
Dead Sea. Of this mysterious body
of water he mentions that it casts
out every day "a thing that is called
asphalt in pieces as large as a horse,"
and neither man, nor beast, nor any
thing that hath life may die in that
sea, which hath been proved many
times by the experiment of criminals
condemned to death who have been
left therein three or four days, and
yet taken out alive. If any man cast
iron therein, it will float; but a feather
will sink to the bottom; "and these
things," truly remarks Sir John, "are
contrary to nature." Not more so,
perhaps, than an incident of which
he speaks at the city of Tiberias. In
that city an unbeliever hurled a burning
dart at our Lord, "and the head
smote into the earth, and waxed green,
and it grew to a great tree; and it
grows still, and the bark thereof is
all like coals." Then, near Damascus
there is a church, and behind the
altar, in the wall, "a table of black
wood on which was formerly painted
an image of our Lady which turns
into flesh; but now the image appears
but little." As a compensation, however,
for its loss, a certain wonderful
oil, as Sir John assures us, drops continually
from the wood and heals many
kinds of sickness, and if any one
keep it cleanly for a year, after that
year it turns to flesh and blood. In
this same region of marvels he tells
us of a river which runs only on Saturday,
and stands still all the rest of
the week, and another which freezes
wonderfully fast every night, and is
clear of ice in the morning. These
rivers are not known nowadays, or
at any rate must have changed their
habits.</p>

<p>After finishing the description of
the Holy Land and Babylon, and reporting
a conversation with the sultan,
in which the vices of the Christians,
such as drinking at taverns, and
fighting, and perpetually changing the
fashion of their clothes, were sharply
satirized, and giving a synopsis of the
Mohammedan creed, which we fear
is not altogether authentic, our worthy
traveller adds that now is the time,
if it please us, to tell of the borders,
and isles, and divers beasts, and of
various peoples beyond these borders.
Accepting his invitation, we bear him
company first to the land of Lybia,
which must have been a most uncomfortable
region in those days, for the
sea there was higher than the land,
and the sun was so hot that the
waters were always boiling. Why the
country was not, therefore, soused in
a steaming, hissing flood, we do not
know; 'Sir John himself evidently
thinks it strange. In Little Ermony
which we take to be Armenia,
he found something almost equally
strange. That was the Castle of the
Sparrow-hawk, where a sparrow-hawk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
perpetually sat upon a fair perch and
a fair lady of fairie guarded it. Whoever
will watch the bird seven days
and seven nights without company
and without sleep, shall be granted by
the fairy the first earthly wish that he
shall wish; but if sleep overcome him,
he will never more be seen of men.
This, adds the careful traveller, hath
been proved oftentimes, and he mentions
several persons who performed
the long task and got their wishes.
Mount Ararat is another marvellous
feature in this wonderful region; for
it is seven miles high, and Noah's ark
still rests upon it, and in clear weather
may be seen afar off. Some men say
that they have been up and touched
the ark, and even put their fingers in
the parts where the devil went out
when Noah said "Benedicite," (unfortunately
we do not know the
legend to which this refers;) but our
traveller warns us not to believe such
things, because they are not true!
No man ever got up the mountain
except one good monk; and he was
miraculously favored, and brought
down with him a plank which is still
preserved in the monastery at the foot
of the mountain. It is inexpressibly
gratifying to observe that Sir John
did not accept all the stories that
were told him, but exercised a little
judicious discrimination; and we shall
therefore pay more respectful attention
to the extraordinary things he tells us
about the diamonds of India. They
are found most commonly, he says,
upon rocks of the sea, or else in connection
with gold. They grow many
together, male and female, and are
nourished by the dew of heaven, so
that they engender and bring forth
small children that multiply and grow
all the year. "I have oftentimes
tried the experiment," he continues,
"that if a man keep them with a
little of the rock, and wet them with
May-dew often, they shall grow every
year, and the small will grow great....
And a man should carry the
diamond on his left side, for it is of
greater virtue than on the right side;
for the strength of their growing is
toward the north, that is the left side
of the world; and the left part of man
is, when he turns his face toward the
east." Sir John was not by any
means singular in his views of the
nature of diamonds in his day, however
much he may be at variance
with modern authorities; and he is
only repeating a popular superstition
of the middle ages when he ascribes
many wonderful virtues to this gem,
which he says preserves the wearer
from poison, and wild beasts, and the
assaults of enemies, and the machinations
of enchanters, gives courage to
the heart and strength to the limbs,
heals lunatics, and casts out devils.
But it loses its virtue by sin.</p>

<p>From stories of eels thirty feet long,
and people of an evil color, green and
yellow, and the well of Perpetual
Youth, from which Sir John avers that
he drank, and rats as great as dogs,
which they take with huge mastiffs,
because the cats feel unable to manage
them, we pass to a passage of a
very different kind, which, considering
the time when it was written, is certainly
curious. One hundred and seventy
years before the time of Columbus
we find Sir John Maundeville arguing
that "the land and sea are of
round shape, because the part of the firmament
appears in one country which
is not seen in another country," and
predicting that "if a man found passages
by ships, he might go by ship
all round the world, above and beneath."
A rather elaborate essay is
devoted to an estimate of the size of
the world, and to the story of an Englishman&mdash;name
unknown&mdash;who sailed
around it once and never knew
it; but coming to a country where
the people spoke his own language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
was so much amazed that he turned
around and sailed all the way back
again. After this, Sir John gets back
without unnecessary delay to the rosy
realms of eastern fable.</p>

<p>We next find him in Java and
among the isles of the Indian Ocean,
where he tells us of rich kings, and
splendid palaces where all the steps
are of gold and silver alternately, and
the walls covered with plates of precious
metals, and halls and chambers
paved with the same; of trees which
bear meal, and honey, and wine, and
deadly poison wherewith the Jews
once tried to poison all Christendom;
of snails so big that many persons may
lodge in their shells; of men who feed
upon serpents, so that they speak
naught, but hiss as serpents do; of
men and women who have dogs'
heads; and of a mountain in the island
of Silha where Adam and Eve
went and cried for one hundred years
after they were driven out of paradise&mdash;cried
so hard that their tears formed
a deep lake, which may be seen there
to this day, if any body doubts the
story. He tells of giants having only
one eye, which is in the middle of the
forehead; people of foul stature and
cursed nature who have no heads,
but their eyes are in their shoulders;
people who have neither noses nor
mouths; people who have mouths so
big that when they sleep in the sun
they cover the whole face with the
upper lip; people who have ears hanging
down to their knees; people who
have horses' feet; and feathered men
who leap from tree to tree. Passing to
India and China, Sir John describes
the fair and fruitful land of Albany,
where there are no poor people, and
the men are of very pale complexion
and have only about fifty hairs in their
beards. He speaks of having personally
visited these regions; but we are
sorry to say that his narrative is palpably
borrowed in many places from
Pliny and Marco Polo. As the great
town called Jamchay he seems to have
found the prototype of Delmonico, and
he gives an impressive account of
the good custom that when a man
will make a feast for his friends he
goes to the host of a certain kind of
inn, and says to him, "Array for me
to-morrow a good dinner for so many
people;" and says also, "Thus much
will I spend, and no more." And Sir
John adds, "Anon the host arrays
for him, so fair, and so well, and so
honestly that there shall lack nothing."
Of the great Chan of Cathay,
(Emperor of China,) and his wealth
and magnificence, Sir John writes at
considerable length, but with an evident
expectation that men will not
believe him. "My fellows and I,"
he says, "with our yeomen, served
this emperor, and were his soldiers
fifteen months against the King of
Mancy, who was at war with him, because
we had great desire to see his
nobleness and the estate of his court,
and all his government, to know if it
were such as we heard say." How
many his fellows were, or what route
they followed in their eastern wanderings,
we cannot tell. Sir John
gives us no particulars; we only learn
that he must have combined in curious
perfection the characters of a pilgrim
and a military adventurer; and
how much of the world he saw, how
much he described from hearsay, we
can only determine from the internal
evidence of his book. There is no
reasonable doubt that he did spend
some time in the dominions of the
great chan; for his description of the
country, the manners of the people,
the magnificence of the sovereign
and the ceremonies of the court,
though exaggerated sometimes to the
heights of the grotesque, if not of the
sublime, keeps near enough to the
probable truth. We cannot say that
we are glad of it; for Sir John is vastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
more entertaining when he does not
know what he is talking about.</p>

<p>He skips about with the most
charming vivacity from Tartary to
Persia, to Asia Minor, and back again
to India, and sometimes it is certain
that he tells us of wonders which he
did not see with his own eyes. In
Georgia, for instance, there is a marvellous
province called Hanyson,
where once upon a time a cursed
Persian king named Saures overtook
a multitude of Christians fleeing from
persecution. The fugitives prayed to
God for deliverance, and lo! a great
cloud arose, covering the king's host
with darkness, out of which they could
not pass, and so the whole province
remains dark to this hour, and no light
shall shine there and no man shall
enter it till the day of judgment.
Voices may sometimes be heard
coming out of the darkness, and the
neighing of horses and crowing of
cocks, and a great river issues from
it bearing tokens of human life.
Somewhat similar to this story is the
account of a region on the borders
of the Caspian Sea, where "the Jews
of ten lineages who are called Gog
and Magog"&mdash;namely, the lost tribes&mdash;have
been shut up for ages behind
impassable mountains. The legend
is that King Alexander drove them
in there, and prevailed upon his gods
to close the mountains with immense
stone gates. In the days of Antichrist
a fox shall burrow through
where Alexander made the gates, and
the imprisoned Jews, who have never
seen a fox, shall hunt him, and following
the burrow break down the gates
and come out into the world. Then
they shall make great slaughter of the
Christians; wherefore Jews all over
the world learn the Hebrew language,
so that in that day the ten tribes may
recognize them by their speech. Somewhere
in this part of the world Sir
John saw and tasted "a kind of fruit
like gourds, which, when they are ripe,
men cut in two, and find within a
little beast, in flesh, bone, and blood,
as though it were a little lamb without
wool." Both the fruit and the
beast are good to eat. Sir John confesses
that this was a great marvel;
but not to be outdone, he told his entertainers
that in England there were
trees bearing a fruit which becomes
flying birds, right good for man's
meat, whereat, he says, his listeners
had also great marvel, and some even
thought the thing impossible. Sir
John, however, was not purposely
cramming the Persians; he only repeated
the popular fable of the barnacle-goose,
which was anciently believed
to be hatched from the barnacles
growing on ships' bottoms and
logs of wood, just as an ordinary
goose is hatched from an egg.</p>

<p>The great mystery and marvel of
the age in which Sir John Maundeville
wrote was the Christian empire
of Prester John, supposed to extend
over central India, and to be in reality
a vast island, separated from other
countries by great branching rivers
which flowed out of Paradise. Many
a traveller went in search of this
mythical and magnificent potentate;
many a doubtful story of his power
and designs was brought back to
Europe; and even a pretended letter
from his majesty to the pope was
widely published in Latin, French,
and other languages. Except the
Chan of Cathay, there was no other
monarch in the world so great and
so rich. The chan, therefore, always
married the daughter of Prester John,
and Prester John always married the
daughter of the chan, which naturally
made confusion in the genealogical
records of the reigning families. Of
course, Sir John Maundeville was too
gallant a traveller to go home without
a full account of the empire of
Prester John. He says he went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
it, and the catalogue of things he saw
and the history of things he did are
wonderful enough to satisfy the most
exacting reader. As it is quite certain
that no potentate ever existed
who bore even a resemblence to the
Prester John of mediÃ¦val legend, it
is more than usually difficult to estimate
the honesty of Sir John in these
particular portions of his narrative,
wherein fable and superstition seem
to reach their climax. The glories of
the Indian court are almost beyond
enumeration. The precious stones
are so large that plates, dishes, and
cups are made of them. There is a
river, rising in paradise, whose waves
are entirely of jewels, without a drop
of water, and it runs only three days
of the week, flowing to the Gravelly
Sea, where it is lost from sight. The
Gravelly Sea has billows of sand without
a drop of water. It ebbs and
flows in great waves, like other seas,
and contains very good fish; but,
adds Sir John, "men cannot pass it
in ships." The emperor lives in unspeakably
gorgeous state, in a palace
of gems and gold, and upon the top
of the highest tower of the palace are
two huge carbuncles which give great
light by night to all people. He is
served by seven kings, seventy-two
dukes, and three hundred and sixty
earls. Every day he entertains at
dinner twelve archbishops and twenty
bishops; and all the archbishops,
bishops, and abbots in the country
are kings. There is a gorgeous artificial
paradise in the dominions of
Prester John, the legend of which
seems to have been used by Tasso
long after Sir John's time in his famous
description of the enchanted gardens
of Armida. In this false Paradise "a
rich man named Gatholonabes, who
was full of tricks and subtle deceits,"
had placed the fairest trees, and fruits,
and flowers, constructed the most
beautiful halls and palaces, all painted
with gold and azure, with youths and
fair damsels attired like angels, birds
which "sung full delectably and
moved by craft," and artificial rivers
of milk, and wine, and honey. When
he had brought good and noble
knights into this place, they were
so captivated by the charming sights
and sounds, so deceived by the fair
speeches of Gatholonabes, and so inflamed
with a certain drink which he
gave them to drink that they became
his willing henchmen, and at his bidding
went out from the mountain
where this garden stood and slew
whomsoever the impostor marked out
for slaughter. To the knights who
lost their lives in his service, he promised
a still fairer Paradise and still
more enticing pleasures. Our readers
will not fail to trace the resemblance
between this fable and the
history of the Old Man of the Mountain,
with whose extraordinary fanatical
sect of Assassins the crusaders
had recently made Europe acquainted.
Sir John's story is probably founded
upon exaggerated accounts of this
famous personage.</p>

<p>To his description of the perilous
Vale of Devils we fear no such respectable
origin can be attributed.
"This vale," he says, "is full of devils,
and has been always;" and horrible
noises are heard in it day and
night, as though Satan and his crew
were holding an infernal feast. Many
daring men have entered in quest of
the gold and silver which are known
to abound therein; but few have come
out again, for the devils strangle the
misbelieving. We regret to say that
Sir John assures us that he actually
saw this vale and went through it
with several of his company. They
heard mass first and confessed their
sins, and, trusting in God, fourteen
men marched into the valley; but
when they came out at the other end
they were only nine. Whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
five were strangled by devils or turned
back, Sir John did not know; he
never saw them again. The vale was
full of horrible sights and sounds.
Corpses covered the ground, storms
filled the air. The face and shoulders
of an appalling devil terrified
them, belching forth smoke and stench
from beneath a huge rock, and several
times the travellers were cast down
to the ground and buffeted by tempests.
Our author unfortunately was
afraid to pick up any of the treasures
which strewed the way; he did not
know what they might really be; for
the devils are very cunning in getting
up imitation gems and metals; and
besides, he adds, "I would not be
put out of my devotion; for I was
more devout then than ever I was
before or after."</p>

<p>When one has passed through the
Vale of Devils, other marvels are encountered
beyond. There are giants
twenty-eight or thirty feet in height,
and Sir John heard of others whose
stature was as much as fifty feet; but
he candidly avows that he "had no
lust to go into those parts," because
when the giants see a ship sailing by
the island on which they live, they wade
out to seize it, and bring the men to
land, two in each hand, eating them all
alive and raw as they walk. In another
island toward the north are people
quite as dangerous, but not quite so
shocking; these are women who have
precious stones in their eyes, and
when they are angry they slay a man
with a look. Still more marvellous
and incredible than any of these tales
is the account of that country, unnamed
and undescribed, where kings
are chosen for their virtue and ability
alone, and justice is done in every
cause to rich and poor alike, and no
evil-doer, be he the king, himself, ever
escapes punishment. There is an isle
besides, called Bragman, or the Land
of Faith, where all men eschew vice,
and care not for money; where there
is neither wrath, envy, lechery, nor
deceit; where no man lies, or steals,
or deceives his neighbor; where never
a murder has been done since the
beginning of time; where there is
no poverty, no drunkenness, no pestilence,
tempest, or sickness, no war,
and no oppression. All these fine
countries are under the sway of the
magnificent Prester John.</p>

<p>Here, on the borders of that Land
of Perpetual Darkness, which stretches
away to the Terrestrial Paradise,
we take leave of our good knight,
now near the end of his travels.
"Rheumatic gouts" began to torture
his wandering limbs and warn him to
go home. He has, indeed, a few more
stories to tell; but they are dull in
comparison with the wonders we have
already recounted. Much more, indeed,
he might have written; but he
gives a truly ingenuous reason for
checking his pen:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And therefore, now that I have devised
you of certain countries which I have spoken
of before, I beseech your worthy and excellent
nobleness that it suffice to you at
this time; for if I told you all that is beyond
the sea, another man perhaps, who would
labor to go into those parts to seek those
countries, might be blamed by my words in
rehearsing many strange things; for he
might not say any thing new, in which the
hearers might have either solace or pleasure."</p></blockquote>

<h2>HOME SCENES IN NEW ENGLAND.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

MY AUNT AND THE CATECHISM.</h3>

<p>"There sister! I told you what
would come of letting that dear child
hear little Mary Ann recite the Romanist
catechism. Here we have
our little Kitty setting herself up as
a judge in matters of religion, and
quoting the answers she has learned
by hearing them repeated! Not but
that she is as good a child as her
auntie or her mother could desire;
but her brain is too thoroughly American,
too much given to going to the
bottom of any subject it is once interested
in, to stop half-way in a matter
of this kind. I knew all the time
how it would end."</p>

<p>Here my maiden aunt paused, more
in sorrow than in anger, and little
Kitty remarked playfully,</p>

<p>"If <em>truth</em> lies at the bottom of a
well, as you once told me, auntie,
how could we ever reach it without
going to the bottom?" While Kitty's
mother replied to her sister in a half-apologizing
manner,</p>

<p>"Why, Laura, I consented to let
her hear Mary Ann's catechism, simply
because Kitty told me that the
poor mother was so much occupied
in striving to earn a living for her little
fatherless ones that she could not
hear it herself; and then the priest
was expected to come here soon, to
prepare the children for confirmation,
which is to be given shortly by the
bishop. So there was no time to lose.
I certainly did not think there could
be any danger in a mere act of kindness."</p>

<p>"Danger!" exclaimed grandmamma,
in defence of her little pet. "If there's
danger in a little knowledge of the
Catholic catechism, it must be because
our house is built on a sandy
foundation, and hence we fear it will
be destroyed by a little outside religious
information. For my part, I
have no objection to full examination
in these matters; nor have I any fear
for the result."</p>

<p>A long-drawn sigh and an ejaculation
of grief from the corner of the
room called our attention to where
grandmamma's sister&mdash;"Aunt Ruby,"
the widow of a Congregational minister&mdash;sat
knitting, removed from the
light of the evening lamps because
of the weakness of her eyes.</p>

<p>"O sister! sister! how can you
talk so. The old adversary goeth
about everywhere like a roaring lion.
He lies hid even in that dish of meal.
If he can only get our folks to questioning
and examining, then the mischief
is done; and we shall have popish
priests coming here, carrying on
their crossings and their blessings, offering
to sell pardons for our sins, and
making us all bow the knee to Baal,
and pray to their graven images. I
shudder to think of it!"</p>

<p>"They do not pray to graven images,
Aunt Ruby; the catechism expressly
forbids it!" replied Kitty.</p>

<p>"There comes that old catechism
again!" exclaimed Aunt Laura. "If
Mary Ann's catechism forbids it, then
the book was trumped up to deceive
American children, and is entirely
different from the catechisms used in
Ireland or France."</p>

<p>"As for that, auntie, Mary Ann's
mother has one she brought from Ireland
many years ago, and it teaches
just the same things. But there is
one thing in both that you will acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
as binding&mdash;'Thou shalt
not bear false witness against thy
neighbor;' and the catechism explains
that it forbids 'all false testimonies,
rash judgments, and lies.' It seems
to me that good people should be
careful not to accuse the Catholic
Church&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Romanist, if you please!"</p>

<p>"Well, the Roman Catholic Church,
of things they do not know to be
true; and I see no harm in inquiring
what is true, and what false, in all
that is brought against it. Here is
our neighbor across the road, a pious
Methodist, will not let her little girl,
who was my best friend, play with
me any more, because I said I thought
lies about Catholics were just as bad
as lies about Methodists. But I shall
always think so, if I lose the friendship
of every body."</p>

<p>A sigh and a groan were heard
from the dark corner, and a voice,
"O poor child! the poison is beginning
to work, and there's no knowing
where it will end. If things are
to go on in this way, it is just as likely
as any thing in the world that we
shall have the Pope of Rome and all
his cardinals down among us before
we know it, letting folks out of purgatory,
selling indulgences to commit
sin, and doing so many other awful
things!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Kitty's father,
who had just come in. "Never mind,
Aunt Ruby, the pope will never take
you, so you need not stand in fear of
him. You are too much in the dark,
and I fear never could bear the light
sufficiently to become one of the children
of holy church."</p>

<p>Kitty's eldest brother, who had
been educated in a Catholic college,
had come in with his father, and now
whispered slyly to grandmamma,</p>

<p>"I don't know about that; I have
great hopes for Aunt Ruby yet. When
she left the Episcopal Church, and
was propounded for admission into
the Congregational, before she married
the minister, you remember how
the old deacons groaned in spirit over
her because they could not get her to
say she was 'willing to be damned.'<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
They insisted that the 'old carnal
heart' was still too strong in her, and
they protested with one voice that it
would never do for their minister to
marry a woman who was not 'willing
to be damned.' Perhaps the dear
old lady remains yet of the same
mind. If so, she may escape, after all."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

WHAT OUR NEIGHBORS THOUGHT OF IT.</h3>

<p>"So you have all heard of this
affair! Then I suppose it must be
true. Well, for my part, I never
could have thought it possible here
in New England, and in the light of
this nineteenth century!" exclaimed
a grave-looking, elderly lady, who sat
in the centre of a group of women
who had met together to spend the
afternoon in chatting and knitting.
"I never could have believed that a
woman so well-informed and so good
as Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; would allow her child
to be ensnared and deceived by these
wicked papists. I was perfectly astonished
when I heard of it."</p>

<p>"And so was I," rejoined another
and younger individual of the group.
"I called to inquire of Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;
herself, to ask if the report was true.
She said it was true; and, what do you
think? she even went so far as to say
that she hoped her Kitty would never
read a worse book than that awful
Romanist catechism! What is to become
of us when good people and
professing Christians talk in this way?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>I am afraid the poor woman is in
great danger herself."</p>

<p>"Of course she is," said another;
"but if she has a craving for error
herself, she has no right to expose
her child to the influence of it. I
am told she openly maintains, and in
Kitty's presence too, that good works
are necessary to salvation, and even
dares to talk about penance and all
those popish abominations. Only the
other day, Kitty told me she thought
lies about Catholics were just as bad
as lies about Methodists. I informed
the young lady that I should have no
more visiting between her and my
daughter. I was sorry to grieve poor
Kitty, she is such a good little girl;
but I could not have the mind of my
child poisoned by such dangerous
doctrines."</p>

<p>A little woman, whose knitting-needles
had been clicking with marvellous
rapidity and energy, and whose countenance
had indicated the most earnest
attention and interest during this
colloquy, here ventured to remark
that she thought Kitty's opinion was
very just, and she would really like
to know what there was so very dangerous
in the Catholic catechism.
She had become acquainted with
many Catholics while visiting her
friends in Canada, and they seemed
to be as good people as there are
anywhere. She wished she could be
informed as to the particular and
alarming errors taught by this
church.</p>

<p>All voices were raised at once in
expressions of surprise at such astounding
ignorance. "Is it possible
there is any one who does not know
that the Roman church is a mass of
errors, corruptions, superstitious mummeries
and idolatries? that Romanists
pray to saints and graven images
instead of praying to God? that the
priests keep the people in darkness
and ignorance in order to domineer
over them at their pleasure. Errors,
to be sure!"</p>

<p>The minute individual whose remarks
had raised this storm of indignation,
here interposed by saying emphatically,
"I confess I do not know
much about this church, except that
in this country it is everywhere denounced
in the strongest terms. But
it is not necessarily as bad as its enemies
represent it to be, any more than
the primitive church was. I do not
dare to condemn any body of Christians&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Christians!" interrupted an old
lady with more acid than honey in
her aspect and manner; "Christians!"
with an unmistakable sneer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Christians!" resumed the
other; "for I am told they believe in
our Lord Jesus Christ; and, as I was
saying, I would not dare to condemn
them without knowing from themselves,
instead of their enemies, what
their doctrines are."</p>

<p>The conversation was here interrupted
by the entrance of Kitty's mother,
who was received with a cold
reserve that revealed to her at once
what the subject of their discussion
had been. Being of a frank and fearless
disposition, and possessing much
of that American candor of soul which
insists on fair play in every contest,
she opened the subject without hesitation,
by saying,</p>

<p>"I have been informed, ladies, that
my neighbors are greatly alarmed because
I allowed my little girl to hear
a Catholic child recite the catechism.
I have examined the little book carefully,
and cannot find any thing in it
to justify such fears. I am not at all
afraid it will hurt my child."</p>

<p>A solemn silence followed this declaration,
when an excited individual
inquired with much vehemence,
"What does it say about priests pardoning
sins, about praying to saints,
and praying souls out of purgatory?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"As to the power of the priests to
pardon sins, it merely repeats the
words of our Lord, 'Whose sins ye
shall forgive, they are forgiven;' and
I confess I never before noticed how
very clear and decisive they were, especially
when he added, 'And lo! I
am with you always, even unto the
end of the world.' As to praying to
saints, it asserts that the saints in glory
pray to God for us, and help us
by their prayers, and that the souls
in purgatory are assisted by our prayers
for them."</p>

<p>"There's no such place as purgatory!"
indignantly exclaimed an old
lady. "I don't believe a word of it."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for you, my dear
friend," replied Kitty's mother, "your
believing or disbelieving does not
make the least difference in this matter.
If there is a purgatory, as was
always held by the Jewish church and
has been by many Protestants, your
opinion will not change the fact or
abolish the institution. I really think
the Catholic doctrine, that the church
triumphant prays for the church militant,
(for what is the true Christian
but a soldier of Christ engaged in a
life-long conflict with the world, the
flesh, and the devil?) and that the
church militant supplicates the mercy
of God on behalf of the church suffering,
is a beautiful and a consoling
one. It is a golden chain that binds
the souls of the redeemed in holy
communion with each other. The
grave that has closed over the precious
form of a dear friend no longer
places an inseparable barrier between
us and the departed soul, but serves
rather to bring us into closer and more
tender sympathy with it. Whether
true or not, I think it is a beautiful
idea."</p>

<p>"And so do I," added the energetic
little knitter; "and I would like
to know more about this doctrine."</p>

<p>The gentleman of the house, an
able lawyer of the place, who had entered
during this conversation, here
declared his intention of procuring
from the priest on his next visit some
books explaining Catholic doctrines.</p>

<p>"For," he remarked, "it certainly
is not just to hear all the accusing
party has to say, and then refuse to
listen to the defence."</p>

<p>Countenances expressive of indignation
and alarm, with sighs and
groans from most of the party, were
the only remonstrances offered to this
bold proposition.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

THE OPINION OF THE SEWING-CIRCLE.</h3>

<p>"I am sure I don't know what will
happen next in our village! What
would have been said thirty years ago
of such outrageous performances?"</p>

<p>These were the words that greeted
my ears as I entered the sewing society
at Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s, on a fine afternoon
in August, 18&mdash;. The speaker,
who was an energetic middle-aged
lady, continued, "First there was the
S&mdash;&mdash; family, with their Romish catechism
and their inquiring into forbidden
things, all going on the broad
road to destruction as rapidly as possible,
with ever so many more fascinated
and entangled in the same
net; and now here Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; and
his whole family have fairly rushed
through the gate and joined those
children of perdition, the Romanists.
It is too bad; too much for human
patience!"</p>

<p>"Nothing more than might be expected
of those Episcopalians!" exclaimed
a prim-looking young lady.
"It is but a step from their church to
Rome. I am not at all surprised."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," remarked
Mrs. J&mdash;&mdash;. "I suspect the Episcopalians
differ just as much from the
Romanists, after all, as the Congregationalists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
or any other Protestant
sect. They are Protestants, you
know, as well as we. You remember
Miss E&mdash;&mdash;, who was the principal
of our female seminary for some
time, a lady of remarkable intelligence
and rare culture, and a very dear
friend of mine in Massachusetts, before
she came here. She was always
a devoted Congregationalist from the
time she first experienced religion;
but she has lately become, I am sorry
to say, a Romanist; and, what is
still worse, she is about to join their
Sisters of Charity! I received from
her, not long ago, a letter explaining
her reasons, and speaking of what she
calls our 'misapprehensions of Catholic
doctrine.' She says she has not
laid aside any part of her former belief;
but has only made such additions
as complete the system, and render
portions which before were dubious,
discordant, and perplexing fragments
the clear, harmonious, distinct, and
necessary members of a perfect whole.
I assure you she has more to say for
herself than you would believe possible,
and she knows how to say it,
too, in a most impressive manner.
She told me, also, of many others of
our persuasion who will probably join
the Catholic Church. So the Episcopalians
are not alone, you see, in this
movement."</p>

<p>"True," said Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;; "for
there is Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; and her daughter,
who were leading Methodists. They
have joined this popish rabble, and
are so very happy in their new home
that it is past belief, and quite amusing
to people of common sense. I
don't believe it makes any difference
what body of Protestant Christians
folks belong to; if they once get to
pondering on these things, they are
almost sure to follow their noses into
the Roman Church before they stop.
When the mind gets fairly waked up,
it does not seem possible to quiet it
in any other way. And then, as you
say, they are all so perfectly contented
and joyous when they have once
entered the 'fold,' as they call it,
that it is a puzzle to sober-minded
Christians! I think this new priest
who has lately come among us is doing
immense mischief already."</p>

<p>"Of course he is!" chimed in another
lady with much asperity. "He
is so very agreeable and polite, so gentle
and easy to get acquainted with,
that every one is attracted by him.
Then he is an American, and knows so
much better how to make himself acceptable
to our people than the other
one did, that he is a great deal more
dangerous on that account. My son
George, who would not speak to
Kitty S&mdash;&mdash;, Jennie H&mdash;&mdash;, and the
W&mdash;&mdash;s, you know, after they began
to patronize Romanism&mdash;though he
thought every thing of them before&mdash;is
already quite at home with this
new priest; takes long walks with
him, and even went to the church
last Sunday, just to see how they get
on over there."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, he told me all about it,"
said Miss Mary B&mdash;&mdash;. He said it
was perfectly astonishing to see Mr.
W&mdash;&mdash; singing and chanting with
those shabby Canadians; and there
were the W&mdash;&mdash;s, the H&mdash;&mdash;s, and
the S&mdash;&mdash;s, kneeling right in the
midst of that rabble, and to all appearance
as intent on their prayers,
and as much absorbed in what was
going on, as any one present. They
seemed quite at home, and to understand
every thing as well as if they
had been accustomed to it all their
lifetime. George said he placed himself
where they couldn't help seeing
him; but they were not disconcerted
in the least. Even the girls never
seemed to notice him at all. He
said they doubtless understood the
service, but he didn't. I think, Mrs.
G&mdash;&mdash;, that it will not be very safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
for George to go there often; for he
told me that there was a wonderful
solemnity and fascination about the
place&mdash;which is not much better than
a mere shanty&mdash;and about the service,
though he didn't understand a word
of it. He never felt so solemn in all
his life, he said; and that was a great
deal for such a scatterbrain as George
to say."</p>

<p>"I have heard others older and
wiser than he say the same," remarked
a thoughtful-looking widow with a
sigh. "My brother, who is a deacon,
and a man of very cool temperament
and calm judgment, says he never
was in a Catholic place of worship
but once, and then he was almost
frightened at the sensation of awe
that came over him. He said it
seemed to him that the impression it
made was what one would naturally
expect if their doctrine of the real
presence were true, and the sight of
the solemn assurance which a great
many apparently devout and good
people evidently possessed of their
near approach to their Redeemer,
really present in that place, affected
him so sensibly that he could not
shake the feeling off. It was a very
plain little chapel, by no means equal
to our churches; but he said it seemed
as if something whispered to him
that he was standing on holy ground.
He has been very painfully exercised
about these matters ever since, and
he says that the sixth chapter of St.
John's Gospel, which never troubled
him before, now appears to be all in
favor of their doctrine."</p>

<p>"For my part, I don't see why
Protestants want to go near them at
all!" exclaimed another indignantly.
"It only brings about mischief; and
the only way to put down such things
is to set our faces resolutely against
every one that countenances any
thing pertaining to Romanism. We
must be determined that we will have
nothing to do with such people in any
way. We must keep entirely aloof
from Romanists and from Romanizers."</p>

<p>"Well, I confess that I am very
much puzzled about all these matters,"
quietly observed a lady of very
gentle manners, in a low voice. "I
cannot help having misgivings that a
system which carries into its minutest
circumstances and details such almost
irresistible power may perhaps, after
all, owe it to the force of truth. It is
certainly sustained and animated by
some principle not possessed or exerted
by Protestantism in any of its
branches."</p>

<p>"It is a principle of evil, then,"
cried the former austere speaker.
"The Prince of Darkness knows how
to appear as an 'angel of light'!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" resumed the other; "but
you know our Lord said, 'If they
have called the Master of the house
Beelzebub, how much more those
of his household!' We ought to be
careful how we bring such accusations
against a church which certainly
numbers some very good people
among its members. One thing
may be said of it, that the poor are
tenderly cherished and cared for within
its pale; and I can never believe
that the evil one is the dispenser or
instigator of so many charities as
are instituted and supported by this
church."</p>

<p>"All done for effect, and to lead
poor Protestants astray! Take care,
my dear friend; for these misgivings
are the beginning of danger, and if
you follow them, they will surely lead
you into the Romish Church. That
is the way all those who have lost the
light of Protestantism have been ensnared."</p>

<p>"If it should prove that they gave
up an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> for the light of the
star that guided the wise men of old
to the crib of the Infant Redeemer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
did they not do well rather than ill?"
suggested the quiet speaker, and was
answered only by a murmur of indignation
at her bold conjecture, as the
party withdrew to another room where
the tea-table was spread for their refreshment.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE DONATION-PARTY.</h3>

<p>"Did you go to the donation party
at our minister's last night, sister
C&mdash;&mdash;? I was so sorry that I couldn't
go! My little girl had such a bad
cold, I did not dare to leave her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was there; and, don't you
think! Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; was there too,
with her daughter. Would you have
believed she would dare to show her
face among the Methodists, after what
has happened?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I should not! But
wonders will never cease. How did
she appear?"</p>

<p>"As pleasant and gentle as ever;
and just as much at home as if she
had never left us to join the Catholics.
Sister J&mdash;&mdash; would not speak
to her at first, or look at her; and
our good old brother L&mdash;&mdash;, who
used to be her class-leader, you know,
quite turned the cold shoulder upon
her; but she was not to be put off
so easily; and after a little while, her
kind and winning ways had thawed
all the ice, and we couldn't help being
pleasant with her."</p>

<p>"Well, I always did love sister
H&mdash;&mdash;; hence I don't want to meet
her now. I am glad I was not there!
Did any one speak to her about her
change?"</p>

<p>"Yes; brother L&mdash;&mdash; could not
help telling her how sorry we were to
lose her; and she said, 'You have
not lost me, brother L&mdash;&mdash;; I shall
never forget my dear Methodist friends,
and shall never cease to love and
pray for them!' 'Pray for them!'
brother L&mdash;&mdash; said with great contempt;
'we don't thank people for
praying to the saints for us; we can
pray to God for ourselves. Ah Sister
H&mdash;&mdash;! if you would only pray
to him as you used to, when you
were a warm-hearted Methodist, that
would do!' Her answer to this was
what puzzled me. I remember every
word of it, she looked so grieved,
and so sweetly earnest, while the tears
fairly came to her eyes as she said,
'Pray to God as I used to, Brother
L&mdash;&mdash;! Why, I never knew the
meaning of the word prayer until I
was a Catholic! I then entered the
very atmosphere of prayer! My life,
my breath, my every thought, my every
action, became one continual prayer
to an ever-present God from that hour.
The saints united with me, assisted
me&mdash;at my request prayed for me&mdash;and
for those for whom I desired
their prayers in union with my own;
and of that perfect union and communion
with them, I can give you
no idea. O brother L&mdash;&mdash;! believe
me, there is no home for a 'warm-hearted
Methodist' but the Catholic
Church! Don't you remember, in
our class conferences, how I used to
say I was happy, but not satisfied; I
felt that I was still a seeker. I had
been first a Congregationalist, then
an Episcopalian, and at last a Methodist;
but had not found all I was
seeking for. You thought I never
would until I reached heaven; but'&mdash;and
how I wish, dear friend, you
could have seen and heard her as she
said it, for I cannot describe her impressive
manner&mdash;'but brother, I have
found it all in the Catholic Church!
The blank is filled. The yearning of
my soul is satisfied so entirely that
there is nothing left to desire!'</p>

<p>"'All a delusion, sister H&mdash;&mdash;!'
exclaimed brother L&mdash;&mdash;. 'You'll
wake up some time and find it so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and then you'll come back!' She
looked perfectly dismayed at the very
thought, as she replied, 'Come back
to what? To content myself with the
shadow, when I have possessed the
substance? to satisfy my hunger with
the husks of the stranger, when I
have feasted at the continual and
overflowing banquet of my Father's
table! O my Methodist friends! if
you could but taste for once the
sweetness and fulness of that banquet,
you would never cast one backward
look upon what you had left,
except to mourn for those who remain
contented there, when they might be
feasting on the bread of angels!' I
confess to you, Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;, that I
could not help being moved by her
earnestness to wish that I was even
as she is! No one can doubt her
entire sincerity who listens to her.
Brother L&mdash;&mdash; asked her if it could
be possible that she believed all the
absurdities taught by the Romish
Church? She replied that she believed
no absurdities, and that he had
not the slightest idea as to what the
Catholic Church really did teach; a
tissue of absurdities had been invented
by its enemies, and palmed off
upon the too credulous Protestants as
its teachings, when they were entirely
foreign to it, and baseless misrepresentations.
'But,' she added, 'I believe
all that my church really does
offer to my belief, as firmly as I believe
that there is a sun in the firmament
of heaven!'"</p>

<p>"Well, how strange it all is, to be
sure! Now, I met Mrs. L&mdash;&mdash; the
other day, and I was so provoked at
the way they are going on, that I
could not for my life help asking her
why, in the name of common sense,
if they wanted to be Romanists, they
didn't all go together like sensible
people, and not string along, one to-day,
another to-morrow, and so on, as
they do? And what do you think
was her reply? 'Why, you know, Mrs.
M&mdash;&mdash;,' she said; 'that we read of the
olden time that, "The Lord added
<em>daily</em> unto the church of such as should
be saved"!' There is one thing, as
you say, that cannot be doubted or
denied: right or wrong, they are solemnly
in earnest, and heartily sincere.
You know little Kitty S&mdash;&mdash;
had a terrible fit of sickness before
they became Catholics, (some think
her sickness hastened that event,) and
has been a great sufferer ever since.
Sister W&mdash;&mdash; has taken care of her
through it all, and I should not wonder
if she should go off on the same
road. She is all taken up with it now,
and justifies their course; says all the
evils we have been accustomed to
hear of the Catholic religion are slanders,
and that if the S&mdash;&mdash;s, and especially
little Kitty, are not Christians
of the true stamp, she does not rightly
understand the gospel of Christ."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

REMINISCENCES OF THE PAST.</h3>

<p>After an absence of over twenty
years, we returned to the pleasant village
in New England which had formerly
exercised over us the charm
that pertains to the magic name of
<span class="smcap">HOME</span>.</p>

<p>Seeking out one of the few old
neighbors who were left, on the morning
after our arrival, I was met with
the surprised and joyful exclamation,</p>

<p>"Why, my dear Mrs. J&mdash;&mdash;! can
it be possible that this is your own
self? I had no hopes of ever seeing
you again in this world."</p>

<p>"It is indeed myself," I replied.
"We have long been wanderers by
'field and flood;' but have at length
returned to remain a short time among
the scenes of other years. If you are
at leisure, I want to settle down into
my own cosy corner of the dear old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sitting-room, just as if I had never
been away, and ask you as many
questions about village affairs and
those of the olden time as you will
want to answer."</p>

<p>"You could not furnish me with a
greater pleasure, I assure you! But
O my friend! what changes have
taken place since you left! Very
few of those who were with us then
still remain. Many have died, some
have gone 'West,' and some have
found their way to San Francisco
and other parts of California."</p>

<p>"Where are the W&mdash;&mdash;s?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"They removed to another place
some years ago, and their family is
widely scattered; but they remain
united in spirit, and steadfast in the
faith."</p>

<p>"And the S&mdash;&mdash;s?"</p>

<p>"Only three of them are living.
One has gone to the far West, and
the others have left this place. Little
Kitty, after years of patient suffering,
during which she never ceased
to thank God for having permitted
her to find in the holy Catholic
Church 'the path over which so many
saints and martyrs have passed to
heaven'&mdash;as she expressed it&mdash;at
length meekly and joyfully resigned
her youthful spirit to her Maker; leaving
the light of a beautiful example
to shine around the lonely home, and
console the bereaved family. Her
grandmother, who embraced the faith
soon after her granddaughter made
profession of it, followed her to the
other world in a few months, consoled
by all the rites of the church, in
which, though she entered its blessed
inclosure late in life, she had in a
'short space,' by her good words and
works, acquired the merit of many
years. Then 'Aunt Laura' and Kitty's
younger sister joined them, 'rejoicing
in hope.' 'Aunt Ruby' survived
them some years, and was often
heard to wish, with a sigh, that
she could be sure she was as well prepared
to leave the world as her Catholic
sister; but she never had the
courage to brave the ill-opinion of
her own little world of Congregationalism&mdash;over
the modern innovations
and delinquencies of which she
never ceased to mourn&mdash;by following
that sister into the only 'ark of
safety.'"</p>

<p>"Ah!" I exclaimed; "how many
changes indeed. Then I shall never
see those dear friends whom I had so
fondly hoped to meet again. And
where is Mrs. L&mdash;&mdash;, our energetic little
knitter, who was so true to every
impulse of divine grace and truth?"</p>

<p>"She has long slept in the village
cemetery. 'Faithful unto death!'
might well have been the inscription
upon her grave. She passed through
severe and bitter trials, and was made
to feel that there are tortures as cruel
as those of the rack or wheel, to a
sensitive spirit, in the cold contempt
and neglect of those who should have
been her protectors, as they were her
only earthly support. But she never
wavered for a moment in her firm
trust, or ceased to rejoice that she
had been called to the profession of
the true faith, which abundantly sustained
her under all her griefs and
sufferings."</p>

<p>"And dear, gentle Mrs. N&mdash;&mdash;? I
felt sure she would forsake the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis
fatuus</i> of Protestantism at last for
'the light of the star that guided the
wise men' of old, though she was so
long in making up her mind."</p>

<p>"She did so; and died rejoicing in
its light, by the crib of Bethlehem!"</p>

<p>"Do Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; and her daughter
still live?"</p>

<p>"The daughter died some years
ago, and was laid near little Kitty
S&mdash;&mdash;, whom she tenderly loved, and
regarded as the chief instrument of
her conversion. Her mother has removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to some distance; but is as
fervently thankful to-day for the great
gift of faith as she was on that memorable
one when she first accepted
it, and turned from old and dear associations
to find the 'only home for
the warm-hearted Methodist,' in the
bosom of the Catholic Church."</p>

<p>"I heard, soon after I left, that the
G&mdash;&mdash;s became Catholics. Was it
true?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and very faithful and fervent
children of the church they
were; illustrating the beauty of Catholic
truths by the shining virtues of
their lives. But, alas! of the whole
family&mdash;father, mother, and five children&mdash;but
one survives. They departed
followed by the prayers and
benedictions of the whole Catholic
congregation, to whose service they
had devoted their best efforts."</p>

<p>"Then there were the B&mdash;&mdash;s, the
K&mdash;&mdash;s, and the C&mdash;&mdash;s, who were
deeply interested in Catholic truths
when I left. Did they follow out their
convictions?"</p>

<p>"No; they were 'almost persuaded'
to cast in their lot with the happy
band of converts; but the storm
of obloquy and reproach which soon
gathered around the devoted company&mdash;without
in the least disturbing
their peace&mdash;so appalled those outside,
that they did not dare to follow
the inspiration, or ever again to seek its
aid. Some became Spiritualists, some
Second Adventists, and those who remain
nominally as they were before,
have fallen into hopeless indifference
to all religion, and intense worldliness;
seeking in petty ambitions and trifling
pursuits the comfort they are
no longer able to find in the bosom
of any sect. The glimmering of Catholic
light which they accepted had
served only to reveal to them the utter
emptiness of Protestantism, when
they steadfastly closed their eyes to
any further illumination. While life
remains there is hope; but such cases
as these seem as nearly hopeless as
any in this world can be."</p>

<p>We visited the cemetery, where reposed
the mortal remains of so many
friends who had been the theme of
our conversation; and I found familiar
names more numerous there than
were familiar faces among the living.
We also sought together the spacious
church which had been erected during
my absence, and which is a beautiful
and enduring evidence of the
active zeal of a congregation which
is richer in holy memories, and in
faith, hope, and charity, than in the
goods of this world.</p>

<h2>IRELAND'S MISSION.</h2>

<p class="center">BY W. MAZIERE BRADY, D.D., AN IRISH PROTESTANT CLERGYMAN.</p>


<p>Few persons expected that the
passing of Mr. Gladstone's disestablishment
bill would have immediately
introduced a golden age into Ireland.
The leading promoters of that
measure never regarded it as one
which was final and complete; but
rather as a necessary prelude to certain
reconstructive measures more
powerful and important than itself.
The abolition of the ascendency of
an alien church did not restore&mdash;and
did not affect to restore&mdash;to the Catholic
Church its ancient status and endowments.
The attempt would be
entirely vain to regather the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disjecta
membra</i> of the great body of Irish
church temporalities long since dispersed
and broken up by successive
spoliations and alienations. The property
dealt with by the recent legislation
is but a small fraction of what
once belonged to the Irish Church.
Restitution, unhappily, is often impossible
to the statesman. He may
build up an edifice upon ruins, and
create new empires out of revolutions.
But he can no more give back to outraged
nationalities their unsullied honor,
or to plundered kingdoms their
squandered treasures, than he can restore
to those fallen from purity their
virgin crown or reÃ«ndow criminals
with a conscience void of offence and
free from sear of guilt. And therefore
the removal of the alien church
led to no replacement of the old
Catholic Church in the position vacated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
by its Protestant rival; but merely
paved the way for the introduction of
constructive measures upon the nature
of which will depend the future, not
of Ireland merely, but of the British
empire. Amidst these constructive
measures the statesman will not reckon
any provisions for the maintenance
or aggrandisement of the Catholic
Church in Ireland. A church which
withstood calamity and survived the
loss of its possessions, and flourished
under three hundred years of bitter
persecution, may safely be left to itself.
State patronage, in any extended
form, might corrupt, but could not
strengthen, Irish Catholicism. Catholics
in many countries are beginning
to feel that freedom of action and
development is of far greater value
than endowments to the church. In
Ireland, Catholics have long since perceived
and acknowledged that liberty&mdash;not
the enervating influence of
court favor&mdash;is the true bulwark of
Catholic worship.</p>

<p>Legislators have, in fact, no occasion
to take into their consideration the
Irish Catholic Church, except in so
far as its power and interests intermingle
with the educational and other
social and political problems which
demand deep and impartial inquiry.
Whoever examines, without prejudice
or passion, the actual position of Ireland
as an integral part of the British
empire must confess that Ireland
forms at this time, more than at any
other, the cardinal point of English
policy. Gibraltar was once the key
to the Mediterranean and to political
supremacy in Europe. Ireland is to
England another Gibraltar, on whose
rock British power must be either consolidated
or riven. The Ireland of
1870 is rapidly entering on a new
phase of existence, which is none the
less worthy of the statesman's study
because it is the result of causes altogether
beyond his control. Ireland
is no longer an island lying within
a few hours' sail of the English navy,
inhabited by men whose interests may
be disposed of without reference to
the wishes of any save the inhabitants
of Great Britain. The people of Ireland
are by no means confined within
the territorial limits of that country.
The Irish nation has two homes.
The one is in Ireland, the other is in
America. Misgovernment sent half
Ireland into exile, and those exiles
have prospered and multiplied to
an extent far exceeding any known
examples of similar transmigrations.
But although there are two homes,
there is but one nation of Irishmen.
Five millions of men occupy Irish
soil, but far more than twice five
millions of Irishmen dwelling in foreign
lands not only claim but exercise
an ever-increasing influence on Irish
politics. Some few among the ultra-conservative
statesmen of England&mdash;and
among them one no less distinguished
than the great chief of the
late Tory administration&mdash;looked with
eyes of cruel satisfaction on the exodus
which wiser men regarded with
awe as a hemorrhage draining away
the life-blood of their kingdom. The
famine was to these bigoted men a
God-gift, which swept off what they
flippantly termed a superabundant
population. Emigration was, in their
eyes, a more tedious and costly process
for the decimation of Irish Catholics.
Protestants, belonging chiefly to
the dominant and richer class, were in
proportion to their numbers less exposed
than Catholics to the severity
of the famine and the necessity of
expatriation. Famine and emigration,
if only Providence would prolong and
intensify their action, would alter&mdash;so
they thought&mdash;the numerical proportions
between Catholics and Protestants
make Ireland a Protestant country
and render the church establishment
less anomalous. Let a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
more years pass&mdash;so argued these
reasoners&mdash;and instead of having to
legislate for a Catholic, discontented,
Ireland, over-populated and half-pauperized,
we shall have to deal with
one comparatively Protestant, which
will be prosperous, happy, and loyal
to the British crown. It is recorded
of an English statesman that he once
expressed a wish&mdash;in jest, no doubt&mdash;that
Ireland were for an hour submerged
in the Atlantic, that it might
rise again stripped of its inhabitants, a
fresh field for the importation of English
Protestant colonists. The folly
of wishing for either a flood or a famine
to repair the defects of English
legislation for Ireland, is now as apparent
as the cruelty. Even though
the island of Ireland were reduced
to such a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula rasa</i> as some bigots
would desire, England must take into
account the thousands and millions
of Irishmen in various lands who constitute
part of the Irish nation, and
who think, plan, and pray for the
happiness of their traditional fatherland.
And fortunately for the interests
of England, no less than of Ireland,
a policy has of late been adopted
by the leaders of the great liberal
party which professes to deal with
Catholic Ireland, not as with a venomous
thing to be guarded against,
kept down, and, if possible, crushed,
but as a country to be tenderly regarded,
carefully cherished, and legislated
for with a view to the contentment
and preservation of its Catholic
people. The policy of Mr. Gladstone,
Mr. Bright, and the party of which
they are now the recognized chiefs,
is at present but partially developed,
yet has already produced good fruits.
Righteousness exalteth a nation, and
England has risen immensely in the
opinion of wise and good men in
Europe and America by that great
though tardy&mdash;the greater, perhaps,
because so tardy&mdash;act of righteousness,
namely, the abolition of an English
Protestant church establishment
for Irish Catholics. The sympathies
of all honest men in every quarter of
the globe are with the English government
in its endeavor to stay the tide
of Irish emigration, and retain Irishmen
upon their native soil as contented
occupiers and owners of farms.
But admiration and sympathy are not
the only rewards which England may
reap by steadily following out the
policy begun by Mr. Gladstone. The
integrity of the British empire may be
shown to depend upon the continued
development of the principles which
carried the Irish church bill of 1869
and introduced an Irish land bill in
1870. If it be too presumptuous to
attempt to forecast a triumphant progress
for those principles, it will yet
be not wholly profitless to denote the
perils and obstructions which beset
the way.</p>

<p>The disturbances and outrages
which in Ireland preceded and followed
the passing of the disestablishment
bill, were the natural result of
the violent harangues uttered by the
fanatic debaters of the Church Defence
Association, many of whom announced
to their excited auditors that the
land bill of Mr. Gladstone would confiscate
the property of Protestant land-owners
in Ireland. The evil passions
of men thus deceived into a belief
that a wrong was intended not only
to their church but to their lands,
found vent not merely in hard words
and cruel threats, but in merciless
deeds. Some Protestant landlords
withheld the accustomed local charitable
contributions which, as owners
of property, they had hitherto given
to various institutions. Others issued
notices of ejection against their tenants,
and these attempted ejections
produced&mdash;as capricious injustice is
certain to do&mdash;ill-will and resistance.
Outrages, even assassinations, occurred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
But such offences against public
order may be expected to cease
when the causes of them are removed.
Time will allay the heat of bygone
party conflicts. Agrarian outrages
will, if the land bill be good for
any thing, occur as rarely in Ireland
as in America. Industrious laborers
will, it is to be hoped, find it easy to
rent or purchase small holdings on
which they may expend their toil, and
in which they may invest their savings
without fear of their being appropriated
to the use of felonious landlords
by means of notices to quit. It
is when the excitement of the land
and church questions shall have yielded
to the pressure of other momentous
questions, that the real danger
will threaten the onward march of
those principles which, in the opinion
of many, can alone safely guide the
mutual relations between England
and Ireland. The education question
will be a highly perilous one.
If the liberal party put forward a
scheme for compulsory, or secular, or
sectarian education, which shall, on
whatever pretext, either nominally or
practically, tend to withdraw the education
of Catholic children from the
immediate control of the priests, the
result will be disappointment and disaster.
Free education, in the sense
of an education independent of religion,
has great charms in the eyes
of English and Irish liberals. Some
Catholics are inclined to favor any
scheme which would place a superior
system of secular instruction within
the reach of the great bulk of the
poorer and middle class, even though
it should not provide for that religious
training which is a characteristic of a
strictly Catholic education. But the
Catholic clergy of Ireland, to a man,
and those members of Parliament who
represent Irish Catholic constituencies,
will give strenuous and effectual
opposition to undenominational or secular
education under its open guise,
although they may prove unable to
resist the employment, in a modified
shape, of the principle which they regard
as pernicious. It will be much
to the advantage of Great Britain if
the education of Catholics in England,
as well as in Ireland, be made thoroughly
Catholic. The vast, and in
many respects admirable system of
national education in Ireland, which,
twenty or thirty years ago, was favorably
regarded by very many of the
Irish Catholic bishops and clergy,
has long since been declared unsatisfactory
by the Catholic hierarchy.
The elementary national schools are
now merely tolerated. The national
model schools are loudly denounced.
The national system aimed at giving
to all children a combined secular instruction
and at affording opportunities
for separate religious instruction.
The priest and the parson were invited
to become joint patrons of schools.
The board of education were to supply
school-rooms, teachers, books, and
requisites for a secular instruction in
which all the pupils were to share.
The ministers of various denominations
were to supply, either personally
or by deputy, a religious teaching
to their respective pupils. Thus an
hour or more was to be set apart for
religious teaching. During that hour
the Catholic children were to be
taught the Catholic religion by the
priest, or by one of the masters under
the priest's direction, and the Protestant
children were similarly to be
taught the principles of Protestantism
in another room by the parson, or by
one of the teachers under his control.
It was supposed that all ministers of
religion would join in carrying out a
system which thus provided for the
general education of the poor, without
interfering with the conscientious discharge
of that part of the ministerial
duty of clergymen which relates to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the religious teaching of the young.
The idea of instructing Catholic and
Protestant children together and bringing
them up in habits of mutual affection
and esteem, was specious and captivating.
Who could withhold his
quota of aid toward realizing the
prospect thus held out of future generations
of educated Irishmen of various
creeds, each respecting the religious
principles of the others while
strong in his own, and all loyal to the
impartial government of the British
crown? Yet, at its very outset, the
clergy and bishops of the Protestant
establishment held aloof from the national
board. They refused any partnership
with Catholic priests in the
management of schools, and declared
that their consciences would not permit
them to consent to support a system
which set limits to the free use
of the holy Scriptures during secular
instruction. In vain was it shown
that in Protestant universities, colleges,
and higher schools, nay, that
in the very order for divine service
according to the ritual of the establishment,
a limit was actually set to
the use of the holy Scriptures by the
appointment of fixed times and places
for the study and reading and exposition
of the sacred word. In vain
was it demonstrated that neither insult
nor disparagement was intended
by regulations which might be looked
on as scarcely different from those
which prevented a lecturer in mathematics
from giving his class a dissertation
upon Isaiah, and denied a clergyman
of the establishment the privilege
of interpolating his reading of
the litany with a chapter from the
Apocalypse. The establishment clergy,
with a few notable exceptions, asserted
it as their right and duty to
use the Scriptures at all times in their
schools, and declared it to be a sin to
consent to suspend, even during the
hours of combined secular instruction,
their office of teachers of divine truth.
By adopting this course they lost
whatever claim to public estimation
they might otherwise have had as
helpers of education, and hastened,
undoubtedly, the fall of their establishment.
It has lately, through the
publication of Archbishop Whately's
biography by his daughter and of the
journals of Mr. Senior, been fully
disclosed that a desire for proselytism,
although in his lifetime he publicly
professed the contrary, was at the
bottom of that able prelate's energetic
support of the national system. The
religious and moral teaching of the
books used for combined secular instruction
had, so argued Whately in
private, a strong tendency to implant
truths which must lead to the reception
of Protestantism. Give free
scope, so reasoned the archbishop,
to the national system, and, although
the priests may not perceive their danger,
Ireland must cease to be a Catholic
country. When publicly advocating
the national system, Whately's
language was, of course, far different.
Then he maintained stoutly that the
books were thoroughly impartial, he
repudiated with affected loathing any
dishonorable desire to make converts
to Protestantism, and he professed
the most scrupulous respect for the
consciences of those who differed
from him in religion. The posthumous
publication of Whately's real
sentiments&mdash;destructive as that publication
is of much of his reputation,
and especially of his character for
straightforwardness&mdash;forms a valuable
vindication, not merely of the behaviour
of those more honest commissioners
of education whose refusal to
adopt the Whately tactics led to
Whately's retirement from the board,
but also of the conduct of the Catholic
bishops and clergy who have
found it necessary emphatically to
demand a radical change in the system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of national instruction so far as
Catholics are concerned.</p>

<p>It is, however, for the interests of
Protestantism and of Great Britain, as
well as of Catholicism, that the education
of Catholics should be carried
on more perfectly in accord with the
desires of the Catholic people. The
principle of religious neutrality in education
has been tried in Ireland, and
found wanting. It has not resulted in
bringing into the same school-rooms
the young of various creeds, and educating
them in mutual love. Three
or four Protestants may be found in
the same school with a hundred Catholics;
or three or four Catholics
may attend a school frequented by a
hundred Protestants. But nowhere
in Ireland is it possible to find a
school where one half of the pupils
are Protestants and the other half
Catholics, or where the Protestant
clergyman and the Catholic priest, as
joint patrons, superintend their respective
classes. It is true, indeed,
that proselytism is discouraged by
the rules of the board, and that no
favor is shown to one denomination
more than to another. But with all
this endeavor after impartiality by its
administrators, the system inflicts a
serious wound upon Catholicity. The
authority of the board is substituted
for that of the Catholic Church. The
national school teacher, when in training
for his office, learns his duties
from men of various religious denominations,
who are not permitted,
even were they desirous, to impart a
devotional color to what they teach.
The virtues must be commended on
moral, not on religious grounds. Patriotism
may take root in ignorance;
for no book of Irish history is to be
found in the list of Irish national
school books. When the trained
teacher is set over a school, he still
regards himself as dependent upon
the board which is his paymaster.
Catholic teachers may, and sometimes
do, hold opinions different from those
of the priest, and even upon occasions
refuse to carry out the priest's
directions in the matter of religious
teaching. The influence of the priest
upon his flock is weakened by that
very separation between secular and
religious instruction which is the basis
of the system of national education.
Protestantism may flourish under
the impartiality, neutrality, and
secularization of education at which
the originators of that system aimed;
but Catholicism must inevitably become
deteriorated.</p>

<p>It was in past years the almost universal
belief of Protestant governments,
that an Irish Catholic, in proportion
as he ceased to be loyal to
his spiritual, would advance in loyalty
toward his temporal sovereign. Toleration
was offered, even under Elizabeth
and James, to Catholics who
would abjure the spiritual supremacy
of the pope. In modern times the
same spirit of distrust shows itself in
the endeavor, on the part of some
Protestant statesmen, to offer to Catholics
educational and other advantages
upon conditions inconsistent
with Catholic practices. Those greatly
err who thus fancy that Great Britain
will gain&mdash;either politically or religiously&mdash;by
the undermining of the
influence of the Catholic priesthood,
or by leavening the education of Catholics
with the spirit of secularization.
The Irish Catholic may be
taught to unlearn his faith, to neglect
confession, and disobey the injunctions
of his priest; but no one will
say that thereby he becomes, necessarily,
either a better Christian or a
better subject to his sovereign. Such
a one may, or may not, become a
Protestant or an infidel. When the
influence of the priest is weakened
or destroyed, the Irish Catholic becomes
an easy victim to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
teach disloyalty and rebellion. But
his lapse into treason should be ascribed
to the fact not of his being a
Catholic, but of his being a bad one.
No good Catholic who values the sacraments,
and respects the precepts
of his church, could possibly join the
treasonable brotherhoods denounced
by the Catholic priest from the altar,
by the bishops in pastorals, and by
the pope himself. There are, however,
too many Irish Catholics whose
obedience to their church is partial,
or but nominal. Perhaps these men
first learnt in Irish national schools
the lesson that religion, like every
thing else, has its appointed time and
place; that Catholic devotion forms
no indispensable portion of secular
studies, and that priestly intervention
in affairs not strictly religious is
intrusive and impertinent. The want
of a truly Catholic training in early
life doubtless has led many an adult
Catholic to hold that a priest out-steps
the proper sphere of his office,
when he cautions his flock against
revolutionary excesses.</p>

<p>If misdirected and uncatholic
teaching occasions many Irish Catholics
to become rebels in thought if
not in deed, their education has advanced
and is advancing in another
point, so as to render their treason
more dangerous. Irishmen in former
years were prompt to seize occasions
for the overthrow of British rule, but
lacked certain qualities requisite for
permanent success. They seemed incapable,
for any length of time, of
combined action and resolution in the
field or the cabinet. They carried
into battle the dissensions and jealousies
of their divided council-chambers.
Brilliant displays of military valor
served only to mark more distinctly
the fatal effects of indecision and insubordination.
Victory itself was often
the prelude to that demoralization
of forces which is the worst consequence
of defeat. But now the
Irish are swiftly learning to acquire
those qualities of organization and
self-government which will render their
revolts more formidable and disastrous
to England than hitherto they have
proved. Irishmen have shown themselves
in American campaigns not
soldiers merely, but generals, and not
merely skilful tacticians in handling
masses of troops before the enemy,
but also able organizers, clever in
moulding and disciplining untrained
materials into effective battalions. Habits
of promptitude, self-control, and
self-reliance belong to the Irish-American
in perhaps even a higher degree
than to the Anglo-Saxon. The number
is rapidly increasing of Irishmen
who, having acquired those habits in
America, repair to Ireland and communicate
them in some degree to
their brethren at home. The peasantry
of Ireland&mdash;already familiarized
with trans-Atlantic ideas of independence
and republicanism&mdash;are apt
to become Americanized. Their sympathies
are with the United States
rather than with England. If war
broke out between Great Britain and
the States, no one doubts but that
the first American army flung upon
Irish shores would find Ireland one
vast recruiting field, and that swarms
of soldiers of Irish descent would fly
from distant lands to Ireland to lend
their aid in rendering it, throughout
its length and breadth, a garrison impregnable
to British attacks. And
no one doubts but that England&mdash;even
though eventually victorious by
land and sea&mdash;would depart from
such a conflict crippled in half her
strength. Ireland, alienated irrevocably,
would be to England like a
paralyzed limb to the combatant, both
a sign and a source of weakness. At
no very distant period from the termination
of such a war, Ireland would
virtually become an American outpost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and would cease to be an integral
part of Great Britain. Without
Ireland to rely upon, England could
scarcely be expected to maintain a
position as a first-class power in the
event of war among European nations.
Mercenary troops might, indeed,
for a time supply the want of
Irish soldiers and sailors. But the
nation which has to hire foreign
troops to fight its battles is already
in decay.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that Ireland,
instead of becoming the occasion
of ruin and dismemberment to the
British empire, may prove its mainstay
and the bond of its integrity.
If Ireland shall become prosperous
and contented under the changed policy
of England, if its population shall
increase under prosperity, and if its
nationality shall be recognized and
fostered&mdash;then no combination of European
foes, unaided by America, can
hope to prevail against the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
But why should America withhold her
hand, when opportunity shall have
presented itself for dealing a blow
in repayment of old wrongs aggravated
by recent disputes? France
may demand the armed assistance of
the States, whose existence as an independent
government she so powerfully
helped to create. He reads ill
the face of nations who fails to perceive
that the great body of Americans
desire to see the pride of England
humbled, and that they are treasuring
up their wrath against the day
of wrath. The native-born Americans
are moved by the transmitted
rancor of past injustice. Those of
Irish and Catholic descent have the
wrongs of Ireland and of the Catholic
Church to avenge. All the traditions
of faith and patriotism are now arrayed
against England, and the influence
of the Irish and Catholic population
of the States is sufficient to decide the
political action of Congress in the
eventuality of the reasonableness of
war with Great Britain becoming a
subject for discussion. Yet the Irish
and Catholic element in the American
population might, under circumstances
to be created by English policy,
prove the means of restraining
from an almost fratricidal contest the
two great empires. Ireland may become
so linked to England that any
blow struck against England would
equally harm Ireland. An enlightened
legislation concerning the soil of
Ireland may lead to the break-up of
absentee landlordism, and substitute
tens of thousands of owners and occupiers
in place of the few hundred feudal
proprietors who now exact rack-rents
from an impoverished tenantry.
The multiplication of resident working
farm-owners may afford remunerative
and permanent occupation
to numerous agricultural laborers for
whom there now offers only an intermittent
and precarious employment.
The agricultural prosperity of Ireland
is a powerful bond of union with England,
the nearest and best market for
Irish produce. Another bond of union
may be found in the grant of legislative
independence, or such a modification
of the present parliamentary
system as may place the disposal of
purely Irish interests in the hands of
Irish representatives, satisfy the just
desires of the patriotic, and leave no
room for sentimental grievances to
fester into international feuds. The
Catholic religion, subjected to no disabilities
in either kingdom, and overshadowed
by no hostile establishment&mdash;for
Englishmen themselves in a few
years will remove their present church
establishment in the interests of their
church and of Protestantism&mdash;will
form another tie between the countries.
English Catholics have always
been loyal to the British government.
Irish Catholics may become just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
loyal. Education may render the
rough Irish laborers, who frequent
the centres of English commerce and
manufacture, as loyal as the most loyal
in England, and a valuable counterpoise
to the ultra-democratic semi-infidels
who form the dangerous mobs
of London, Liverpool, and other vast
trading and industrial cities. And if
the social and political interests of
Catholic Irishmen and of Catholics
in England become recognized as
identical with those of English Protestants,
then the union between Great
Britain and Ireland will be completely
consolidated, and the Irish party in
America will have neither excuse nor
opportunity for joining any other party
which may desire, disregarding the
welfare of Ireland, to inflict a wound
upon Great Britain. On the contrary,
the Irish and Catholic element
in the States will be both able and
willing to throw its effective influence
into the scale upon the side of peace
and good-will, whenever the differences
between the cabinets of London and
Washington demand settlement. Ireland
will thus indirectly become the
mediator between the contending empires&mdash;the
arbiter to reconcile the angry
parent and the aggrieved son. But
Ireland, to be enabled to act this part,
must be cherished as Irish and Catholic,
with its nationality unimpaired and
its faith untrammelled. And if the political
interests of Great Britain shall
be served by the flourishing condition
of Irish Catholicism, the religious interests
of Protestant England will not
necessarily be damaged. Nay, it may
prove an advantage to Protestantism
to be brought upon equal terms into
close and harmonious relations with the
fervent faith of the Catholic Church,
which nowhere appears to greater advantage
than in Ireland. Rationalism
and scepticism are on the increase
in Great Britain and elsewhere,
and will prove far more dangerous
neighbors than the Church of Rome
to the Church of England. Infidelity
is an enemy against whom both
would do well, if not to unite their
strength, at least to direct their separate
attacks. As rivals in opposing
vice and unbelief, they may learn to respect
each other, and, alas! have before
them a field only too ample for
their most vigorous exertions.</p>

<h2>EMERSON'S PROSE WORKS.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></h2>


<p>Mr. Emerson's literary reputation
is established, and placed beyond the
reach of criticism. No living writer
surpasses him in his mastery of pure
and classic English, or equals him in
the exquisite delicacy and finish of his
chiselled sentences, or the metallic
ring of his style. It is only as a
thinker and teacher that we can venture
any inquiry into his merits; and
as such we cannot suffer ourselves to
be imposed upon by his oracular manner,
nor by the apparent originality
either of his views or his expressions.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson has had a swarm
both of admirers and of detractors.
With many he is a philosopher and
sage, almost a god; while with others
he is regarded as an unintelligible
mystic, babbling nonsense just fitted
to captivate beardless young men and
silly maidens with pretty curls, who
constituted years ago the great body
of his hearers and worshippers. We
rank ourselves in neither class, though
we regard him as no ordinary man,
and as one of the deepest thinkers, as
well as one of the first poets, of our
country. We know him as a polished
gentleman, a genial companion,
and a warm-hearted friend, whose
kindness does not pass over individuals
and waste itself in a vague philanthropy.
So much, at least, we can
say of the man, and from former personal
acquaintance as well as from the
study of his writings.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson is no theorist, and is
rather of a practical than of a speculative
turn of mind. What he has
sought all his life, and perhaps is still
seeking, is the real, the universal, and
the permanent in the events of life
and the objects of experience. The
son of a Protestant minister, brought
up in a Protestant community, and
himself for some years a Protestant
minister, he early learned that the
real, the universal, and permanent are
not to be found in Protestantism;
and assuming that Protestantism, in
some or all its forms, is the truest
exponent of the Christian religion, he
very naturally came to the conclusion
that they are not to be found in Christianity.
He saw that Protestantism
is narrow, hollow, unreal, a sham, a
humbug, and, ignorant of the Catholic
Church and her teaching, he considered
that she must have less of reality,
be even more of a sham or humbug,
than Protestantism itself. He passed
then naturally to the conclusion that
all pretensions to a supernaturally revealed
religion are founded only in
ignorance or craft, and rejected all
of all religions, except what may be
found in them that accords with the
soul or the natural reason of all men.
This may be gathered from his brief
essay, entitled <cite>Nature</cite>, first published
in 1836. We quote a few paragraphs
from the introduction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our age is retrospective. It builds the
sepulchres of the fathers. It writes biographies,
histories, and criticism. The foregoing
generations beheld God and nature
face to face; we through their eyes. Why
should not we also enjoy an original relation
to the universe? Why should not we have
a poetry and a philosophy of insight and not
of tradition, and a religion by revelation to
us, and not a history of theirs?... The
sun shines to-day also. There is more wool
and flax in the fields. There are new lands,
new men, new thoughts. Let us demand our
own works, and laws, and worship.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly we have no questions to
ask which are unanswerable. We must
trust the perfection of creation so far as to
believe that whatever curiosity the order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
things has awakened in our minds, the order
of things can satisfy. Every man's condition
is a solution in hieroglyphic to those
inquiries he would put. He acts it as life
before he apprehends it as truth. In like
manner, nature is already, in its forms and
tendencies, describing its own design. Let
us interrogate the great apparition that
shines so peacefully around us. Let us inquire,
To what end is nature?</p>

<p>"All science has one aim, to find a theory
of nature. We have theories of races and
of functions, but scarcely yet a remote approach
to an idea of creation. We are now
so far from the road to truth that religious
teachers dispute and hate each other, and
speculative men are deemed unsound and
frivolous. But to a sound judgment, the
most abstract truth is the most practical.
Whenever a true theory appears, it will be
its own evidence. Its test is, that it will
explain all phenomena. Now many are
thought not only unexplained, but inexplicable&mdash;as
language, sleep, madness, dreams,
beasts, sex." (Vol. i. pp. 5, 6.)</p></blockquote>

<p>These extracts give us the key to
Mr. Emerson's thought, which runs
through all his writings, whether in
prose or poetry; though more fully
mastered and better defined in his
later productions, essays, and lectures,
than it was in his earliest production
from which we have quoted. In studying
these volumes, we are convinced
that what the writer is after is
reality, of which this outward, visible
universe, both as a whole and in all
its parts, symbolizes. He seeks life,
not death; the living present, not the
corpse of the past. Under this visible
world, its various and ever-varying
phenomena, lies the real world,
one, identical, universal, and immutable,
which it copies, mimics, or
symbolizes. He agrees with Plato
that the real thing is in the methexis,
not in the mimesis; that is, in the
idea, not in the individual and the
sensible, the variable and the perishable.
He wants unity and catholicity,
and the science that does not attain
to them is no real science at all.
But as the mimesis, in his language
the hieroglyphic, copies or imitates
the methexic, we can, by studying it,
arrive at the methexic, the reality
copied or imitated.</p>

<p>We do not pretend to understand
Plato throughout, nor to reconcile
him always with himself; but as far
as we do understand him, the reality,
what must be known in order to have
real science, is the idea, and it is only
by ideas that real science is attained.
Ideas are, then, both the object and
the medium of knowledge. As the
medium of knowledge, the idea may
be regarded as the image it impresses
on the mimetic, or the individual and
the sensible, as the seal on the wax.
This image or impression is an exact
<i>fac-simile</i> of the idea as object. Hence
by studying it we arrive at the exact
knowledge of the idea, or what is
real, invariable, universal, and permanent
in the object we would know.
The lower copies and reveals the next
higher, and thus we may rise, step by
step, from the lowest to the highest,
to "the first good and the first fair," to
the good, the beautiful, or Being that
is being in itself. Thus is it in science.
But the soul has two wings on
which it soars to the empyrean, intelligence
and love. The lowest form
or stage of love is that of the sexes,
a love of the senses only; but this
lowest love symbolizes a higher or
ideal love, rising stage by stage to
the pure ideal, or the love of absolute
beauty, the beautiful in itself, the love
to which the sage aspires, and the
only love in which he can rest or find
repose.</p>

<p>We do not say that Mr. Emerson
follows Plato in all respects; for he
occasionally deviates from him, sometimes
for the better, and sometimes
for the worse; but no one not tolerably
well versed in the Platonic philosophy
can understand him. In his
two essays on Plato, in his second volume,
he calls him the Philosopher,
and asserts that all who talk philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
talk Plato. He also maintains
that Plato represented all the ages
that went before him, possessed all
the science of his contemporaries, and
that none who have come after him
have been able to add any thing new
to what he taught. He includes
Christianity, Judaism, and Mohammedanism
in Plato, who is far broader
and more comprehensive than them
all. Plato of all men born of woman
stood nearest the truth of things, and
in his intellectual and moral doctrines
surpassed all who went before or have
come after him.</p>

<p>We find many things in Plato that
we like, and we entirely agree with
him that the ideal is real; but we do
not agree with Mr. Emerson, that nothing
in science has been added to
the Platonic doctrine. We think Aristotle
made an important addition in
his doctrine of entelechia; Leibnitz,
in his definition of substance, making
it a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis activa</i>, and thus exploding the
notion of passive or inert substances;
and finally, Gioberti, by his doctrine of
creation as a doctrine, or rather principle,
of science. Plato had no conception
of the creative act asserted
by Moses in the first verse of <i>Genesis</i>.
Plato never rose above the conception
of the production of existences by
way of formation, or the operation
of the plastic force on a preÃ«xisting
and often intractable matter. He
never conceived of the creation of
existences from nothing by the sole
energy or power of the creator. He
held to the eternal existence of spirit
and matter, and we owe to him principally
the dualism and antagonism
that have originated the false asceticism
which many attribute to Christian
teaching; but which Christianity
rejects, as is evident from its doctrine
of the Incarnation and that of
the resurrection of the flesh. Gioberti
has shown, as the writer thinks,
that creation is no less a scientific
principle than a Christian dogma.
He has shown that the creative act
is the nexus between being and existences,
and that it enters as the copula
into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primum philosophicum</i>,
without which there could be no human
mind, and consequently no human
science. There are various other
instances we might adduce in which
people talk very good sense, even
profound philosophical and theological
truth, and yet do not talk Plato.
We hardly think Mr. Emerson himself
will accept all the moral doctrines
of Plato's Republic, especially those
relating to marriage and the promiscuous
intercourse of the sexes; for
Plato goes a little beyond what our
free-lovers have as yet proposed.</p>

<p>Aristotle gives us, undoubtedly, a
philosophy, such as it is, and a philosophy
that enters largely into modern
modes of thought and expression;
but we can hardly say as much of
Plato. He has profound thoughts,
no doubt, and many glimpses of a
high&mdash;if you will, the highest order of
truth; but only when he avowedly
follows tradition, and speaks according
to the wisdom of the ancients.
He seems to us to give us a method
rather than a philosophy, and very
little of our modern philosophical language
is derived from him. Several
of the Greek fathers, and St. Augustine
among the Latins, incline to
Platonism; but none of them, so far
as we are acquainted with them, followed
him throughout. The mediÃ¦val
doctors, though not ignorant of
Plato, almost without an exception
prefer Aristotle. The revival of Platonism
in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries brought with it a revival of
heathenism; and Plato has since been
held in much higher esteem with the
heterodox and makers of fanciful
systems than with the orthodox and
simple believers. We trace his influence
in what the romancers call chivalry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
which is of pagan origin, though
some people are ill-informed enough
to accredit it to the church; and we
trace to his doctrine of love, so attractive
to many writers not in other
respects without merit, the modern
babble about "the heart," the confusion
of charity with philanthropy, and
the immoral doctrines of free love,
which strike at Christian marriage and
the Christian family. The "heart,"
in the language of the Holy Scriptures,
means the affections of the will, and
the love they enjoin as the fulfilment
of the law and the bond of perfection
is charity, a supernatural virtue,
in which both the will and the understanding
are operative, not a simple,
natural sentiment, or affection of the
sensibility, or the love of the beautiful,
and dependent on the imagination.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson is right enough in
making the sensible copy or imitate
the intelligible, what there is true in
Swedenborg's doctrine of correspondences;
but wrong in making the mimetic
purely phenomenal, unreal, a
mere sense-show. The mimetic, the
mimesis, by which Plato means the
individual and the sensible, the variable
and the transitory, is not the only
real, nor the highest real, as sensists
and materialists hold; but is as real
in its order and degree as the methexic
or ideal. Hence, St. Thomas
is able to maintain that the sensible
species, or accidents, as he calls
them, can subsist without their subject,
or, as we would say, the sensible
body without the intelligible body;
and therefore, that the doctrine of transubstantiation
involves no contradiction;
for it is not pretended that the
sensible body undergoes any change,
or that the sensible body of our Lord
is present in the blessed eucharist.
So St. Augustine distinguishes the visible&mdash;the
sensible&mdash;body and the spiritual&mdash;intelligible&mdash;body,
and holds
both to be real. The individual is as
real as the species&mdash;the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socratitas</i>, in
the language of the schoolmen, as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">humanitas</i>&mdash;for neither is possible
without the other. The sort of idealism,
as it is called, that resolves the
individual into the species, or the sensible
into the intelligible, and thus
denies the external world, is as unphilosophical
as the opposite doctrine,
that resolves the species into the individual
and the intelligible into the
sensible. Even Plato, the supposed
father of idealism, does not make the
mimesis absolutely unreal. For, to
say nothing of the preÃ«xistent matter,
the image, picture, which is the exact
copy of its ideal prototype, is a real
image, picture, or copy.</p>

<p>But Mr. Emerson, if he recognizes
the methexis at all, either confounds
it with real and necessary being, or
makes it purely phenomenal, and
therefore unreal, as distinguished from
real and necessary being. Methexis
is a Greek word, and means, etymologically
and as used by Plato, participation.
Plato's doctrine is, that all
inferior existences exist by participation
of the higher, through the medium
of what he calls the plastic soul,
whence the Demiourgos of the Gnostics.
His error was in making the
plastic soul instead of the creative act
of God the medium of the participation.
Still, Plato made it the participation
of ideas or the ideal, and, in
the last analysis, of Him who is being
in himself. Hence, he made a distinction,
if not the proper distinction,
between the methexis and God, or
being by participation and the absolute
underived being, or being in
itself.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson recognizes no real
participation, and either excludes the
methexis or identifies it with God, or
absolute being. He thus reduces the
categories, as does Cousin, to being
and phenomenon, or, in the only barbarism
in language he permits himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">ME</span>&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le moi</i>&mdash;and the <span class="smcap">NOT ME</span>&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
non moi</i>&mdash;the root-error, so to speak,
of Fichte. He takes himself as the
central force, and holds it to be the
reality expressed in the <span class="smcap">NOT ME</span>. The
<span class="smcap">NOT ME</span> being purely phenomenal,
only the <span class="smcap">ME</span> is real. By the <span class="smcap">ME</span> he,
of course, does not mean his own
personality, but the reality which underlies
and expresses itself in it. The
absolute <span class="smcap">Ich</span>, or ego, of Fichte is identical
in all men, is the real man, the
"one man," as Mr. Emerson says;
and this "one man" is the reality,
the being, the substance, the force
of the whole phenomenal universe.
There is, then, no methexis imitated,
copied, or mimicked by the mimesis, or
the individual and sensible universe.
The mimesis copies not a participated
or created intelligible, but, however
it may be diversified by degrees,
it copies directly God himself, the
one real being and only substance of
all things. If we regard ourselves
as phenomenal, we are unreal, and
therefore nothing; if as real, as substantive,
as force, we do not participate,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mediante</i> the creative act, of real
being, but are identically it, or identical
with it; which makes the author
not only a pantheist, but a more unmitigated
pantheist than Plato himself.</p>

<p>Neither Plato nor Mr. Emerson
recognizes any causative force in the
mimesis. Plato recognizes causative
force only in ideas, though he concedes
a power of resistance to the
preÃ«xistent matter, and finds in its intractableness
the cause of evil; Mr.
Emerson recognizes causative or productive
force only in the absolute,
and therefore denies the existence of second
causes, as he does all distinction
between first cause and final cause;
which is the very essence of pantheism,
which Gioberti rightly terms the
"supreme sophism."</p>

<p>We have used the Greek terms
<i>methexis</i> and <i>mimesis</i> after Plato, as
Gioberti has done in his posthumous
works, but not precisely in Gioberti's
sense. Gioberti identifies the methexis
with the plastic soul asserted
by Plato, and revived by old Ralph
Cudworth, an Anglican divine of the
seventeenth century; but though we
make the methexis causative in the
order of second causes, we do not
make it productive of the mimesis.
It means what are called genera and
species; but even in the order of second
causes, genera are generative or
productive only as specificated, and
species only as individualized. God
must have created the genus specificated
and the species individualized
before either could be active or productive
as second cause. The genus
does not and cannot exist without
specification, nor the species without
individualization, any more than the
individual can exist without the species,
or the species without the genus.
For instance, man is the species, according
to the schoolmen, the genus
is animal, the <i>differentia</i> is reason,
and hence man is defined a rational
animal. But the genus animal,
though necessary to its existence, cannot
generate the species man, any
more than it could have generated
itself. The species can exist only as
immediately individuated by the first
cause, and hence the pretence of some
scientists&mdash;more properly sciolists,&mdash;that
new species are formed either by
development or by natural selection,
is simply absurd, as has been well
shown by the Duke of Argyll. God
creates the species as well as the genera;
and it is fairly inferred from
the Scriptures that he creates all
things in their genera and species
"after their kind." Furthermore, if
God had not created the human
species individualized in Adam, male
and female, there could have been no
men by natural generation, any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
than if there had been no human
species at all.</p>

<p>This, as we understand it, excludes
alike the plastic soul of the Platonists
and the Demiourgos of the Gnostics,
and teaches that the mimesis is as
directly created by God himself as
the methexis. Mr. Emerson, indeed,
uses neither of these Platonic terms,
though if he had, he would, with his
knowledge of the Christian doctrine
of creation, have detected the error
of Plato, and most likely have escaped
his own. The term <i>methexis</i>&mdash;participation&mdash;excludes
the old error
that God generates the universe,
which is rather favored by the terms
genera and species. We use the term
<i>mimesis</i> because it serves to us to express
the fact that the lower copies
or imitates the higher, and therefore
the doctrine of St. Thomas, that
"Deus est similitudo rerum omnium,"
or that God is himself the type or
model after which the universe is created,
and which each and every existence
in its own order and degree strives to
copy or represent. The error of Plato
is, that he makes the methexis an
emanation rather than a creature, and
the plastic power that produces the
mimesis; the error of Mr. Emerson,
as we view the matter, is, that he
makes the mimetic purely phenomenal,
therefore unreal, sinks it in the
methexic, and the methexis itself in
God, as the one only being or substance,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">natura naturans</i> of Spinoza.</p>

<p>With Plato, the mimesis is the product
of the methexic, but is itself passive,
and the sooner the soul is emancipated
from it the better; though what
is the soul in his system of ideas we understand
not. With Mr. Emerson, it
is neither active nor passive, for it is
purely phenomenal, therefore nothing.
With us it is real, and, like all real existences,
it is active, and is not a simple
image or copy of the methexic or
the ideal, but is in its order and degree
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis activa</i>, and copies or imitates
actively the divine type or the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">idea exemplaris</i> in the divine mind,
after which it is created.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson says, in the introduction
to his essay on <i>Nature</i>, "Philosophically
considered, the universe is
composed of nature and soul." But
all activity is in the soul, and what is
distinguishable from the soul is purely
phenomenal, and, if we may take his
essay on the <i>Over-soul</i>, not republished
in these volumes, is but the soul's
own projection of itself. The soul
alone is active, productive, and it is
myself, my own ego; not indeed in its
personal limitations and feebleness,
but in its absoluteness, as the absolute
or impersonal <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich</i> of Fichte, and
identically God, who is the great, the
absolute <span class="smcap">I am</span>.</p>

<p>The error is obvious. It consists
in the denial or in the overlooking of
the fact that God creates substances,
and that every substance is, as Leibnitz
defines it, a force, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis activa</i>,
acting always from its own centre
outward. Whatever actually exists
is active, and there is and can be no
passivity in nature. Hence, Aristotle
and the schoolmen after him call
God, who is being and being in its
plenitude, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actus purissimus</i>, or most
pure act, in whom there are no possibilities
to be actualized. Mr. Emerson
errs in his first principles, in not recognizing
the fact that God creates
substances, and that every substance
is an activity, therefore causative either
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad intra</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad extra</i>, and that every
created substance is causative in
the order of second causes. What
we maintain in opposition both to
him and Plato is, that these created
substances are at once methexic and
mimetic in their activity.</p>

<p>It were an easy task to show that
whatever errors there may be, or may
be supposed to be, in Mr. Emerson's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
works grow out of the two fundamental
errors we have indicated&mdash;the
identification of soul, freed from its
personal limitations, as in Adam,
John, and Richard, with God, or the
real being, substance, force, or activity,
and the assumption that whatever
is distinguishable from God is purely
phenomenal, an apparition, a sense-show,
a mere bubble on the surface
of the ocean of being, as we pointed
out in our comments on the proceedings
of the Free Religionists, in the
magazine for last November, and to
which we beg leave to refer our readers.</p>

<p>Yet, though we have known Mr.
Emerson personally ever since 1836,
have held more than one conversation
with him, listened to several
courses of lectures from him, and
read and even studied the greater
part, if not all of his works, as they
issued from the press, we must confess
that, in reperusing them preparatory
to writing this brief notice, we
have been struck, as we never were
before, with the depth and breadth
of his thought, as well as with the
singular force and beauty of his expression.
We appreciate him much
higher both as a thinker and as an
observer, and we give him credit for
a depth of feeling, an honesty of purpose,
an earnest seeking after truth, we
had not previously awarded him in so
great a degree, either publicly or privately.
We are also struck with his
near approach to the truth as we are
taught it. He seems to us to come
as near to the truth as one can who
is so unhappy as to miss it.</p>

<p>We regard it as Mr. Emerson's
great misfortune, that his early Protestant
training led him to regard
the Catholic question as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res adjucata</i>,
and to take Protestantism, in some
one or all of its forms, as the truest
and best exponent of Christianity.
Protestantism is narrow, superficial,
unintellectual, vague, indefinite, sectarian,
and it was easy for a mind
like his to pierce through its hollow
pretensions, to discover its unspiritual
character, its want of life, its formality,
and its emptiness. It was not difficult
to comprehend that it was only
a dead corse, and a mutilated corse
at that. The Christian mysteries it
professed to retain, as it held them,
were lifeless dogmas, with no practical
bearing on life, and no reason in
the world for believing them. Such
a system, having no relation with the
living and moving world, and no reason
in the nature or constitution of
things, could not satisfy a living and
thinking man, in downright earnest
for a truth at least as broad and as
living as his own soul. It was too
little, too insignificant, too <i>mesquine</i>,
too much of a dead and putrefying
body to satisfy either his intellect or
his heart. If that is the true exponent
of Christianity, and the most
enlightened portion of mankind say
it is, why shall I belie my own understanding,
my own better nature,
by professing to believe and reverence
it? No; let me be a man, be true
to myself, to my own reason and instincts,
not a miserable time-server or
a contemptible hypocrite.</p>

<p>If Mr. Emerson had not been led
to regard the Catholic question as
closed, except to the dwellers among
tombs, and to the ignorant and superstitious,
and had studied the church
with half the diligence he has Plato,
Mohammed, or Swedenborg, it is
possible that he would have found
in Christianity the life and truth,
the reality, unity, and catholicity he
has so long and so earnestly sought
elsewhere and found not. Certain
it is, that whatever affirmative truth
he holds is held and taught by the
church in its proper place, its real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
relations, and in its integrity. The
church does not live in the past
nor dwell only among tombs; she
is an ever-present and ever-living
church, and presents to us not a dead
historical Christ, but the ever-living
and ever-present Christ, as really and
truly present to us as he was to the
disciples and apostles with whom he
conversed when he went about in
Judea doing good, without having
where to lay his head, and not more
veiled from our sight now than he
was then from theirs. Does she not
hold the sublime mystery of the Real
Presence, which, if an individual fact,
is also a universal principle?</p>

<p>The Christian system, if we may so
speak, is not an after-thought in creation,
or something superinduced on
the Creator's works. It has its ground
and reason in the very constitution
of things. All the mysteries taught
or dogmas enjoined by the church
are universal principles; they are truly
catholic, the very principles according
to which the universe, visible or
invisible, is constructed, and not one
of them can be denied without denying
a first principle of life and of
science. Mr. Emerson says, in a passage
we have quoted, "All science
has one aim, namely, to find a theory
of nature," and seems to concede
that it has not yet succeeded in finding
it. The church goes beyond even
the aim of science, and gives, at least
professes to give, not a theory of truth,
but the truth itself; she is not a method,
but that to which the true method
leads. She is the body of Him
who is "the way, the truth, and the
life;" she gives us, not as the philosophers,
her views of the truth, but the
truth itself, in its reality, its unity, its
integrity, its universality, its immutability.
At least such is her profession;
for the faith she teaches is the substance&mdash;hypostasis&mdash;of
the things to
be hoped for, and the evidence of
things not seen&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">substantia sperandarum,
argumentum non apparentium</i>.</p>

<p>Such being her profession, made
long before Protestantism was born,
and continued to be made since with
no stammering tongue or abatement
of confidence, the pretence that
judgment has gone against her is unfounded.
Many have condemned
her, as the Jewish Sanhedrim condemned
our Lord, and called on the
Roman Procurator to execute judgment
against him; but she has no
more staid condemned than he
staid confined in the new tomb hewn
from the rock in which his body was
laid, and far more are they who admit
her professions among the enlightened
and civilized than they who
deny them. No man has a right to
be regarded as a philosopher or sage
who has not at least thoroughly examined
her titles, and made up his mind
with a full knowledge of the cause.</p>

<p>In the Catholic Church we have
found the real presence, and unity,
and catholicity which we sought
long and earnestly, and could find nowhere
else, and which Mr. Emerson,
after a still longer and equally earnest
search, has not found at all. He
looks not beyond nature, and nature
is not catholic, universal, or the whole.
It is not one, but manifold and variable.
It cannot tell its origin, medium,
or end. With all the light Mr.
Emerson has derived from nature, or
from nature and soul united, there is
infinite darkness behind, infinite darkness
before, and infinite darkness all
around him. He says, "Every man's
condition is a solution in hieroglyphic
of those inquiries he would put."
Suppose it is so, what avail is that to
him who has lost or never had the
key to the hieroglyph? Knows he to
interpret the hieroglyph in which the
solution is concealed? Can he read
the riddle of the sphinx? He has
tried his hand at it in his poem of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Sphinx, and has only been able to answer
that</p>

<p class="center">
"Each answer is a lie."<br />
</p>

<p>It avails us little to be told where the
solution is, if we are not told what it
is, or if only told that every solution
is false as soon as told. Hear him;
to man he says,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Thou art the unanswered question;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Couldst see thy proper eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alway it asketh, asketh;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And each answer is a lie:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So take thy quest through nature,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It through a thousand natures ply;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask on, thou clothed eternity;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Time is the false reply."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The answer, if it means any thing,
means that man is "a clothed eternity,"
whatever that may mean, eternally
seeking an answer to the mystery
of his own being, and each answer
he can obtain is a lie; for only
eternity can comprehend eternity and
tell what it is. Whence has he learned
that man, the man-child, is "a clothed
eternity," and therefore God, who
only is eternal?</p>

<p>Now, eternity is above time, and
above the world of time, consequently
above nature. Catholicity, by the
very force of the term, must include
all truth, and therefore the truth of
the supernatural as well as of the natural.
But Mr. Emerson denies the
supernatural, and does not, of course,
even profess to have any knowledge
that transcends nature. How, then,
can he pretend to have attained to
catholic truth? He himself restricts
nature to the external universe, which
is phenomenal, and to soul, by which
he means himself. But are there no
phenomena without being or substance
which appears or which shows
itself in them? Is this being or substance
the soul, or, in the barbarism
he adopts, the <span class="smcap">ME</span>? If so, the <span class="smcap">NOT-ME</span>
is only the phenomena of the <span class="smcap">ME</span>,
and of course identical with myself,
as he implies in what he says of the
"one man." Then in me, and emanating
from me, are all men, and the
whole of nature. How does he know
this? Does he learn it from nature?</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Emerson means
not this, even if his various utterances
imply it. He uses the word <i>creation</i>,
and we suppose he intends, notwithstanding
his systematic views, if
such he has, contradict it, to use it in
its proper sense. Then he must hold
the universe, including, according to
his division, nature and soul, has been
created, and if created, it has a creator.
The creator must be superior, above
nature and soul, and therefore in the
strictest sense of the word supernatural;
and as reason is the highest faculty
of the soul, the supernatural
must also be supra-rational.</p>

<p>Does the creator create for a purpose,
for an end? and if so, what is
that end or purpose, and the medium
or means of fulfilling it, whether on
his part or on the part of the creature?
Here, then, we have the assertion
of a whole order of truth, very
real and very important to be known,
which transcends the truth Mr. Emerson
professes to have, and which is
not included in it. We say again,
then, that he has not attained to catholicity,
and we also say that, by the
only method he admits, he cannot
attain to it. How can he pretend to
have attained to catholicity, and that
he has already a truth more universal
than Christianity reveals, when he
must confess that without the knowledge
of a supernatural and supra-rational
truth he cannot explain his
origin or end, or know the conditions
of his existence, or the means of gaining
his end?</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson says, as we have
quoted him,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Undoubtedly we have no questions to
ask which are unanswerable. We must
trust the perfection of the creation so far as
to believe that whatever curiosity the order
of things has awakened in our minds, the
order of things can satisfy."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alway it asketh, asketh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each answer is a lie.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is here a grand mistake. If
he had said the Creator instead of
creation, there would have been truth
and great propriety in the author's assertion.
Nature&mdash;and we mean by nature
the whole created order&mdash;excites
us to ask many very troublesome
questions, which nature is quite incompetent
to answer. The fact that
nature is created, proves that she is,
both as a whole and in all her parts,
dependent, not independent, and
therefore does not and cannot suffice
for herself. Unable to suffice for herself,
she cannot suffice for the science
of herself; for science must be of that
which is, not of that which is not.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson, we presume, struck
with the narrowness and inconsistencies
of all the religions he had studied,
and finding that they are all
variable and transitory in their forms,
yet thought that he also discovered
something in them, or underlying them
all, which is universal, invariable, and
permanent, and which they are all
honest efforts of the great soul to realize.
He therefore came to the conclusion
that the sage can accept none
of these narrow, variable, and transitory
forms, and yet can reject none
of them as to the great, invariable,
and underlying principles, which in
fact is all they have that is real or
profitable. To distinguish between
the transient and permanent in religion
was the common aim of the
Boston movement from 1830 to 1841,
when we ourselves began to turn our
own mind, though very timidly and
at a great distance, toward the church.
Mr. Emerson, Miss Margaret Fuller,
A. Bronson Alcott, and Mr. Theodore
Parker regarded the permanent elements
of all religions as the natural
patrimony or products of human nature.
The present writer differed
from them, by ascribing their origin
to supernatural revelation made to
our first parents in the garden, universally
diffused by the dispersion of
the race, and transmitted to us by
the traditions of all nations. Following
out this view, the grace of God
moving and assisting, we found our
way to the Catholic Church, in which
the form and the invariable and permanent
principle, or rather, the form
growing out of the principle, are inseparable,
and are fitted by the divine
hand to each other.</p>

<p>The others, falling back on a sort
of transcendental illuminism, sunk into
pure naturalism, where such of them
as are still living, and a whole brood
of young disciples who have sprung
up since, remain, and, like the old
Gnostics, suppose themselves spiritual
men and women in possession of the
secret of the universe. There was
much life, mental activity, and honest
purpose in the movement; but
those who had the most influence in
directing its course could not believe
that any thing good could come out
of Nazareth, and so turned their backs
on the church. They thought they
could find something deeper, broader,
and more living than Christianity,
and have lost not only the transient,
but even the permanent in religion.</p>

<h2>THE HOLY-WEEK OF 1869 IN HAVANA.<br />

<small>GOOD-FRIDAY. HOLY-SATURDAY. EASTER-SUNDAY.</small></h2>


<h3>GOOD-FRIDAY.</h3>

<p>Sad indeed was the aspect of all
things within the cathedral on Good-Friday
morning. Black draperies
covered the pulpit, reading-desks, and
seats reserved for the authorities, and
every one was attired in mourning.
Instead of the rose-color and blue of
Holy-Thursday, the ladies now wore
black or violet silks and satins with jet
ornaments.</p>

<p>All the personages of the preceding
day were present, and the religious
services were in nowise different from
those of the Catholic Church in other
lands, with the exception that, in the
reading of the passion, at the words
"<i>gave up the ghost</i>," all knelt, but did
not kiss the ground, as is the custom
in France.</p>

<p>During the adoration of the cross,
in which the captain-general, apparently
almost too ill to stand, and the other
gentlemen took part, the choir sang
the beautiful hymn <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pange lingua</i>, with
its tender burden of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crux fidelis</i>. Never
did it sound to me more touching.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Sing, O my tongue! the Victor's praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him the noblest trophy raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victory of his cross proclaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His glory and his laurelled fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing of his conquests, when he proved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saviour of the souls he loved.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O faithful cross! thou stand'st alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None like thee in our woods is grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None can with thy rich growth compare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or leaves like thine, or flowerets bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet wood, sweet nails, both sweet and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet is the precious weight ye bear."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The adoration terminated, the procession
was formed, exactly as on the
day before, to bring back the Blessed
Sacrament from the sepulchre. On
reaching the foot of the steps, the
captain-general delivered up to the bishop
the key he had worn suspended
from his neck since the preceding
morning. As the procession returned,
the noble strains of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vexilla regis</i>
resounded through the great church.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The standard of our King unfurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaims triumphant to the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cross, where Life would suffer death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gain life with his dying breath!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>My heart beat faster as I listened
to the glorious hymn!</p>

<p>The communion made, vespers
were chanted in grave and mournful
tones, and the service was concluded.
As the bishop descended the nave to
leave the cathedral, the little girls
of the nuns' schools crowded around
him to kiss his hand; and it was very
pretty to see them clasp his fingers,
and look up in his kind face with a
confiding smile.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As it had been officially announced
that the meditation on the seven
words of Jesus on the cross, with the
ceremony of the descent from the
cross, to be followed by the procession
of the interment, were to take
place, as is usual every year, that
afternoon in the church of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan
de Dios</i>, I determined to be present.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, accordingly, I stationed
myself in a shady corner, not
far from the principal entrance of
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan</i>, among a crowd of soldiers,
volunteers, and colored people. All
gazed at me inquisitively. I looked
like a lady; but my somewhat Andalusian
physiognomy, shaded by the
black lace mantilla, put them out a
little. I heard them at last decide
that I was an <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">estranjera</i>, (stranger,)
and consequently considered capable
of, and permitted, any eccentricity,
without derogating from my claim to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
respect. Twenty minutes passed away
thus; a south wind was blowing, and
great water-laden clouds were fast
covering the sky; the heat was very
oppressive, and soon heavy drops of
rain began to fall, and every one
rushed to shelter. I ran back to the
cathedral, my nearest refuge. The
<i>TenebrÃ¦</i> had just commenced, and
I sat there and listened to the doleful
lamentations of Jeremiah, and the
wails of the holy women, mingling
with the thunder-crashes and the
noise of the pouring rain, which fell as
it only falls within the tropics. It
was a combination of sounds not
easily to be forgotten.</p>

<p>At half-past four, the storm was
over, and the sky clear and blue once
more, so I determined to hasten to
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan</i>, and, though too late to
hear the meditation, still witness the
descent from the cross. To my surprise,
on going to the door I found
it impossible to leave the church;
the whole place in front of the cathedral
was knee-deep in water, and all
the streets leading from it looked like
swift-flowing rivers! Not until five
o'clock did the water subside sufficiently
to permit me to cross the
street conducting to <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan</i>, where,
however, I fortunately arrived in time
for the ceremony I so much wished
to see.</p>

<p>The high altar had been removed,
and in its place, on an elevated platform,
were erected three great crosses,
the centre one bearing the image,
large as life, of our Saviour, the other
two those of the thieves crucified with
him; the face of the repentant sinner
was turned lovingly toward his Lord,
that of the unrepentant looked away
with a scowl.</p>

<p>The figure of the victim was fearfully
natural&mdash;the pallor of death was
on his blood-stained brow, the gash
in his side, and his mangled hands
and feet were livid. Two priests,
mounted on ladders placed against
the arms of the cross, were in the act
of taking down the writing when I
got near enough to see well. At the
command of the preacher, who had
just finished the meditation, and who
directed them from the pulpit, they
then proceeded to draw out the nail
from the right hand; when loosened
from the tree, the arm fell stiffly and
as if dead; before the other was freed,
long and wide linen bands were passed
under both, and around the body,
to sustain it and prevent it from falling
forward. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Llorad lagrimas de sangre</i>&mdash;"Weep
tears of blood," cried
the preacher while this was being
done amid the breathless silence of
the spectators, "he died for you!"
So solemnly, so tenderly did the
priests perform their office, that it
seemed no representation, but dreadful
reality, and my cheeks grew cold,
and my heart throbbed painfully when
the pale, bruised body was gently
lowered and borne to the bier waiting
to receive it.</p>

<p>Yes, this cruel death He died for
us; but, O true and loving women!
one sweet and proud remembrance will
be ours for all eternity&mdash;<em>our</em> kiss betrayed
him not, nor <em>our</em> tongue denied&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"While even the apostle left him to his doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>We</em> lingered round his cross, and watched his tomb!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The preacher now descended from
the pulpit, and quitted the church in
company with the other assistant
priests; and the direction seemed to
be left in the hands of a fraternity
called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">los Hermanos de la Soledad</i>&mdash;the
Brethren of Solitude&mdash;a set of tall, fine-looking
black men, many with thin
lips and <em>almost</em> Roman noses. They
were dressed in robes of black glazed
calico, with white lace tippets.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour elapsed; the
church remained crowded, but there
were no signs of preparation for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
procession. Presently a handsome,
authoritative-mannered personage,
evidently a Spaniard, entered hastily,
and, pushing his way unceremoniously
through the people, sought the
members of the brotherhood, to whom
he evidently gave some orders, and
then went away. A great silence prevailed,
and every one seemed to be
waiting for something. I at last mustered
up courage to ask a brother when
the procession would commence.</p>

<p><i lang="es" xml:lang="es">No hay procesion hasta el aÃ±o que
viene</i>&mdash;"There will be no procession
until next year"&mdash;he answered in a
very loud voice.</p>

<p><i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pero, seÃ±or, en el diario</i>&mdash;"But, sir,
in the newspaper&mdash;" I began. "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">No hay
procesion hasta el aÃ±o que viene</i>," he
repeated louder still.</p>

<p>The women broke forth in murmurs;
but not a man spoke, though
compressed lips and scowling brows
showed sufficiently what was passing
within. I must not omit to remark
that the congregation consisted almost
entirely of colored creoles.</p>

<p>By dint of soft but firmly continued
pushing, and a pleasant smile when
the individual I elbowed looked grimly
at me, I forced my way out of the
disagreeable pack of volunteers and
negroes, men and boys, that surrounded
me, to the chancel, where I found
a number of well-dressed and respectable-looking
colored ladies seated on
the platform. There the discontent
was louder, and I understood distinctly
that the disappointment was attributed
more to the ill-will of their rulers
than to the bad state of the weather.
One woman, particularly, exclaimed
angrily several times, and sufficiently
loud to be heard by all in that
end of the building, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hay procesion
para los EspaÃ±oles, pero no para nosotros</i>&mdash;"There
are processions for the
Spaniards, but not for us."</p>

<p>However, there was nothing to be
done but to submit; so a few persons
went quietly away, and I at last succeeded
in obtaining a close view of
the bier. It was in the form of a sarcophagus
with open sides, placed on
a trestle concealed by black velvet
drapery spotted with silver stars; the
upper part very tastefully decorated
with white and lilac flowers. The image
lying within was covered with a
cloth of silver tissue, the head and
feet left bare. Close by stood another
trestle, also covered with ornamented
black velvet, and supporting a
small platform, on which stood the
figures of the Blessed Virgin, in deep
grief, holding in her hand a very handsome
lace pocket-handkerchief, and of
St. John, with a profusion of fair ringlets,
sustaining her in his arms. The
bier, followed by the Virgin and St.
John, carried by the members of the
black <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hermandad</i>, escorted by soldiers
and military music, and accompanied
by a vast number of people,
constitutes the "procession of the interment,"
which every Good-Friday
(when permitted) leaves the old church
of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan de Dios</i>, passes through
many streets of the city, and before
the palace of the captain-general, and
stops at the cathedral, into which it
enters, and where the images are finally
deposited with great solemnity.
This year, as we have seen, the procession
did not take place.</p>

<p>While examining with interest these
curious remains of the piety of the
first settlers in the island, I heard
some one cry out, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">No deja ninguno
salir</i>&mdash;"Let no one go out"&mdash;and at
the same moment saw some soldiers
lifting up and looking under the velvet
draperies as if searching for some
one. Five very uncomfortable minutes
followed; the door by which I
had entered was blocked up with soldiers
and volunteers, every one was
frightfully silent&mdash;and I am not a heroine!
At last the people were allowed
to go out by one door, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the soldiers and volunteers slowly filled
up the church by the other.</p>

<p>Exceedingly great was the relief I
felt when I found myself safely seated
in the cars, (which in consequence
of the rain had been permitted to
enter the city and station themselves
in their usual place,) and on my way
home, where I arrived very tired and
almost disgusted with sight-seeing.</p>


<h3>HOLY-SATURDAY.</h3>

<p>At seven o'clock in the morning of
the "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sabado de Gloria</i>," the "Saturday
of Glory," as the Spaniards beautifully
and expressively call this great
day, I was already established in my
usual place in the nave of the cathedral,
though the religious ceremonies
were not to commence until eight.
The attendance of the public generally
was less than on Maundy-Thursday
and Good-Friday, and none of the
superior authorities of Havana, nor
military and civil functionaries, were
present.</p>

<p>The new fire was lighted and blessed
precisely as is done with us, and
the five grains of incense placed on
the paschal candle; which, however,
was not a tall, thick taper, as in other
countries, but a veritable <i>pillar</i> of
wax, about a yard high and six inches
in diameter; transmitting to us
most probably an exact resemblance
of that column of wax upon which
the patriarch of Alexandria used to
inscribe the paschal epoch and the
movable feasts, and which in progress
of time was employed as a torch
during the paschal night, and at last
came to be regarded as the symbol
of the resuscitated Saviour, the true
light of the world.</p>

<p>After reading the prophecies, the
deacon, preceded by the holy cross
and the paschal candle, and accompanied
by the clergy and many of
the faithful present, went in procession
to bless the new water and the baptismal
fonts. This ceremony also was
performed exactly as it is with us.
At its conclusion the deacon returned
to the high altar, and after sprinkling
it and the congregation with the newly-blessed
water, the short mass of
the day commenced.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the officiating priest
begun to intone the <i>Gloria</i>, when the
central door of the church burst open,
letting in a flood of golden light; the
cannon fired, the drums beat, the bells
rang out, and the loud organ pealed
forth a triumphant strain, while voices
that seemed to come from heaven
repeated high and clear, with delicious
harmony, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria in excelsis Deo!</i></p>

<p>We all simultaneously fell on our
knees; for myself, I can say that never
in my life before had I experienced
such rapturous emotion. Never before
had I so perfectly realized the
triumph of life over death! Never
before, O my God! had I felt so deeply
what it was to praise thee, to bless
thee, to adore thee, to glorify thee
with my whole heart. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria in excelsis
Deo!</i></p>

<p>The Alleluia was chanted in the
same spirit of joy and exultation, and
the services concluded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Without the church all was now
gayety and bustle. The streets were
crowded as if by magic with vehicles
of every description. The shops were
all open; the sweetmeat and fruit-sellers
at their posts, looking as if
they had never been absent; the lottery-ticket
venders in full cry. The
horses and mules had their heads decorated
with bows and rosettes and
streamers of bright-colored ribbons,
and their tails elegantly plaited and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
tied up to one side of their saddle or
harness, with scarlet braid. Even the
quiet, patient oxen sported a bit of
finery, and wore flowers on the ponderous
yoke that weighed down their
gentle heads. Crowds of busy men
hurried hither and thither; gayly-dressed
ladies drove about in their stylish
quitrins; loud talking and laughing
was the order of the day among the
colored population; a riff-raff of little
blackies pervaded the city, happily
<em>without</em> the squibs, crackers, and fire-arms
permitted them until this year,
but quite sufficiently boisterous to be
intolerable; while the church-bells kept
ringing out, adding their clang to the
noisy confusion, and <em>not</em> with that
merry musical chime we are accustomed
to hear in England, the land
of the scientific, well-trained bell-ringer.
But, indeed, nowhere since I listened
years ago to the bells of Saint
Mary's in dear old smoky Manchester
have I heard a regular triple bob-major!</p>


<h3>EASTER-SUNDAY.</h3>

<p>The sun was not yet up when I
started for town on Easter morning.
The procession of the resurrection&mdash;called,
to distinguish it from other
processions of the resurrection, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">del
encuentro</i>, "of the meeting"&mdash;was to
commence at six o'clock, and I was
determined that no tardiness on my
part should prevent my seeing the
whole of this singular relic of bygone
ages. The transition from darkness
to light is so wonderfully sudden, however,
in these latitudes, that it was
broad day when I reached the cathedral,
which I found brilliantly illuminated
with wax tapers, and hung with
crimson damask draperies. Mass had
just begun, and there was a considerable
number of persons present, most
of them ladies, as is always the case
in the churches of Havana. How
the sight of the men-crowded churches
of the United States would astonish
these Cubans, who seem to believe
that religion is made for ignorant women
and children, and that the less they
profess to have, the more enlightened
they appear! As if the really enlightened
man were not he who most
deeply feels the necessity of his Maker's
care and love&mdash;the consolation
of addressing him in prayer!</p>

<p>As soon as the service was ended,
I hastened to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Calle Empedrado</i>,
the street leading directly from the
cathedral to <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan</i>, and took up
my station on the edge of the sidewalk,
about half-way between the
two churches. The balconies of the
houses and the sides of the great
barred, glassless windows were hung
with red and yellow draperies; and
gayly-dressed ladies and children, and
crowds of colored people, with the
inevitable volunteers, thronged the
streets. While thus waiting, I was
struck by the appearance of the dresses
of the greater part of the colored
creole women; nearly all wore red,
white, and blue, the antagonistic colors
to red and yellow. Their wearers,
in all probability, intended by
this show of their political opinions
to revenge themselves upon the Spaniards
for the loss of their much-loved
procession on Good-Friday.</p>

<p>There was soon a murmur of expectation
in the crowd around me,
and presently there appeared coming
toward us from <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan</i> the image,
large as life, of St. Mary Magdalen,
dressed in a skirt of silver tinsel, and
an open dress of blue satin, trimmed
with silver lace. A profusion of long
auburn ringlets flowed down each side
of the smiling face, and a very elaborate
gilded glory was affixed to the
back of the head. The arms were
slightly raised, and the hand held out.
This figure stood on a small platform
supported on the shoulders of four
of the Brethren of Solitude, such tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
men that the saint, as she advanced
rapidly, her curls streaming out behind
her, seemed to be running over
the heads of the spectators. As she
passed, all the men took off their hats
respectfully. The bearers halted just
in front of me, the Magdalen being
supposed to look toward the sepulchre;
after a few minutes' pause, she
suddenly turned and ran back to the
church of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan</i>. In order, probably,
to give a more natural appearance
to the image, the men who carried
it, and who evidently took extreme
delight and pride in the duty,
waddled as they ran, and so communicated
a most ludicrous deportment
to the saint. Every one laughed loud
as they watched her roll from side to
side, plunging forward from time to
time, and then recovering herself with
a jerk, her hair flopping up and down
or streaming out on the air.</p>

<p><i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Que bien corre, meneandose</i>&mdash;"How
well she runs, shaking herself!"&mdash;was
the admiring exclamation of several
persons near me, and they laughed;
yes, men, women, and children, black
and white, roared with laughter, and
yet, I verily believe, not one among
them all laughed in derision, or felt
the slightest sentiment of disrespect.
"Perfect love casteth out fear," says
the apostle; and it never entered into
their heads that the good saint could
be displeased because, like simple
children, they laughed at so artless a
representation of her. The grotesque
movements excited their hilarity, and
they were hilarious on the impulse of
the moment, and without <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arriÃ¨re pensÃ©e</i>.
The Latin race is sometimes remarkable
for a child-like simplicity in
its actions which too often is mistaken
by colder temperaments for a lack
of veneration and propriety.</p>

<p>In a little while the saint came running
down the street again, saluted
respectfully again by the merry crowd.
A halt of five minutes, while she looked
earnestly in the direction of the
sepulchre, and then she turned and
rushed back, more violently agitated
than before, and amidst reiterated
shouts of laughter, to <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan de
Dios</i>, to tell the Blessed Virgin the
good tidings that her Son was alive
again.</p>

<p>And now the loud strains of martial
music reached our ears, and we saw
emerging from the square in front of
the cathedral, and slowly advancing
toward us, a high, handsome structure
carried on the shoulders of a member
of the black <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hermandad</i>. In the centre
of it stood the image of the risen
Saviour, crowned with a radiant glory;
his right hand extended as if to
welcome, his left grasping a white
and gold banner, which displayed,
when the breeze unfurled its folds, a
blood-red cross. A little angel with
outspread wings seemed to hover in
front of the gorgeous fabric, as if to
herald the coming Lord. A regiment
of colored soldiers, wearing white drill
uniforms with red facings, escorted
this triumphal car, the band playing
its gayest airs.</p>

<p>At the same moment the Holy Virgin,
attired in gold-colored silk damask,
with a magnificent halo around
her head, appeared at the opposite
end of the street coming to meet him.
She was followed at a short distance
by St. Mary Magdalen, now more
subdued in manner. The Virgin's arms
were raised as if about to clasp them
around her beloved Son, and her face
wore an expression of ecstatic joy.</p>

<p>The two processions met where I
stood, and after a short pause, St.
Mary Magdalen, who was the nearest
to the church of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Juan de Dios</i>,
turned round and led the way thither,
the Virgin turning also, and the two
processions now forming but one.
Slowly, but to the liveliest music, in
which mingled the strains of Riesgo's
hymn, the whole mass of us&mdash;for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
spectators fell into the ranks&mdash;moved
onward, every one looking glad and
gay, and so we at last reached the old
church, which was far too small to
contain one half of us, and the images
entered one after the other with
all the assistants who could force their
way in. We weaker vessels, left outside,
seeing it hopeless to try to get
in, soon dispersed. I have since learnt
that no kind of religious ceremony
took place; the images were simply
set down, and after a while the church
was cleared of the people and closed
for an hour or two.</p>

<p>There are processions of the resurrection
from a great number of churches
perambulating the city every Easter-Sunday;
but this one "of the
Meeting," is by far the most curious
and interesting. That of the church
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Espiritu Santo</i> is considered
one of the prettiest, because of the
children in fancy dresses that take
part in it. This year, I was told, a
great majority of them wore volunteer
or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cantinera</i> (canteen-women, or
sutler) costumes, to the great disgust
of Cuban mothers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was, of course, much festivity
going on in the city and suburbs all
that day. There were family meetings
and the pleasant <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">retreta</i> in the evening
for some; the theatre and public
balls for others; and, I am sorry to
say, there was cock-fighting for that
brutal minority which in all countries
seems to seek its greatest enjoyment
in the contemplation of bloody strife.</p>

<p>Yet, in sad truth, there had been
strife enough in the streets of Havana
during the past week to have contented
the most sanguinary temper,
and sorrow enough to have softened
the hardest. Palm-Sunday had witnessed
the farewell to all that was
dear to them of two hundred and fifty
unfortunate men; had witnessed,
also, the wretched end of the two
youths about to embark with the other
prisoners, and the noble death of
the courageous commissary of police,
shot down while he sought to protect
them from the vengeance of the volunteers,
whom their mad bravadoes,
as they were marched down to the
ship, had infuriated. In the course
of the week a colored man had been
killed in the streets for seditious cries,
and several others stabbed at night
by unknown hands. And as if to
keep up the constant anxiety and fear
that overcast Havana like a lurid
cloud, the Cubans by every possible
covert insult, and only just avoiding
the most terrible consequences, had
shown their hatred of their Spanish
rulers.</p>

<p>One trifling incident became a subject
of interest and excitement that
would have been absurd under any
other circumstances than the present.
On Good-Friday a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gorrion</i> (sparrow)
was found dead in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Plaza de Armas</i>
by a volunteer. Some say, though
others contradict the report, that the
poor little bird had its eyes torn out,
its heart transfixed with pins, and a
paper attached to one of its feet containing
the words, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Asi mueran todos
los gorriones</i>&mdash;"May all sparrows die
thus!" Now, it must be understood
that <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gorrion</i> is another of the appellations
bestowed on the Spaniards by
the Cubans. A few sparrows having
been brought from Europe to the island
by some ship-captain, they prospered
and multiplied in such a degree
that they soon outnumbered and domineered
over the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Bijirita</i>, a native
bird somewhat smaller, but much resembling
the sparrow in form, color,
and habits. An analogy being imagined
between the Spaniards and the
new-comer&mdash;the name of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gorrion</i> was
given to all the natives of the peninsula
of Spain, while the Cubans adopted
that of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Bijirita</i>.</p>

<p>The little dead <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gorrion</i> found on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Good-Friday was placed with much
ceremony in a glass coffin, and laid
in state in a room of one of the barracks,
on a lofty catafalque, with velvet
pall and lighted tapers and a guard
of honor. Crowns of fresh flowers,
and of red and yellow "everlastings,"
were suspended around and above
the remains of the typical bird, and
two exquisite nosegays, each more
than three feet high, and as much in
circumference, the gifts of the captain-general
and of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">generala</i> his wife,
stood one at the head, the other at
the foot of the mimic tomb. All the
volunteers paid their respects with
much ceremony to the little representative
of their race, and so many people
crowded to visit it on Holy-Saturday
that it was at last determined to
utilize public curiosity.</p>

<p>On Easter-Sunday every person who
wished to see the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gorrion</i> was obliged
to pay ten cents, which were to
go to the fund destined to aid the
volunteers disabled in the present
terrible struggle. On Easter morning
the sum received amounted to
three hundred and fifty-one dollars!</p>

<p>A great number of songs, sonnets,
and odes were composed in honor of
the poor little bird, and the manuscripts
were tied by colored ribbons
to the crowns suspended above it.
They have since been collected and
printed, and sold for the benefit of
the same fund. Many of them were
published in the <cite>Diario de la Marina</cite>,
the official daily paper of Havana.

<p>The gorrion was buried, and Havana
left once more without other
thought than that which had occupied
Spaniards and Cubans for the
several months previous. It is said
that in former days ships which approached
the tropic of Cancer, knew
when they were nearing the shores of
Cuba by the sweet odor of flowers
and honey borne to them on the
breeze; now, alas! the beautiful island
is recognized from afar rather by the
light of her burning plantations&mdash;by
the smell of gunpowder and of blood!
To all who have lived in Havana and
who have friends among both parties;
to all who know and appreciate the
proud sense of honor and unshrinking
courage of the one, and the quick
intelligence and high aspirations of
the other, the present struggle must
and does give the deepest pain.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>But while they sympathize sincerely
with those who sorrow, they believe
that "behind a frowning providence
God hides a smiling face,"
and that, the strife ended, Cuba will
rise again from her ashes, purified
and regenerated; for it is written
that "they who sow in tears shall
reap in joy"!</p>

<h2>MARY STUART.</h2>


<p>It is at once a remarkable fact and
a striking exemplification of the vitality
of poetic justice in history that,
from among modern Scotch Puritans,
from the spiritual descendants of John
Knox, should have come three of the
noblest and most effective modern vindications
of Mary Stuart.</p>

<p>We refer to the work by Mr. Hosack
noticed in our last number, to that
which we make the subject of the
present article,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and to the poem of
Bothwell,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> one of the finest in the
entire range of English literature.
Professor Aytoun's poem is accompanied
by a body of historical notes,
which are in themselves a model of
legal argument and dialectic power,
covering the entire period of the history
of Mary Stuart in Scotland. And
yet these three writers are very far
from being looked upon by their
countrymen as the holders of singular
opinions. It may be news to
many persons, but it is, nevertheless,
the fact that they merely reflect the
prevailing feeling in Scotland concerning
its unfortunate queen of three
centuries agone, murdered in an English
prison. The sentiment of the
great body of the Scotch people,
gentle and simple, Puritan and Catholic,
is to this day decidedly in her
favor, and the superficial reader who,
trusting to a superficial Froude, sneers
at Mary Stuart, is safer from reproof
in New York than in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Mr. Caird's work, of which the second
edition was published last year,
appears to be made up of the material
of a series of lectures delivered
by him in some of the Scotch
cities, and, like Mr. Hosack's work,
is marked with evidences of great research,
ability, and a thorough knowledge
of the country, the people, and
the times under discussion.</p>

<p>Like Mr. Hosack, Mr. Caird convicts
the late English historian, Froude,
of numerous disgraceful blunders, and
several&mdash;well we can find no term
properly to describe the performance
but&mdash;palpable falsehoods. Mr. Caird
does not undertake to write a full and
connected history of Mary Stuart or
of her reign in Scotland. He seeks
mainly to unravel the mystery of the
intrigues, plots, and conspirations by
which that unfortunate queen was
surrounded and pursued from the
moment she set foot in her kingdom.
And he does it successfully.
In all history, there is no record of
a band of greater villains than the
nobles who surrounded Mary's throne,
or of more devilish abettors than their
English allies. The time is not far
off when, in spite of falsified history,
Mary Stuart must be held innocent
of the crimes of which her very accusers
themselves were alone guilty.
Mr. Caird enters gracefully on his subject.
Three centuries ago, a French
fleet sailed up the Frith of Clyde, and
cast anchor at Dumbarton. It took
on board a little girl, six years of age&mdash;a
merry creature who had not a
care in the world&mdash;hoisted the flag
of Scotland, and bore her away to
the coast of France. There passed
with her in the same ship a stripling
of seventeen, her illegitimate brother,
(afterward known as the Earl of
Murray,) who, though incapable of
inheritance, was brought up in the
most intimate family intercourse with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
her; young enough to engage the sisterly
affection of her warm heart, old
enough to be already her trusted counsellor
and guide. His life was to be
a continued betrayal of her confidence.
But whatever wild thoughts may have
passed through his busy brain, neither
of them could have dreamed in those
early days of the frightful tragedies in
which they were to become the chief
actors. In the yet distant future he
was to usurp her place and power, she
to become his miserable prisoner; and
it was all to end at last in his being
shot down, without law, at the summit
of his greatness, and in her being
doomed to die, under the forms
of law, on an English scaffold. Yet,
though their hearts were light on this
summer voyage, it was not without
its dangers.</p>

<p>Twelve years later, a fleet sailed
from sunny France, again bearing
the same girl, now budding toward
womanhood. It steered for the Frith
of Forth. There is no laughter now.
Her first great sorrow has come
upon her early. She is deeply clothed
in mourning&mdash;a widow at eighteen.
Again an English fleet watched to
intercept her. Again she escaped
narrowly, losing one of her vessels.
She has been queen of France. One
blow has deprived her of a husband
and a crown. She claims to be queen
of England. That claim rests on
strong grounds of law. It is to be
the dream of her life, and she is never
to realize it. She is the acknowledged
queen of Scotland; but she lands on
her native shore with sad forebodings
and a heavy heart. No one has ever
charged her with having misconducted
herself before that time; yet such was
the distracted state of her country,
such the weakness of her authority,
that she said before she set out
on this voyage, "Perhaps it were
better for me to die than to live."</p>

<p>Less than six busy years of troubled
government and we see her again&mdash;on
the Frith of Solway. She has been
despoiled of her Scottish crown. She
is flying for her life in a fishing-boat.
"For ninety miles," she writes, "I
rode across the country without lighting
or drawing bridle; slept on the
bare floor; no food but oatmeal;
without the company of a female;
not daring to travel except by stealth
at night." And now the die is cast,
and, in spite of many warnings, she
this time throws herself on the generosity
of England.</p>

<p>Then follow nineteen years of bitter
captivity:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>At last we see a long hall in the old
castle of Fotheringay; a platform laid
with black&mdash;the actors and spectators
all clothed in black. There comes in,
unsupported, to die, a lady of noble
presence. She has been wickedly denied
the aid of her spiritual comforter,
and, alone with God, has administered
to herself the last sacrament of her
religion, without the blessing or counsel
of a minister. Even her latest moments
are disturbed by theological
dispute. But she is calm, and resigned
to God's will. She lays her head on
the block. The executioner strikes
and makes a ghastly wound. She
does not even stir. He strikes again,
but his work is incomplete; and with
a third blow the life and sorrows of
Mary Stuart are brought to an end.</p>

<p>It is one of the great problems of
history, says Mr. Caird, whether these
terrible calamities were brought upon
her by her own wickedness or by the
contrivance of others.</p>

<p>We have reason to believe that the
child is now living who, as man or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
woman, will hear and see the last
mention in history of <i>Good Queen
Bess</i>.</p>

<p>Of all the humbugs of history, the
reputation manufactured for Elizabeth,
the daughter of Henry VIII. and
Anne Boleyn, is at once the most insolent
and the most disgusting. We
do not care to give a personal opinion
of this woman, and will accept, for the
present, her character as mildly described
by the historian Robertson,
which is to the effect that she was
an habitual and mean liar, a peevish,
bad-tempered, vacillating, untrustworthy
sovereign, whose parsimony,
and variableness, and small economy
would have ruined herself and her
kingdom but for the fact that she
had a great statesman by her, and
that good luck continually picked her
out of the imbroglios into which she
had fallen. She was a vain, bad-tempered,
irresolute, deceitful old woman.
And this is as lenient a view of Elizabeth
as could be taken of her with the
historic lights possessed by Robertson.</p>

<p>But, compared with what we now
know her to have been from the results
of modern discoveries among official
and state paper records, Robertson
has here painted an angel of loveliness.</p>

<p>And just in proportion as Elizabeth
has fallen on the historic page, Mary
Stuart is elevated by every fresh discovery
of original documentary evidence.
She was, indeed, as Mr. Caird
writes, a winning, gentle-hearted woman,
and the correspondence of her
own time, before men's hearts were
hardened against her by passion, bears
much testimony to her virtues.</p>

<p>Throckmorton, the English ambassador
in France, even during her war
with England, wrote of "her great
wisdom for her years, her modesty,
her judgment in the wise handling of
herself and her matters." And another
of the English ambassadors, who
became one of her deadliest enemies,
says of her only a few months before
her grievous calamities were brought
upon her, "There is one cheer and
one countenance always on the queen."
Even after she was imprisoned in Lochleven,
Throckmorton wrote of her to
Elizabeth, "The lords speak of the
queen with respect and reverence."
Lord Scrope said, "She has an eloquent
tongue and a discreet head,
stout courage, and a liberal heart."
And Sir Francis Knollys reported of
her, "She desireth much to hear of
hardiness and valiancy, commending
by name all approved hardy men of
her country, although her enemies, and
she concealeth no cowardness, even
in her friends." Lethington wrote of
her soon after her return to Scotland,
"She doth declare a wisdom far exceeding
her age."</p>

<p>After she was uncrowned, Murray
and his council recorded of her, that
"God had endowed her with many
good and excellent gifts and virtues;"
and he spoke of her in the same way
in private.</p>

<p>The Earl of Shrewsbury, after having
had the custody of the Queen of
Scots during fifteen years of her imprisonment
in England, was consulted
by Elizabeth on the subject of a treaty
for her liberation. She desired especially
to know from him for her guidance,
whether Mary's promises could
be relied on if she were free. Shrewsbury's
answer was, "I believe that if
the Queen of Scots promises any
thing, she will not break her word."</p>

<p>Her frequent and earnest pleadings
with foreign powers for justice and
mercy to her subjects cannot be read
without interest and admiration. Her
letters have been gathered from every
corner of the earth, and every page
of them marks the elegance and simplicity
of her thoughts. If any man
who has a prejudice against her will
sit down and read that correspondence,
in which she treats of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
incidents of life, he will rise from the
perusal with a different notion, not of
her mind only, but her heart. These
are the records which we can read
now, exactly as they dropped from
her pen, untainted by the bitterness
of party, as so little else which concerns
her was permitted to be. And
we can see her there as she disclosed
herself to her most confidential friends,
whether in the highest business of state
or in the trivial affairs of daily life.</p>

<p>Mr. Caird's plan does not embrace
a connected narrative of Mary's reign,
and we regret that he has found it
necessary to omit a narrative of the
treacherous manner in which the destruction
of the Earl of Huntly was
brought about. On Mary's arrival
in Scotland, every one was surprised
that Mary should select for her chief
state councillor her half-brother, the
Lord James, instead of the Earl of
Huntly. No one knew that Mary
had been craftily persuaded by James
that Huntly was not loyal. The plan
of her brother was as wicked as it
was deep. It was at once to deprive
Mary of a loyal adviser and a powerful
friend, and to raise his own fortunes
on Huntly's ruin. It is curious
to see how all this affair is ingeniously
misrepresented by Mr. Froude in his
so-called history. Yielding to James's
solicitations, begun years before, Mary,
after creating him Earl of Mar, created
him Earl of Murray. But this
latter title he did not wish to assert
until he could obtain the lands appertaining
to the title, which he had
procured while living in ostensible
friendship with the man he had doomed
to ruin. The lands were in Huntly's
possession, and Murray made up
his mind to have them. "But Huntly,"
says Mr. Froude, "had refused to
part with them." Who was Huntly?
He was earl chancellor of the kingdom,
a man aged fifty-two, a powerful
Catholic nobleman, who could
bring twenty thousand spears into the
field. He had done good service for
Mary's mother against the English.
English gold had not stained his palm.
He was a man marked for saying that
he liked not the "manner of Henry
VIII.'s wooing." He had wanted
Mary to land at Aberdeen, was at the
head of the loyal party on Mary's arrival,
and had sought to warn her of
her brother's craft and ambition. Mr.
Froude thus describes him, (vol. vii. p.
454:)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Of all the reactionary noblemen in Scotland
the most powerful and dangerous<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> was
notoriously the Earl of Huntly. It was
Huntly who had proposed the landing at
Aberdeen. In his own house the chief of
the house of Gordon had never so much as
affected to comply with the change of religion,"
etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>What depravity! Would not change
his religion, nor even have the decency
<i>to affect to comply</i>! Positively an atrocious
character! Nevertheless, so perfect
is the command of a philosophical
historian over his feelings that these
dreadful facts are recorded without
comment. It is evident that the
lands of such a wretch as Huntly
ought to be given to one so "God-fearing"
as Murray. "A number of
causes combined at this moment to
draw attention to Huntly." But, all
counted, the number is just two&mdash;one
of them utterly frivolous, and the other,
"he had refused to give up the lands."
Mr. Froude is now candid, and tells
us that Murray "resolved to anticipate
attack, (none was dreamed of,)
to carry the queen with him to visit
the recusant lord in his own stronghold,
and either to drive him into a
premature rebellion or force him to
submit to the existing government."</p>

<p>"Murray's reasons for such a step,"
continues Mr. Froude, "are intelligible."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>Perfectly. "It is less easy,"
he continues, "to understand why
Mary Stuart consented to it." And
then Mr. Froude proceeds to wonder
over it with John Knox's guesses, and
his own "if," "perhaps," and "may
be." Less easy indeed! It is utterly impossible,
unless one consents to look
at Mary Stuart as she was&mdash;a young
woman easily influenced through her
affections, and with a sincere sisterly
attachment for the man in whom she
failed to recognize her worst enemy.
Difficult indeed to understand the
suicidal measure of ruining the most
powerful Catholic nobleman in Scotland,
and strengthening the hands of
the most powerful Protestant leader.
"Huntly's family," says Mr. Froude,
"affirmed that the trouble which happened
to the Gordons was for the sincere
and loyal affection which they
had to the queen's preservation," (vii.
456.) And they were right. We
leave Mr. Froude to speculate on the
malicious motive Mary Stuart must
have had for thus lopping off her right
hand. Murray now manages to draw
the queen and her attendants over
moor and mountain two hundred and
fifty miles to Tarnway, within the
lands of the earldom of Murray. She
was entirely guided by him, and he
used her authority to compass his personal
ends and weaken her throne.</p>

<p>Alexander Gordon at first refused
to open the gates of Inverness Castle
to the queen, but complied the next
day, on the order of Huntly. Murray
had Gordon immediately hung, and
his head set on the castle wall. Mr.
Froude describes this brutal murder
as "strangling a wolf-cub in the heart
of the den," (vol. vii. p. 457,) all that
Murray does being of course lovely.
Mary was now surrounded by Murray
and his friends, who poisoned her
mind against the Huntlys with stories
that the earl meant to force her into
a marriage with his son, and had other
designs against her person and royal
authority; and Mary believed them.
"Whereupon," writes Randolph to
Cecil&mdash;for Murray had brought his
English friend, Elizabeth's servant,
along with him&mdash;"whereupon there
was good pastime." Huntly yielded
all that was demanded of him. His
castles and houses were seized, plundered,
stripped, and he was a ruined
man. Lady Huntly spoke sad truth
when, leading Murray's messenger
into the chapel of the house, she said
to him before the altar, "Good friend,
you see here the envy that is borne
unto my husband; would he have
forsaken God and his religion, as those
that are now about the queen, my
husband would never have been put
as he now is," (vol. vii. p. 458.) Mr.
Froude reports this incident, and very
properly spoils its effect by the statement
that Lady Huntly was "reported
by the Protestants to be a witch."
Huntly was driven to take up arms.
"Swift as lightning," says Mr. Froude,
with yellow-cover tinge of phrase,
"Murray was on his track." And
now "swift as lightning"&mdash;sure sign
of mischief meant&mdash;Mr. Froude moves
on with his narrative, omitting essential
facts, but not omitting a characteristic
piece of handiwork. News
came from the south that Bothwell
had escaped out of Edinburgh Castle;
"not," glides in our philosophic historian&mdash;"not,
it was supposed, without
the queen's knowledge," (vol. vii. p.
459.) After a wonderful victory of
his two thousand men over Huntly's
five hundred&mdash;a mere slaughter&mdash;Murray
brought the queen certain
letters of the Earl of Sutherland,
found, he said, in the pockets of
the dead Earl of Huntly, and showing
treasonable correspondence. They
were forgeries; but they answered
his purpose. "Lord John, (Huntly's
son,) after a full confession, was beheaded
in the market-place at Aberdeen,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
(vol. vii. p. 459.) There was
no confession but that which <i>Murray
told the queen</i> he made, and Mr.
Froude forgets to tell us that Murray
caused young Gordon's scaffold to be
erected in front of the queen's lodging,
and had her placed in a chair of
state at an open window, deluding
her with some specious reason as to
the necessity of her presence.</p>

<p>When the noble young man was
brought out to die, Mary burst into a
flood of tears; and when the headsman
did his work, she swooned and was
borne off insensible. Here is Mr.
Froude's short version of these facts:
"Her brother read her a cruel lesson
by compelling her to be present at the
execution." Mr. Froude also forgets
to tell us that Murray had six gentlemen
of the house of Gordon hung at
Aberdeen on the same day. But a
few pages further on, he has the insolent
coolness to tell us of a prize
that Mary "trusted to have purchased
with Huntly's blood"! (vol. vii. p.
463.) After all, you thus perceive
that it was not Murray, but Mary,
who wrought all this ruin.</p>


<h3>THE RICCIO MURDER.</h3>

<p>Mr. Caird presents with great force
the result of modern discoveries in the
State Paper Office touching the details
of the Riccio conspiracy, and shows
conclusively that Murray was its real
head, and also the chief organ of communication
between the conspirators
and the English government. The
previous knowledge of the intent to
murder Riccio, and the probable danger
to Mary's life, is brought home to
Elizabeth. She could not have been
accounted guiltless, even if she had
remained passive, merely concealing
from her royal sister the bloody tragedy
which was being prepared for
her with the knowledge of her agent
in Scotland. This agent (Randolph)
she supported vehemently, protected
the assassins, negotiated and trafficked
until she got them restored, supplied
Murray with large sums of money
immediately before and immediately
after Riccio's death, and took the first
opportunity to gratify her vindictiveness
against Darnley by open insult.</p>

<p>In the conspiracy for the murder
of Riccio, no one was more deeply
implicated than Darnley. He had
allowed himself to be flattered and
tempted by Murray, Maitland, and
the rest with the prospect of a royal
crown. But while these crafty men
used him in this way for their own
ends, they had not the slightest idea
of allowing him to be more than a
puppet in their hands. The knowledge
of Darnley's complicity in the
murder had wrung Mary's heart; but
after the first burst of grief, she saw
clearly that he was the dupe and tool
of others. Her respect for him could
not be otherwise than shaken; but
her affection preserved him from the
punishment which he richly merited.
And for his sake she spared his father
(Lenox) also, whom she justly blamed
most; but she never permitted <em>him</em> to
enter her presence again. Considering
that she had released him from
the consequences of treason only
twelve months before, and that he
had now repeated the offence under
such aggravated circumstances, and
had beguiled his son into the same
evil course, bringing misery upon her
household, her forbearance can be attributed
only to surviving tenderness
for her husband.</p>

<p>Mr. Caird places in a very clear
light the development of the contempt
and hatred of the conspirators for
Darnley, which gradually hardened
and intensified into the conspiracy to
murder him; and as we watch its
growth, it is sad to witness the suffering,
sacrifices, and self-denial of a
noble-hearted woman all wasted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
vain, and upon a most unworthy
object. And yet more sad is it when
we see, in such falsifiers of history
as Mr. Froude, the very clearest and
highest proofs of womanly goodness
and wifely devotion wrenched and
perverted into evidence of crime and
murder.</p>

<p>In connection with this subject, Mr.
Caird draws attention to the record
of the Scotch Privy Council&mdash;an account
the more valuable because the
very men composing the council attempted
at a later period to cast discredit
on the queen. Here is their
testimony: "So far as things could
come to their knowledge, the king
(Darnley) had no ground of complaints;
but, on the contrary, that he
had reason to look upon himself as
one of the most fortunate princes in
Christendom, could he but know his
own happiness." And they added,
"That although they who did perpetrate
the murder of her faithful servant
had entered her chamber with
his knowledge, having followed him
close at the back, and had named
him the chief of their enterprise, yet
would she never accuse him thereof,
but did always excuse him, and willed
to appear as if she believed it not;
and so far was she from ministering
to him occasion of discontent, that,
on the contrary, he had all the reason
in the world to thank God for giving
him so wise and virtuous a person as
she had showed herself in all her actions."</p>

<p>There are few points in the history
of this period on which writers are so
thoroughly agreed as the utter worthlessness
and incapacity of Darnley,
and there are also few cases which so
completely as that of Darnley exemplify
the too common weakness of the
superior woman for the inferior man
who possesses her affection. Trafficking
on her affection, and seeking to
wring from her a consent to his demands,
he came very tardily to what
was by all supposed to be her dying-bed
at Jedburg. His bearing shocked
all beholders. It was at this time
Mary made her will, the inventory
attached to which is a modern discovery.
She left Darnley twenty-five
jewels of great value, and opposite one
cherished ring wrote with her own
hand, "It is the ring with which I
was betrothed. I leave it to the king
who gave it to me." And yet Mr.
James Anthony Froude informs us
that Mary was then planning this
husband's murder!</p>

<p>The most admirable chapters of
Mr. Caird's work are those which
treat of</p>


<h3>THE MURDER OF DARNLEY.</h3>

<p>The author shows conclusively, from
an array of original testimony which
cannot be disputed, the precise nature,
extent, and composition of the conspiracy
to effect this assassination, and
presents the whole question in an entirely
new light.</p>

<p>As revealed by Mr. Caird, the conspiracy,
by the time the moment was
reached for execution, had trebled itself.
That is to say, there were in
the field on the eventful night of the
murder, three separate and independent
bands of assassins, one of which
most certainly acted independently
of the other two. Bothwell and his
party, thrust forward to do the work
by associates quite as guilty as he, but
possessed of more brains, were, materially,
innocent of Darnley's killing,
although fully guilty in intent. They
blew up the house at Kirk o' Field,
supposing that Darnley went with it.
There can now be but little doubt
that when the explosion took place
Darnley was already a dead man,
smothered or <i>burked</i> by a special
band.</p>

<p>For some hours after the explosion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
no trace of Darnley's body could be
found; but as morning dawned, it was
discovered in a garden eighty yards
from the house. The attendant who
slept in the room with him was lying
dead at a short distance further away.
Each had on a night-shirt. There
was not a fracture, contusion, or livid
mark, nor any trace of fire on their
bodies, and the king's clothes were
lying folded beside him. A fur
pelisse, open as if dropped, was lying
near him. Now, if we are to suppose
that Darnley was blown up in the air,
we must believe it possible that a
human body could be thrown a distance
of eighty yards without any
marks of violence; that another body
was thrown the same distance with
the same results; and&mdash;stranger than
all&mdash;that Darnley's fur pelisse and
slippers were also blown uninjured to
his side by the explosion, while five
other inmates of the house were buried
in the ruins.</p>


<h3>ELIZABETH'S GUILTY KNOWLEDGE.</h3>

<p>One fact of equal importance and
interest is well established by modern
investigation. It is the guilty knowledge,
and actual or implied association
of Queen Elizabeth of England
in all the secret plots set on foot by
the nobility of Scotland against Mary
and her interests.</p>

<p>She was fully advised of the murder
of Riccio three weeks before it took
place, and Mr. Caird establishes, we
think, conclusively, that she was quite
as well advised concerning the Darnley
murder.</p>

<p>Fourteen years after the occurrence,
one of the first acts of King James, on
his freedom from tutelage, was to commit
the Earl of Morton to the Castle
of Edinburgh, charged with the murder
of Darnley.</p>

<p>Morton was one of the very few
surviving conspirators. Bothwell was
dead in exile; Maitland had poisoned
himself, and Murray had been shot
down in the streets of Linlithgow.</p>

<p>As soon as Queen Elizabeth heard
of Morton's arrest, she made the most
frantic efforts to prevent his trial. She
endeavored to stir up insurrection in
Scotland; she threatened war; she
moved an army to the frontier; she
sent back to Scotland as her ambassador,
Randolph, so thoroughly familiar
with all its murderous plots.
Leicester, her lover, wrote to Randolph
with a suggestion scantily veiled
that the young king might follow his
father&mdash;"He will not long tarry in that
soil. Let the fate of his predecessor
be his warning." And close on the
heels of that, came official notice that
Elizabeth would assist and maintain
the Scots in protection of Morton.
But James owed a debt to the memory
of his murdered father, to the
name of his captive mother, who was
then pining in her English prison, and,
in spite of Elizabeth's threats and violence,
Morton was brought to trial,
found guilty, and sentenced to death.
Mr. Caird cites and refers to a mass
of dispatches connected with Elizabeth's
movements in this Morton
matter which we have never seen
elsewhere alluded to, and adds Queen
Elizabeth's violence before Morton's
trial and execution was not more remarkable
than her sudden attitude of
acquiescence as soon as his mouth
was shut. "Did he hold some terrible
secret whose disclosure she feared?"</p>

<p>The murder of Darnley occurred
on the 10th of February, 1567. A
full fortnight before, Mary's ambassador
in Paris wrote to her that he had
received a hint from the Spanish ambassador
that the queen should take
heed to herself, for there was a plot
on foot to her injury. The letter
reached Mary twelve hours too late
to be of any service as a warning.
But even if she had received it, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
whom could she have turned for aid
or information? All the lords were
in the plot, and she was surrounded
by conspirators. The question is
asked, Why did she not bring to justice
the murderers of Darnley? Her
situation was such that it was simply
impossible for her to get at the knowledge
of any fact dangerous to the
conspirators. Denunciatory placards
were issued in Edinburgh. But if
shown, she would there find herself
charged with being an accomplice
with Bothwell and others in the murder.
Knowing this to be an outrageous
slander on herself, she would
naturally conclude that it was equally
so on them. And if herself innocent,
Bothwell was the very last of
her lords whom she could suspect of
having cause of quarrel with the king.
He was almost the only man who
had supported Darnley, and it is certain
he was not of those to whom
Darnley had demonstrated antipathy.
The wild scheme of ambition which
Bothwell afterward pursued had probably
not clearly developed itself even
in his own mind till after Darnley's
death. Dreams he may have had.
But the scheme which he finally executed
seems to have been the growth
of opportunity.</p>

<p>After the murder, Mary shut herself
up in a dark chamber, and kept
it until her physicians compelled her
to go to Seaton. A month after the
murder, when Killigrew, the English
ambassador, saw her, she was still in
a dark chamber, and seemed in profound
grief. Two such tragedies as
had befallen her within a twelve-month
were more than enough to
shatter the nerves of any woman.</p>

<p>And now came a fresh warning
from Paris that some new plot was in
progress. The Spanish ambassador,
by whom the warning of the Darnley
murder had been given, said,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Apprise her majesty that I am informed,
by the same means as I was before, that
there is still some notable enterprise in hand
against her, whereof I wish her to beware
in time."</p></blockquote>

<p>No explanation was given, and the
poor queen was of course bewildered.
She had heart and nerve enough
for her own risk; but she at once took
precautions for the safety of her child,
the heir to the crown. She at once
placed him in charge of the Earl of
Mar, and lodged him in the strong
castle of Stirling. And this fact is
more than answer to the assertion
that Mary was at this time under the
influence of Bothwell. If any such
influence had existed, he would not
have permitted the disposition that
was made of the child. His first effort
on coming to power was to get
the young prince into his hands. The
Earl of Mar justified Mary's confidence,
and withstood the efforts not
only of Bothwell, but of Murray, to
get possession of the child.</p>

<p>Then came the distribution of the
crown lands among the conspirators
by the ratification of parliament.</p>

<p>This matter was at once the main
cause of Darnley's murder and the
bond of union among the murderers.
On the evening of the adjournment
of parliament, its members were entertained
at a supper by Bothwell.
After the feast, a bond was produced
by Sir James Balfour, by which they
bound themselves to sustain Bothwell's
acquittal, recommended him as
the fittest husband for the queen, and
engaged to support him with their
whole power, and to hold as enemies
any who should presume to hinder
the marriage. They all signed but
one, the Earl of Eglinton. It was at
this time that Bothwell began to manifest
his intentions to Mary, and a
letter of hers relates that he tried "if
he might by humble suit purchase
our good-will, but found our answer
nothing correspondent to his desire."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Mary then went to Stirling to visit
her child. She probably wished, says
Mr. Caird, by leaving Edinburgh at
this juncture, to indicate to Bothwell
that her rejection of his approaches
was decisive; and he acted as if he
thought so. His next step was that
of a <i>desperate man</i>.</p>


<h3>BOTHWELL CARRIES OFF THE QUEEN.</h3>

<p>On her return from Stirling, three
days later, he suddenly met her on
the road with a large armed force,
seized her, made her escort prisoners,
and carried her off to his castle at
Dunbar. He kept her there for eleven
or twelve days. When she resisted
his insolence, he produced the
bond granted to him by the nobility,
and she there found the signatures
of every man from whom she could
have expected help. Not one moved
a finger in her defence. Huntly
and Lethington, who were there with
Bothwell, would not fail to remind
her of the calamities which she had
brought upon herself by opposing the
policy of her nobles in her former
marriage. Day after day she held
out, but no help came. Sir James
Melville, who had been taken prisoner
with her, records that such violence
was at last used that she no longer
had a choice. Bothwell, in his dying
confession, said that he accomplished
his purpose "by the use of sweet waters."
Morton's proclamations charged
him with using violence to the
queen, "and other more unleisum
means." It seems not unlikely, therefore,
that he employed some sweetened
potion. Mary herself says that
"in the end, when she saw no hope
to be ridd of him, never man in Scotland
ance making a mint for her deliverance,
she was driven to the conclusion,
from their hand-writes and
silence, that he had won them all."
He partly extorted and partly obtained
her consent to marriage. Bothwell
then conveyed the heart-broken
queen, surrounded by a great force,
to the Castle of Edinburgh. He next
carried her before the judges, after
lining the streets and crowding the
courts and passages with his armed
retainers. She there submitted to
make a declaration that she "forgave
him of all hatred conceived by her
for taking and imprisoning her;" and
also that she was now at liberty. The
necessity for such a declaration implies
previous coercion. Mr. Caird
explains that, under the then existing
law, Bothwell had committed an offence
punishable with death if he had
not obtained this declaration. A
marriage was formally solemnized,
and so little was her will consulted
that it was in the Protestant form.
Fettered by their bond, the nobles all
looked on and lent no aid. One honest
man there was, though, the Protestant
minister Craig, who boldly
told Bothwell that he objected to the
marriage because he (Bothwell) had
forced the queen. Called upon to
proclaim the banns, Craig denounced
it from the pulpit, and afterward publicly
testified in the next general assembly
that he was alone in opposing
the marriage, and that "the best
part of the realm did approve it, either
by flattery or by their silence."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Silver Casket Letters</span> are
treated by Mr. Caird as they must
be by every fair-minded man. He says,
"These letters, in truth, were as gross
and clumsy fabrications as ever were
put forward." His thorough analysis
of the longest letter&mdash;a love-letter
of fourteen quarto pages of print&mdash;is
the most successful we have seen.</p>

<p>Mr. Caird closes his work with two
scenes so effectively portrayed that
our readers will thank us for transcribing
them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After much earthly glory, and a long
reign, the time came at last when the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Queen Elizabeth must die. Wealth, grandeur,
power which none might question&mdash;all
were hers. But a cold hand was on her
heart. The shadow of death was creeping
over her&mdash;slow, very slow, but deepening
every hour. There was not one left who
loved her, or whom she could love. Her
most trusted servants trembled at her passions,
and longed for a change. Hume tells
us she rejected all consolation. She refused
food. She threw herself on the floor. She
remained sullen and immovable, feeding
her thoughts on her afflictions, and declaring
her existence an insufferable burden. Few
words she uttered, and they were all expressive
of some inward grief which she did
not reveal; but sighs and groans were the
chief vent of her despondency, which discovered
her sorrows without assuaging them.</p>

<p>"Oh! the long and unutterable agony of such
a time. What is there on earth that could
bribe one to bear it willingly? How bitterly
she must have realized the words addressed
to her by Mary Stuart on the eve
of her execution:</p>

<p>"'Think me not presumptuous, madam,
that now, bidding farewell to this world,
and preparing for a better, I remind you
that you also must die and account to God
for your stewardship as well as those who
have been sent before you. Your sister
and cousin, prisoner of wrong,'</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Marie R.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Ten days and nights Queen Elizabeth lay
thus upon the carpet; then her voice left
her, her senses failed, and so she died."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mary Stuart had gone long before,
destroyed and done to death by this
woman; sent to the scaffold in a land
where she had been wrongfully kept
a prisoner, to whose law she owed no
allegiance, and by virtue of a law
which was passed to compass her
death. On her way to execution, she
was met by her old servant, Andrew
Melville. He threw himself on his
knees before her, wringing his hands
in uncontrollable agony.</p>

<p>"Woe is me," he cried, "that it
should be my hard hap to carry back
such tidings to Scotland!"</p>

<p>"Weep not, Melville, my good and
faithful servant," she replied; "thou
shouldst rather rejoice to see the end
of the long troubles of Mary Stuart.
This world is vanity, and full of sorrows.
I am Catholic, thou Protestant;
but as there is but one Christ,
I charge thee in his name to bear
witness that I die firm in my religion.
Commend me to my dearest son.
May God forgive them that have
thirsted for my blood."</p>

<p>She then passed to the scaffold. She
surveyed it, the block, the axe, the
executioners, and spectators undauntedly
as she advanced. She prayed
to God to pardon her sins and forgive
her enemies.</p>

<p>The two executioners knelt and
prayed her forgiveness.</p>

<p>"I forgive you and all the world
with all my heart; for I hope this
death will give an end to all my troubles."
She then knelt down and commended
her spirit into God's hands,
and the executioners did their work.</p>

<p>The sad tale is told. All the actors
have been nearly three centuries in
their graves; but their story shall stir
the hearts of men till the world's end.</p>

<h2>A BRIDEMAID'S STORY.</h2>


<p>A bridemaid! I had become a
necessity. A sense of such importance
was novel to me. It was a
pleasant awakening to a consciousness
that I had attained womanhood.
To have been a bride would not have
filled me with such unmingled joy;
for then I might have been thinking
over the possibilities of the future.
Now I had only to play my part in
the bright and bewildering present.</p>

<p>That there had been bridemaids before
my time, of the loftiest and of
the lowliest degree, from the jewelled
princess to the humble dairy-maid,
rendered my position none the less
novel and refreshing. Then, too, the
circumstances of the case were not to
be lightly passed over&mdash;I had been
chosen from among so many whose
claims to consideration were far above
mine.</p>

<p>An imaginative child always seeks
and finds some object in which to
concentrate its thoughts and its loves;
something real to serve as an embodiment
of its ideal fancies. Hence, all
the wealth of my fervent nature had
centred on Marian Howard.</p>

<p>From earliest childhood I had
watched and wondered at her rare
and high-born beauty. Every feature
in her face seemed to have a distinct
and separate fascination, while every
adornment of dress that could enhance
her varied charms was brought into
requisition. To look upon her was a
feast of pleasure to my eyes.</p>

<p>The quiet dignity of her manner
kept a distance between us, so that
she was a sort of far-off idol, after all.
In her company we never gave way
to our outgushing school-girl nature.
I sometimes thought she would be
happier if she were only more like us,
or if we should welcome her with a
girl's free and fervent greeting. But
who dared try the experiment?</p>

<p>As we grew older, our paths in life
diverged. Soon after leaving school,
Marian went to live and to love in a
foreign land, while I returned to the
quiet pleasures of a rural home.</p>

<p>Four years passed, and then the
fine old house which had so long remained
silent again showed signs of
life. They had returned&mdash;the widowed
aunt and her beautiful niece.</p>

<p>The preparations for the wedding
were immediately commenced, and
Marian repaid my early devotion by
offering me the highest mark of her
confidence and regard.</p>

<p>The old tenderness came rushing
back when I again beheld her more
stately and more beautiful than ever.
She told me it would be a quiet wedding&mdash;only
a few friends, and I her
only bridemaid. My arrangements
were soon completed, and I awaited
anxiously the appointed time. Soon
it was the day before the marriage.
I went over to assist in the final preparations,
and was to spend the night
with Marian. The morrow would
witness, in the case of my friend, the
great event of a woman's life&mdash;to be
given away in marriage. I say of a
woman's life, because marriage can
hardly have the same significance for
men; they are not given away.</p>

<p>The distinguished stranger who was
so soon to call Marian his wife was certainly
unlike any of the men I had ever
known; but I had known so few, and
my knowledge of the world was so limited,
that I did not feel competent to
pass judgment on him. Then there
were such method, such calmness and
system about the man, about the unbending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
aunt, about Marian, and about
the whole house, that I felt cold with
a chilling sense of not being able to
get warm again, though it was a lovely
summer afternoon. More of nature
and less of art, I thought, might
have warmed the approaching festivities.</p>

<p>The evening shadows were falling.
We had just finished arranging and
rearranging the costly bridal gifts,
when Marian was summoned to attend
her aunt.</p>

<p>Among the other presents was that
grand conception, Gustave DorÃ©'s
<cite>Wandering Jew</cite>. This work of human
genius seemed a strange companion
for the rare articles of luxury
that surrounded it.</p>

<p>I took up the book and went out
upon the balcony. The softly-fading
twilight, the subdued spirit of the
house, the reflective turn my own
mind had taken, prepared me for impressions
of the awful and sublime.</p>

<p>It is said that "real genius always
rises, and in rising it finds God."
Surely the force and truth of this
thought were here exemplified; for
who could look upon these scenes, so
truthful and intense, without a feeling
of awe and reverence?</p>

<p>I was thus occupied, I know not
how long, when suddenly Mr. Gaston
recalled me to myself. "How absorbed
you are, Miss Heartly! I have
been watching you with much interest.
Pray, has the book any bearing upon
the coming events of to-morrow?
Court beauties, I suppose," he continued
carelessly, as he came toward
me.</p>

<p>"Why!" said I, "you have returned
early, Mr. Gaston. You cannot
have taken that delightful drive Marian
proposed to you?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "I have no
inclination for solitude; but you ladies
are so occupied with these time-killing
nothings, these endless little arrangements
so indispensable to your
happiness, that we lonely mortals are
entirely ignored and forgotten."</p>

<p>"I think, sir, that calamity seldom
befalls you," I replied, thus adding,
perhaps, to vanity already sufficiently
great.</p>

<p>"But the book?" he continued,
opening it listlessly. "Oh! the old
fable in a new dress. It is strange
how women cling to the marvellous
and impossible. They seem to have
but two absorbing ideas&mdash;love and religion.
Extremes in either usually
lead to the same pernicious result. I
suppose an idol is a necessity to them,
and it matters little in which they
find it."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," I replied.
"Are you in jest, or are you
seriously denouncing revealed religion?"</p>

<p>"Revealed religion!" he repeated.
"Is it possible that, at this stage of
the world's advancement, <em>you</em> still
cling to that antiquated idea of Christianity?"</p>

<p>The modern methods of fashioning
a god to suit the impious desires of vain
and conceited mortals was then unknown
to me. I looked at the man with
wonder and distrust. He read my confusion
and hastened to explain himself.</p>

<p>"Religion," he said, "as you accept
it, makes us cowards instead of
men. My reason is <em>my</em> religion; I acknowledge
no other guide."</p>

<p>"Ah! then," I exclaimed, "how
often must you stumble by the way."
I turned to the most effective picture
in the book. "Here is an instance
of the vanity of human pride. Here
we can see the end of man's boasted
strength&mdash;the anguish of a lost soul
hopelessly looking for repose and
peace."</p>

<p>"An imposing fable," he replied,
"wanting only a woman's faith to
give it substance and reality."</p>

<p>I was rising to put an end to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
unprofitable and distasteful conversation,
when Marian joined us. My
disturbed manner plainly annoyed
her, and she evidently suspected its
cause; for she addressed Mr. Gaston
in German quite earnestly. Soon turning
to me he said, "Pray, excuse me,
Miss Heartly; I was not aware that
you were a Catholic. I know your
people feel most keenly what they
profess. Of course you have already
stamped me a condemned heretic."</p>

<p>"It is not for me to pass judgment
on you," I replied; "and if I did, my
opinion could be of very little value."</p>

<p>"Come, come!" said Marian, "this
is a most unapt and gloomy subject for
my marriage eve; and the sun, too,
has gone down sullenly. I hope
there is nothing prophetic in all this."</p>

<p>"What! growing serious now?" I
said, as I drew her arm within mine,
and we went to look for the fiftieth
time at the final arrangements for the
morrow's festivities.</p>

<p>I could not, however, throw off the
feeling of uneasiness that my interview
with Mr. Gaston had left. He had a
way of cheapening one, so that, without
knowing why, you fell immeasurably
in your own estimation. This
is never a comfortable condition to
find one's self in, and it takes a good
deal of nice logic to bring one back
to one's normal state.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the loftiness of his
style that awed me; for he had a
magnificent way of carelessly throwing
the world behind him and walking
forth in a sort of solitary dignity.
"His manners are courtly," Marian's
aunt said, and certainly they possessed
all the cold stiffness that characterized
her particular circle; still, I felt
I had no real grounds for this feeling
of distrust and aversion to Mr. Gaston,
and I began to think it was rather ungenerous
to hold him in so unfavorable
a light. I could not shake off, however,
an undefined dread of the approaching
marriage. The apathy and indifference
which had always been peculiar
to my young friend did not forsake
her even now, when apparently on
the very threshold of happiness. I
thought that intensity of feeling perhaps
kept her thus silent, for overpowering
happiness has this effect
sometimes. The delusion was, however,
speedily dispelled.</p>

<p>That night a sealed chapter in Marian's
life was laid open to me, and I
saw her as I had never seen or thought
of her before.</p>

<p>After locking the chamber-door,
she seated herself by my side, and
said, "This is the first time in my
life that I have known perfect freedom;
I mean a liberty to do and say
what I like with a feeling of security.</p>

<p>"You remember the 'Greek Slave.'
Well, I am not unlike that delicate
girl chained in the market-place. Every
inclination of my heart has been
chained down and locked, and my
aunt has kept the key.</p>

<p>"I was an uncomplaining, passionless
child. In my cradle I received
my first lessons in self-control. As I
grew older, I learned another lesson,
too unnatural for even a thoughtful
child like me to understand. I was
not needed here; I was considered
only as a desirable ornament for this
great house. I might as well have
been placed upon a pinnacle and petrified
at once, for all the childhood
that was allowed to take root within
me.</p>

<p>"My aunt's domestic misfortunes
had embittered her, and she had no
children to soften the natural austerity
of her soul. My mother, who was
her only sister, had, contrary to my
aunt's wishes, married where her heart
inclined. This was never forgiven or
forgotten until she lay dead, and I
was a wailing infant at her side.</p>

<p>"My father soon afterward perished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
at sea, and my aunt took me to her
home.</p>

<p>"She was not designedly cruel; but
she knew nothing of a child's requirements.
The freezing system seemed
to her the most effectual method of
crushing out a young, impulsive nature.
There was danger I might become
rebellious, and hence she required
the utmost meekness and submission.</p>

<p>"As soon as I came to understand
the power of beauty, I saw that it
was to mine I owed food and raiment;
for it fed the exhaustless vanity
of my aunt, with whom display was
then, and still is, the moving spring of
her existence.</p>

<p>"I was a drawing-room child, kept
for exhibition at stated intervals. The
tiny jewels on my neck and arms
were hateful to me. My embroidered
robe was a costly thing. I had
given a young life for it.</p>

<p>"I had a mortal fear of losing my
beauty. Our gardener's daughter&mdash;a
comely, cheerful-looking girl, whom I
was always glad to see, for she made
the morning brighter with her fresh
young face&mdash;had caught that loathsome
disease, the small-pox. When
she recovered, the change that had
come upon her so terrified me, that
I was seized with a sensation as of
coming danger. I shrank from the
girl, as if she would be the cause of
some future misery to me.</p>

<p>"She had a mother to whom she
seemed infinitely more dear now than
she had ever been. But I, a lonely
waif, what would become of me if I
should be transformed like her?</p>

<p>"It was not altogether for my own
gratification that I desired to retain
this beauty. It was not my own beauty.
It belonged to my aunt, and
was all I had to give her in return for
what she gave me.</p>

<p>"I was not a child that saw angels
in the skies, or that expected manna
to come down from heaven to feed
me.</p>

<p>"Artificial and unsatisfying as my
life has always been, I have a clinging
desire to remain with it.</p>

<p>"At times I have had a vaguely
conceived notion of one day getting
away from it and of being free; but
the bending and breaking system has
so subdued me that I might lose myself
if left to the guidance of my own
free-will.</p>

<p>"Marriage is a solemn thing.
Would you like to change places with
me to-night, Mary?"</p>

<p>I could not say yes, and I dared
not say no; for I saw that she was
losing courage, and beginning to hesitate
about the important event so
soon to transpire.</p>

<p>"That is a strange question, Marian
dear," I replied. "To-morrow
ought to be, and I hope will be, the
happiest day of your life. Surely you
must love this man when you have
promised to be his wife?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," said she, "as well as I
understand what it is to love. I sometimes
tremble for fear I have not the
qualities that make woman lovable
and attractive. You forget how little
I know of Edward Gaston.</p>

<p>"Our acquaintance began in a little
German town, where he was stopping,
for the purpose of establishing
his claims to a disputed inheritance.
He is an American by birth and education.
He soon became a constant
visitor with us. My aunt and he were
on the best of terms. My own interest
in him had never passed beyond
the civilities of an ordinary acquaintance
until he again joined us at Naples,
where he lost no time in making
known the state of his feelings.</p>

<p>"My aunt seemed to have had
some previous knowledge of his preference;
but its announcement was to
me a complete surprise.</p>

<p>"She was proud of her nice discrimination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
in the selection of her
friends, and Mr. Gaston had come
into our circle labelled and indorsed
a gentleman.</p>

<p>"Her gracious consideration, however,
of his offer, in no wise obscured
her caution. Satisfied as to his
worldly affairs, and well assured of
his position at home, there was nothing
wanting but my consent, which
was really the most trifling part of the
arrangement. I accepted this marriage
engagement as I would have
accepted any other condition so mapped
out for me.</p>

<p>"Business of a pressing nature
which could be delayed no longer,
called Mr. Gaston to America, and I
did not see him again until our return
a month ago.</p>

<p>"You see how little I know of
him. Can you wonder that I am
constrained in his presence? Of
course, every thing will be different
when I come to know him better.</p>

<p>"But I have one cause of feverish
anxiety. I am not above the petty
subterfuges almost incidental to a life
like mine. A desire to hide mistakes
committed through childish ignorance
made me unscrupulous, as any
member of a household who is watched
and suspected must naturally be.
Habit may have made these little
irregularities almost a second nature,
but my blood recoils from a wilful and
deliberate deception. I am afraid
Edward is misled with regard to my
aunt's pecuniary condition.</p>

<p>"This life of seeming affluence,
which has become as necessary to her
as the air she breathes, drains heavily
on her slender resources. Such portion
of her time as is not spent in her
handsome carriage, or in drawing-room
entertainments, is passed in a
most frugal and even parsimonious
mode of living, and it is only by an
economy painful to contemplate that
she has kept things floating thus far.</p>

<p>"I cannot acquaint Edward with
my aunt's existing embarrassments.
She is my only kinswoman; and
misguided as she is, I have a tender
affection for her. I hope to be able
to offer her a home with us, when, as
soon must be the case, the last act in
this miserable farce shall have been
played.</p>

<p>"Now, perhaps, you can understand
why I thus passively submit to
a marriage that I would turn from if
I could. I cannot openly say to Mr.
Gaston, 'I have no fortune, I hope
you expect none;' even to covertly
approach the subject would be to impugn
his motives, and I certainly have
no right to suspect him of harboring
mercenary ones. Still, I wish he
were acquainted with the truth; for
the world, you know, looks upon me
as sole heiress of my rich aunt.</p>

<p>"I have no knowledge of what
passed between Edward and my aunt
at Naples, when our marriage was
agreed upon; but I have a constant
dread least he may have been deceived.
I once mentioned to him, in conversation,
that he would claim a portionless
bride; but he seemed to take
no notice of what I said, and I fear
he still thinks my aunt's circumstances
to be in reality what they seem."</p>

<p>"In giving way," I replied, "to
such groundless fears, dear Marian,
you underrate your own worth. Think
how many noble and honorable men
would be proud to call you wife, and
in giving you a life of happiness make
amends for the past." Yet as I looked
in the silver starlight upon that lovely
face, which had so attracted me in my
childhood, I could not but regret
deeply and sadly that she was not of
my faith; for then she might receive
wiser counsel than I could give from
one of those whom Christ in his mercy
has ordained to be a guide and a staff
to weak and wavering souls.</p>

<p>The wedding breakfast was all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
even Marian's fastidious aunt could
have desired. The few favored guests
were of the most approved type. It
would seem as if a judicious instructor
had given each of them a select number
of words, which they used with
exemplary caution, and then retired to
the contemplation of their own individual
greatness.</p>

<p>As to Marian, the despondency of
the night before had quite left her,
and there was a high and noble resolve
in her manner that made me
truly happy to behold, while it calmed,
if it did not entirely dispel, my
own gloomy forebodings. The serene
expression of her sweet face would
have drawn me nearer to her, if that
were possible.</p>

<p>How I loved her, as she stood before
me, beautiful in the purity of her
white robe, and infinitely more beautiful
in the chastened security of her
firm and lofty purpose&mdash;to be a true
and honorable wife to Edward Gaston;
to meet the conditions of her new
life, whatever they might be, with a
woman's trust and confidence, and
better still, with a woman's hope in the
never-failing reward of duty faithfully
performed.</p>

<p>I could have been positively gay
through desire to sustain Marian, and
to let her know, without telling her in
words, how thoroughly I appreciated
and how heartily I approved her noble
intentions, her courage and confidence;
but as measured words and
actions alone were allowed, I had to
restrain myself. Still, the cooling
process did not diminish my ardor,
and when I got Marian all to myself,
in her room, I kissed her so approvingly,
and was so extravagant in the
expression of all that I felt, that she
folded me with loving tenderness to
her breast, and kept me there so long
that I felt with the quick beating of
her warm heart she was giving me
some of her own newly-found courage.</p>

<p>"Whatever happens to me, Mary
dear, in the extremity of any darkness
that may come upon me, I shall always
know that you are true to me,
that you are still my friend."</p>

<p>The tears that fell upon her hand
as she gently raised my head, were
my only answer, and she accepted
them in the spirit in which they were
shed.</p>

<p>In returning to my ordinary duties,
I had much to reflect upon, much
that made me still uneasy for Marian
and her future, where so many doubts
and fears seemed hanging on the will
of one human being.</p>

<p>Vague rumors of Mr. Gaston had
reached us, that he was a man wholly
without fortune, drifting on the surface
of events; darker things, too, were
whispered with an indirectness which
gave them an uncertain coloring. In
my love for Marian, and in my fear
for her, I could not credit these suspicions;
yet my anxiety to again see her,
and discover for myself the truth or
fallacy of these reports, was intense.
Indeed, my state of anxious doubt
was becoming intolerable when I received
a letter from Marian, telling
me she was already tired of travelling,
and would return soon to make a last
visit to her old home before leaving
for her future and distant one.</p>

<p>It was agreed that they should
spend the day after their arrival with
us. I was so happy and so occupied
in preparing for their reception, that
I had almost forgotten my previous
anxiety in my present desire to have
every thing ready and in perfect order.</p>

<p>The pleasure I felt in the prospect
of having my darling with me so
soon was dreadfully toned down by
the consciousness of my own inability
to satisfy her aunt's critical taste. I
trembled as I thought of her scrutinizing
glance; but I had a never-failing
source of hope in my mother.
Her good-natured hospitality was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
such a melting kind that I dared hope
that even the rigid aunt might thaw
under it, which she really did, greatly
to my relief and comfort.</p>

<p>The dinner passed off creditably.
My tranquillity was now entirely restored,
and I had time to devote to
Marian.</p>

<p>Up to this moment I had viewed
her through the medium of my excited
condition; now I was calmed, and,
so far as the affairs of the day went,
contented.</p>

<p>Marian's manner was restless and
uneasy. My perception was keenly
alive to the slightest difference between
what she did and said now and
to what she did and said formerly. So
solicitous was I, that I think the most
trifling modulation in her voice had
a significance for me.</p>

<p>Much as I had looked forward to
this reunion, much as I had desired
it, now that Marian was with me, I
shrank from being alone with her. I
think if we had been that summer
evening even in the solitude of a
mountain fastness, an intuitive delicacy
would have kept both of us from
speaking one word upon the only
subject that filled our hearts.</p>

<p>My mother's humanizing influence
was having its effect on the stately
old lady. She was captured without
knowing it. Mr. Gaston had gone
out for a walk; so Marian and I were
left alone. I tried to talk about her
new home, and repeated some things
Mr. Gaston had told me before the
wedding.</p>

<p>"Edward has changed his mind,"
said Marian, "and has found it necessary
to make some different arrangements;
so I really cannot tell much
about our home. It is very far
away; don't you think so, Mary?"
I saw that her feelings were beginning
to get the upper hand, and I did not
dare trust myself to reply. I turned
from her immediately on the pretext
of having forgotten some household
duty. She strolled out to the garden
in a spiritless way.</p>

<p>Every thing was revolving itself in
my mind, and I was beginning to reproach
myself; perhaps if I had encouraged
her to speak, it might have
lifted the load from her heart; another
opportunity might not be permitted
us; and yet, bowed down as the poor
girl was, it would not have raised her
in my esteem had she even with me
disparaged her husband. To cover
him with a wife's forbearance was
now one of her hard but imperative
duties, and I knew she would not
shrink from it. This must be a check
to our confidence, a bridge over
which my kindliest sympathy must
never pass.</p>

<p>Unmistakable evidences of a storm
close at hand made me run to the
arbor where I had last seen Marian.
She was not there. While deliberating
where I should next go, I
heard Mr. Gaston's impatient tread.
He stopped by a clump of trees near
me, and in tones of suppressed anger
commenced upbraiding his defenceless
wife.</p>

<p>"What did you mean by suggesting
such a thing as that?" he began;
"have you any right to dispense hospitalities,
to propose or consider them
in that grand style of yours?"</p>

<p>"In expressing the wish," replied
Marian, "that my aunt would be able
to spend the winter with us, I had no
intention of doing any thing beyond
a natural act of gratitude; and I was
not aware, Edward, that your feelings
had so changed toward her. I am
sure she has done nothing to merit
your displeasure."</p>

<p>"Nothing to merit my displeasure?
You are a most creditable disciple!
She has made you like herself, truly.
Is it nothing in your eyes that she has
always lived a life of nicely-arranged
deception? Your accomplished aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
has conducted a forlorn hope with a
woman's tact, and the victims of her
trickery are expected to bow to her
superior sagacity. In a burst of universal
sympathy you propose to take
this wreck of decayed grandeur to
my house. This was a part of the
plot, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Edward," interrupted Marian,
"how dare you speak in this way
of my aunt, who has shown you so
many marks of sincere regard? That
she has not husbanded her resources,
I grant; but that misfortune rests entirely
with her, she is the only sufferer.
She made you no promises, gave
you no reason to expect a fortune
with me; this I have learned since
our marriage. Have no fear of the
incumbrance. Dear as she is to me,
I would rather let her beg from door
to door than see her a recipient of
your bounty!"</p>

<p>"Oh! you are proud now," he replied
in a voice of withering scorn.
"Take care," he continued; "you
have not seen the end yet. Make
yourself ready to depart. I want to
leave this house instantly."</p>

<p>"Edward," she said, "however you
choose to afflict me, whatever tortures
you have in store for me, do not, I
beseech you, subject me just yet to
the pity of those I love, of those who
love me. These people are my truest
friends. I would not make them
sharers of my misery. Spare me a
little longer."</p>

<p>"Your fine speeches and these people
are alike objects of indifference to
me. Make yourself ready; I am going."</p>

<p>She made a movement to obey
him; but turning round again, she
said, "Edward"&mdash;the voice and tone
I shall never forget; it was as if all
she had ever valued in life had whispered
a last farewell&mdash;"Edward, as I
had hoped to give you a wife's unfailing
duty, to be trustful, loving, and
true; so I had hoped you would give
me a husband's protection, and perhaps
a husband's love."</p>

<p>"I am not fond of scenes," he interrupted;
"your requirements are of
so nice and delicate a nature that I
would be quite incapable of gratifying
them; so I shall not trouble myself
to make the attempt; and for the future,
spare yourself any unnecessary
display of sentiment."</p>

<p>I could not have left the arbor
without being seen. Marian passed
by slowly, not to the house, but in an
opposite direction, and Mr. Gaston
started for the lower end of the garden.
I caught a glimpse of him as
he turned an angle of the walk. A
wicked look had settled on his handsome
face, as if dark spirits were urging
him on.</p>

<p>A peal of thunder, prolonged and
terrible, startled me. I ran to the
house. The lightning was truly awful,
and peal following peal of thunder
made one shudder and long for
human companionship. I had lost
Marian in the gloom and darkness.
She was not in the house; I did not
see her in the garden. I went out
into the storm in search of her.</p>

<p>I found her standing quite alone in
sad and listless silence. Can it be, I
thought, that death has no terrors for
one so gifted and so young? She
seemed imploring that doom which
the most abject and miserable would
flee from if they could. I knew then,
as well as I knew afterward, that she
would have welcomed death that
night without one single regret.</p>

<p>"Marian, dear," I said, approaching
her, "how can you remain alone,
and exposed in this manner, when
every thing about you is quaking with
fear?"</p>

<p>"I do not heed the storm," she answered;
"I like it, it is so wonderful."</p>

<p>"Come, come, darling! Why, the
rain has drenched you," I replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
putting my arm about her and leading
her to the house.</p>

<p>The storm had set in furiously.
There was no leaving the house that
night. I resolved that Marian should
sleep with me; so I went to Mr. Gaston
and told him I regretted our limited
accommodations obliged me to offer
him a temporary bed in the parlor.</p>

<p>When I told Marian of this arrangement,
she seemed relieved. "I am
glad to spend the night here and with
you, Mary," she said. "All is so
quiet and peaceful."</p>

<p>Quiet and peaceful! The greater
storm in her own breast made her forget
the contending elements without.</p>

<p>My aversion to Mr. Gaston was, I
believe, heartily reciprocated, and he
must have chafed at my influence
over Marian. He took her away
from her home, never to return, on
the very next day. They sailed for
Cuba shortly afterward.</p>

<p>The crisis Marian had feared for
her aunt soon came, and she went,
with the remnant of her fortune, to
live in some western town.</p>

<p>Seven years had rolled by since all
this, and Marian was fast passing into
the shadows we like to call up when
the world is hushed around us and,
we are thinking&mdash;thinking.</p>

<p>I was married, and laughing children
were crowding out these earlier
remembrances.</p>

<p>An affection of the throat, from
which my husband was suffering, rendered
the best medical advice necessary.
I accompanied him to New York,
where I found&mdash;let me pause
in telling it, to do reverence to the
unseen hand that led me there&mdash;Marian.</p>

<p>In this lonely stranger how little
do I behold of my childhood's earliest
pride!</p>

<p>"From Clifton?" said the physician
thoughtfully, after examining my
husband's case. "I have a patient,
a strange case; she is paralyzed, and
her mental faculties are stunned. A
Cuban family brought her here and
placed her under my care. Her husband
had committed a forgery, and
had fled the country to escape arrest.
She is an accomplished lady, I should
judge. She was left in Havana quite
poor and friendless. I have been led
to speak to you about her because
she is always writing two words&mdash;Mary
and Clifton. The Spanish lady
who brought her here knew nothing
of her former history."</p>

<p>I was silent during this recital, and
so white that the doctor offered me
water. I thanked him, and expressed
a wish to go to my friend immediately.</p>

<p>"I cannot return to the hospital
this morning," he said; "but I will
give you my card, which will admit
you to the lady at once."</p>

<p>There I found her, a silent, faded
figure, sitting still, and for all purposes
of life quite dead.</p>

<p>I was awed as I stood before her.
I sat down and took her poor, neglected
hand in mine. She looked
at me and made a feeble attempt to
gather back her hair which had fallen
in great disorder about her shoulders.
I rose to do this for her. It was still
glossy and beautiful as ever. I began
to arrange it in the fashion she
had worn it seven years before. She
took my hand from her head, laid it
in her lap, chafed it, then reverently
raised it to her lips. I could restrain
my tears no longer, and I hid my face
in the folds of her faded dress. She
turned me toward her and wiped the
tears from my cheek.</p>

<p>"You are going home with me,
Marian darling," I said; "to live always
in our own old home."</p>

<p>"I know it," she whispered; "I
have been waiting for you so long,
so very long."</p>

<p>This was the first time she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
spoken to me. The nurse had told
me that she spoke occasionally, but
always in an absent and incoherent
manner.</p>

<p>Sea-bathing was recommended;
but the doctor was of the opinion
that her mind would never recover its
original vigor.</p>

<p>I would like him to see her as she
left me this morning, calm and beautiful,
when the bell of the convent,
where she is teaching German, summoned
attendance.</p>

<p>My religion is no longer strange to
her. She has accepted it as the
crowning blessing of her life, and
with a thankful spirit she speaks of
the chastening hand that led her to
this security and peace.</p>

<h2>MR. GLADSTONE AND THE IRISH FARMERS.</h2>


<p>The long-expected bill for the settlement
of the land question in Ireland
was introduced into the British
Parliament a short time ago by Mr.
Gladstone in an explanatory speech
of rare perspicuity and methodical
statement. So fascinating, indeed, is
the premier's eloquence, so candid his
confessions of the injustice of English
law as at present existing in Ireland,
and of the baleful consequences which
have flowed from its operations in
the agricultural interests of the people
of the sister island, that for the time
we forget how far short are the measures
he now proposes, in the form of
an act of parliament, of the necessities
of the case before him, and to which
all his logic, rhetoric, and pathos form
but the graceful prelude. Turning
from the speech and carefully looking
over the sixty-eight clauses of the
proposed act, we are forcibly struck
by the inadequacy of the proposed
remedy for the terrible and manifold
evils which have so long afflicted the
tillers of Irish soil; and if, as Mr. Gladstone
asserts, his object is not only to
do justice to this long-oppressed people,
but to silence for ever the clamors
and pacify at once the almost
chronic discontent of the country, it
requires very little acumen to foresee
that his scheme, even if not modified
for the worse in its passage through
either house, will be a failure, particularly
as regards the latter results.</p>

<p>The head of the British cabinet, with
all that ability and knowledge of public
affairs which justly entitle him to
be ranked foremost among living English
statesmen, seems to have failed
alike to comprehend the magnitude
of the abuses he would correct and to
appreciate the wishes and expectations
of the great majority of the Irish people.
Whether through that obliquity
of mental vision which has always
characterized English public men
when attempting to deal with Irish
grievances, or from a dread of failure
if he attempted to inaugurate a more
radical change in the present relations
between landlord and tenant&mdash;and
from a remark in his late speech, the
latter cause would seem to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
most probable&mdash;he has been led
into a course of policy which, while
gaining him no allies in the opposition
ranks, will undoubtedly lessen
his influence with a large portion of
the liberal party in both kingdoms.
"By fixity of tenure," says Dr. Taylor,
"is now clearly understood, in
Ireland, that the right of the tenant
to his land is to continue as long as
the rent is paid, and that the rent
is to be adjusted at fixed periods, according
to the average price of produce;"
a statement fully indorsed by
the Irish press and reiterated by the
people at their recent numerous public
meetings. But the present bill contemplates
no such thing, either in expression
or by implication; and lest it
might so be understood, the premier
in his speech devoted much of his
time to demonstrate the fallacy and
danger of such doctrines.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As I understand it," he says, "the thing
itself amounts to this&mdash;that every occupier,
as long as he pays the rent that he is now
paying, or a rent to be fixed by a public tribunal
of valuation, is to be assured, for himself
and his heirs, an occupation of the land
that he holds without limit of time, subject
only to this condition, that with a variation
in the value of produce&mdash;somewhat in the
nature of the commutation of title act&mdash;the
rent may vary somewhat slightly and at
somewhat distant periods. The effect of
that is that the landlord would become a pensioner
and rent-charger upon his own estate.
The legislature has a perfect right to reduce
him to that condition, giving him proper
compensation for any loss he may sustain
in money; the state has a perfect right to
deal with his social status, and to reduce
him to that condition, if it thinks fit. But
then it is bound not to think fit unless it
can be shown that this is for the public good.
Now, is it for the public good that the landlords
of Ireland, in a body, should be reduced
by an act of parliament to the condition,
practically, of fund-holders, entitled to apply
on a certain day from year to year for a
certain sum of money, but entitled to nothing
more? Are you prepared to denude
them of their interest in the land? Are you
prepared to absolve them from their duties
with regard to the land? I for one confess
that I am not; nor is that the sentiment
of my colleagues."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here then is the issue at once raised,
and as Mr. Gladstone's views will receive
the sanction of Parliament, we
apprehend that the proposed act, no
matter how impartially executed, will
fail to satisfy the popular wants in
Ireland. It cannot be denied that
the great underlying principle of the
tenant-right agitation is the conviction
among the masses of the farmers and
peasants of that country that the soil
whereon they expend their labor, that
others may reap the profits, was and
is rightfully their own; that it was
forcibly and treacherously wrested
from their ancestors by a foreign
and hostile faction, whose descendants
now claim to possess it, and
who wring from them the fruits of
their toil, justly belonging to the cultivators
and their families. They do
not, however, desire a reconfiscation
of this property; but they do demand
a guarantee from the laws, under which
they are content to live, that as long
as they pay a fair rent they shall not
be disturbed in their holdings. The
question of leases for a term of years
and compensation for improvements,
though very important in itself, is
merely secondary to fixity of tenure.
That once guaranteed, in the Irish
and not in Mr. Gladstone's sense, the
impetus which would be given to the
farming industry of the country would
be so great that time and economy
only would be required to establish a
large class of small land <em>owners</em> in fee,
thus virtually undoing the spoliations
of former days, and dividing up the
large estates now devoted principally
to pleasure or pasturage, and held by
a few persons who neither reside in,
know, or care for the nation from
which they draw such exorbitant
rents. The entire land of Ireland
consists of nearly sixteen million acres
of arable land, and five millions more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
susceptible of cultivation, owned absolutely
by less than six thousand persons,
thus giving to each proprietary
an average of thirty-five hundred acres,
independent of mountain, bog, and
riparian lands, all more or less useful
for the sustenance of human life.
Then the majority of those owners,
including the representatives of the
very large estates almost without exception,
are absentees who in the aggregate
draw from the soil an annual
revenue estimated at forty millions of
dollars; not a tithe of it is ever returned
to the country in any manner,
except in the form of receipts. We
find that the tenants from whom this
large foreign tribute is exacted number
over six hundred thousand heads
of families, representing at least three
and a half million of souls, only one
in thirty of whom holds a lease of any
sort, the remainder being entirely dependent
politically and socially on the
will of the landlord, or his agents and
bailiffs. This anomalous state of affairs
in a country supposed to be at
least comparatively free is heightened
by the fact that the views and aims
of the landlord class and those of
the tenantry, which ought to coincide
on all matters affecting the national
good, are decidedly the reverse of
each other. As a whole, the religion,
politics, and traditions of the owners
of the soil have always placed them
in opposition to their tenants and dependents;
so firmly, indeed, that even
the demands of patriotism and the
allurements of pecuniary gain, powerful
for most men, have failed to swerve
the Irish landlord from his blind and
bigoted purpose of repressing the
laudable enterprise, and of ignoring
the commonest rights, of the people
from whom he derives his wealth and
position. In countries like Belgium,
Scotland, or Switzerland, where manufactures
are encouraged and capital is
abundant, this slavish relationship between
landlord and tenant would be
a secondary grievance; but in Ireland,
which is essentially an agricultural
country, the enormity of the evil cannot
well be over-estimated. "About
two thirds of the population of England,"
said the late W. Smith O'Brien,
"are dependent on manufactures and
commerce, directly or indirectly. In
this country (Ireland) about nine
tenths of the population are dependent
on agriculture, directly or indirectly."
"An ancient vassal," said
Van Raumer, a distinguished German
traveller, who some years ago
visited Ireland, "is a lord compared
with the present tenant at will, to
whom the law affords no defence;"
and a recent decision in chancery
declares that "if a tenant holding
from year to year makes permanent
improvements in the lands which he
holds, this raises no equity as against
the landlord, though he may have
looked on and not have given any
warning to the tenant."</p>

<p>But we have a more recent authority
on the condition of the Irish farmers
of to-day in the person of the special
commissioner of the <cite>London Times</cite>,
who certainly cannot be accused of
over-partiality in describing the condition
of that much oppressed class.
Writing from Mullingar under date
September 14th, 1869, he says, "By
far the largest portion of the country
is still occupied by small farmers, who
legally are merely tenants at will,
though they have added much to the
value of the soil by building, draining,
fencing, and tillage, and though they
have purchased their interests in numerous
instances, and it is probable
they will long maintain their ground,
though the area they hold is being
diminished. The existing law is not
a rule of right to this body of men in
their actual position; it exposes what
in truth is their property, the benefits
they have added to the land, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
confiscated by a summary process;
it sets at naught the equitable right
acquired by a transfer for value with
the assent of the landlord." From
Cork, after a month's further investigation,
he again writes, "As for the
landed system of the country as a
whole, it is, in its broadest outlines,
essentially the same as that which I
have so often described, except that
its vices are very prominent. Speaking
generally, the same religious differences
divide the owner and the occupier
of the soil; the absenteeism is
too prevalent; there is the same wide-spread
insecurity of tenure; the law
in the same way upholds the power
of the landlord, and disregards the
just claims of the tenant; there is the
same creation of vast rights of property
in the form of improvements, by
the peasantry, unprotected by the least
legal sanction, and liable, nay, exposed
to confiscation; vague usage similarly
is the only safeguard against frequent
and intolerable injustice." Conceding
to Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues
the greatest honesty of intention
in the introduction of the
present bill, and aware of the powerful
and not over-scrupulous opposition
which any remedial measure advocated
by them must encounter from the
tory and landed classes, yet in view
of such patent abuses as stated, as
well as from the assurances of Mr.
Bright and others&mdash;supposed to be
in the confidence of the ministry,
we had a right to expect a measure
more general, emphatic, and sweeping
in its reforms. Still, as the bill will be
passed substantially as presented, with
perhaps the addition of a few unimportant
amendments likely to be offered
by the Irish members, it is important
to examine in detail its main
features as far as they relate to what
is defined in the preamble as "security
of tenure."</p>

<p>The first subdivision of the bill provides
for the loaning of public moneys
to landlords and tenants on the following
conditions: Where the landlord
is willing to sell and the tenant to
purchase a particular farm, then in his
actual occupancy, at a price agreed
upon between the parties, the government
will advance the tenant the necessary
funds; and when the landlord
is only willing to part with his estate
in bulk, the actual occupiers of four
fifths, and any person or persons not
occupiers joined with them, may become
purchasers of the whole, and
a similar advance will be made. In
other words, the government takes
the place of the selling landlord, pays
him indirectly the price agreed upon,
and reimburses itself by annual instalments
from the tenant, now become
the owner, until the entire purchase
money is paid off. This seems
favorable enough for the enterprising
tenant, and to any other than Irish
landlords would offer strong inducements
to dispose of a portion, at least,
of their unwieldy and often heavily
encumbered estates, and would promote
the multiplication of moderate
sized and better cultivated farms; but
as we are aware of the hostility of
that unpatriotic class to every thing
tending to the elevation of their tenantry
to a position of comparative
equality, we have little hope of the
efficacy of this provision. Indeed,
Mr. Gladstone seems also of this
opinion; for in his late speech in
allusion to the subject, he says, "I
myself have not been one of those
who have been disposed to take the
most sanguine view of the extent to
which a provision of that kind would
operate." Purchasers of reclaimed
land not occupied are to have the
same privileges as occupiers of cultivated
lands. The landlord likewise
is to have his share of the public
money for the purpose of reclaiming
waste lands adjoining his estate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in some instances, for paying off the
compensation claims of his out-going
tenant. All these loans, securities,
repayments, and annuities are to be
under the direction of the Irish Board
of Works at Dublin.</p>

<p>The legal machinery for carrying
these and subsequent clauses of the
bill into effect will consist of two
classes of courts. One of arbitration,
consisting of appointees of the parties
interested, whose decision shall have
all the force of law, and from which
there shall be no appeal. The other
will be a regular court of law, with
very extensive equity jurisdiction, composed,
in the first instance, of a civil
bill court, presided over by an assistant
barrister of sessions; an appeal
court, composed of two judges of assize,
who may reserve important cases
for trial before the court for land
cess in Dublin. Taking into consideration
the relative wealth and personal
influence of the parties litigant,
we might hope for a less expensive
and complicated mode of procedure;
but as the law's delays are still as proverbial
on the other side of the Atlantic
as on this, it is perhaps the
least objectionable plan that could be
devised. Much certainly will depend
on the independence and humanity
of the courts; for while they will be
bound by the principles laid down in
the bill, it is authorized&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On hearing of any dispute between landlord
and tenant in respect of compensation
under this act, either party may make any
claim, urge any objection to the claims of
the other, or plead any set-off such party
may see fit, and the court shall take into
consideration any such claim, objection, or
set-off, and also any such default or unreasonable
conduct of either party as may appear
to the court to affect any matter in dispute
between the parties," etc., and give
judgment on the equities of the same.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bill then proceeds to secure
and define the tenure of all holders
of agricultural land, dividing them
into four classes: holders by the custom
of Ulster, by customs analogous
to that of Ulster in the other provinces,
tenants from year to year and at will,
and lease-holders generally.</p>

<p>The custom of Ulster, derived
strangely enough from the terms of
James I.'s charter to the undertakers
in 1613,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> as well as from traditional
usage, consists mainly of the right of
the out-going tenant to compensation
from his landlord for all permanent
improvements he may have made on
the land, or that he has actually paid
for to his predecessor, whether with or
without the consent of his landlord;
or the tenant may elect to sell the
same with his good-will of the farm
to the best purchaser. This custom,
covering about a moiety of the
3,400,000 acres of Ulster, is to be formally
recognized as law only in that
portion of the country, and in each
individual case where it now actually
exists. But when "the landlord has,
by a deliberate and formal arrangement
with an occupier, bought up
the Ulster tenant right, it shall not be
pleaded against him;" and where the
tenant has so sold to the landlord or
to the incoming tenant his right, he
shall be debarred from all other compensation
under the act. The value
of this custom, though heretofore only
partially recognized, will be perceived
from the fact that, though Ulster is by
no means the most fertile section, the
average annual value of its lands is
from four to four and a half dollars
per acre greater than the other portions
of the country. Why this custom,
so manifestly beneficial to all
classes, should only be made general
in Ulster, but not throughout the island,
it is difficult to determine.</p>

<p>There are also customs in other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>parts of the country which have become
traditional, and are said to resemble
somewhat that of Ulster; but
to what extent they prevail, or of their
exact nature, we are not informed.
They are commonly supposed to include
the right of compensation for
improvements of a certain sort, and
the sale of the good-will by the out-going
tenant. These, however, are
not regarded with the same degree
of fairness; for they can only be pleaded
when the landlord by his own act
severs the relation between himself
and tenant; and when pleaded, all
arrears of rent or damages to the farm
may be claimed as an off-set; they
are forfeited by ejectment for non-payment
of rent, or by sub-letting or
subdividing the holding, and are extinguished
by the acceptance of a
lease of thirty-one years or upward.
This is the first attempt we notice in
the bill to induce the landlords to
grant leases, and we regret to find
that throughout its entire length, with
the exception of one clause, there is
nothing at all prohibitory in its provisions.
What good reason can exist
for the preservation of the custom of
Ulster under a lease, while those of
the other three sections are bartered
away for that privilege? Is this not
another evidence of the partiality of
a reform which should be as comprehensive
as the evils to be eradicated
are wide-spread?</p>

<p>The most important part of the bill
is that which relates to the yearly tenant
and tenant at will; for it affects
by far the largest and most defenceless
class of Irish farmers. Out of
six hundred thousand heads of families
who derive their existence directly from
the soil, five hundred and eighty thousand,
or nearly ninety-seven per centum
of the whole, are of this class, and
are liable at any time to be thrown
on the charity of the world by the
edict of a landlord or his agent, deprived
not only of their sole means
of livelihood, but of whatever benefits
they may have conferred on their
little holdings by their hard labor and
well-earned money. It is useless now
to dwell on the horrible calamities
which have resulted from the wholesale
evictions of these unfortunate
people, or on what famine, pestilence,
death, and too frequently agrarian
crime, have year after year flowed
from the uncontrolled barbarities practised
on them by Irish landlords, armed
with the terrors of law. The wailings
and maledictions of the homeless
and expatriated have so long resounded
through both hemispheres, that
their very echoes have startled the ears
of their persecutors into something
like attention. "We have," says Mr.
Gladstone from his place in the House
of Commons, "simplified the law
against him, [the tenant,] and made
ejectment cheap and easy."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> This
large class, therefore, if not receiving
that adequate protection to which
they are justly entitled, will, under the
operation of the proposed act, have
their interests placed beyond jeopardy
in such a manner as, compared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>with their present practical outlawry,
will commend Mr. Gladstone to
their gratitude. Having no custom
to plead, and consequently very little
probability of obtaining leases, the
landlord can still eject them; but he
must do so on a year's notice, duly
stamped and dated from the previous
gale day, and for proper cause, such
as non-payment of rent or the refusal
of the tenant to accept another holding
equal in value to the one desired
by the landlord. If the landlord acts
without such cause, the tenant will
be entitled to damages against him
at the discretion of the court, exclusive
of compensation for improvements
and reclamation of land. The
maximum measure of damages for
wanton ejectment is set down in the
bill as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Damages for ejectment" width="80%">
<tr><td class="tdl">Holdings valued at</td><td class="tdl">Â£10</td><td class="tdr" width="20%">7 years' rent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Holdings valued at</td><td class="tdl">Â£10 to Â£50</td><td class="tdr">5 years' rent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Holdings valued at</td><td class="tdl">Â£50 to Â£100</td><td class="tdr">3 years' rent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Holdings valued at</td><td class="tdl">Â£100 and upward</td><td class="tdr">2 years' rent.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In any case the tenant upon ejectment
will be entitled to compensation
for improvements, from which
arrears of rent may be deducted. It
is the wise and beneficent intent of
the bill to place this helpless class
under the special protection of the
court, and make it the object of large
equity jurisdiction conferred; and it
even holds out a release to the landlord
of these penalties, providing he
gives to his yearly tenant a lease of
at least twenty-one years' duration.</p>

<p>The regulation of the tenure of
lease-holders generally is most judicious,
and the only compulsory one in
the bill. In future all leases shall be
submitted to, and the terms, as regards
rents and covenants, approved by, the
court, before their validity will be
recognized. Heretofore, Irish leases
have been made exclusively for the
benefit of one party, and the ingenuity
of the lower grade of the legal profession
seems to have been taxed to
the utmost to devise restrictions on
husbandry. We have copies of several
of those instruments of recent execution
before us, and they certainly
smack more of the pre-<i>magna-charta</i>
era than of the present enlightened
century. A petition presented to the
House of Commons at its last session,
from the inhabitants of the parish of
Clonard, county of Meath, set forth
that tenants there "are charged with
a penalty of Â£5 for every tree, and
every perch of hedge cut, injured, or
destroyed;" they are to break no land
without permission of the landlord,
and even then only such land and in
such manner as the landlord specified;
a fine of Â£10 is exacted for "each
acre or part of acre assigned, let, underlet,
or let in con-acre or otherwise,
or meadowed without formal written
permission;" they are not to remove or
cause to be removed any top-dressing,
compost, or manure of any sort, nor
any hay, straw, corn in the straw,
holm, or fodder of any sort, nor any
turnips, mangel-wurzel, or other green
crop of any kind, under penalty of
Â£5 per load or part of load; and the
top-dressing, manure, etc., are to remain
on the land at the termination of
the tenancy, and are to be the property
of the landlord. The Earl of Leitrim,
a very large landed proprietor
in the north, probably not considering
the above restrictions sufficiently
onerous, has had inserted in his numerous
leases clauses whereby the tenants
are required to preserve his fish
and game; and without his permission
in writing they are not to make any
new roads, fences, or drains, nor to
build up or alter houses or buildings,
nor to grow two white grain crops in
succession, nor to have beyond a certain
maximum of tillage, nor to break
up permanent grass-fields, nor to set
potatoes where there has been grass
the year before,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> nor to cut turf, etc.;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>and to surrender their leases at <em>any
time</em> at six months' notice, or in
case any of them be imprisoned by
any civil or criminal process for a
term exceeding fourteen days! But
Edward Henry Cooper, who is supposed
sometimes to honor Markie Castle
with his presence, requires not only
the observance of all the above conditions
on the part of his serfs, but binds
them to become informers and prosecutors
in their <em>own names</em> against
any poachers who may be found in
the leaseholds; and they are also to
<i>procure evidence</i> (how is not stated)
against their neighbors who might
kill a hare or spear a salmon on their
premises. The farmers who have the
happiness of living under this philanthropist
are required "to submit all
disputes and differences touching trespass
or measuring to, and abide by
the final award of"&mdash;Edward Henry
Cooper or his agents; a very impartial
tribunal, no doubt! The above
extracts may be taken as specimens
of the restrictions which surround even
the most favored class of Irish farmers
of the present day, and which, being
made with all the forms of law, backed
by the certainty of the strict enforcement
of the penalties, must have
a direct and ruinous tendency to check
improvement and limit the scope of
improved cultivation of lands.</p>

<p>The term improvements, so frequently
met with in the bill, is defined to
mean such as are suitable to the character
of the holding and add to its
letting value, such as buildings, reclaimed
land, manures, and tillage,
and the old rule of law, which presumed
all improvements made by the
landlord unless proved to the contrary,
is reversed in favor of the tenant.
No existing improvement will be paid
for if not made within twenty years
previous to the passage of the act,
except permanent buildings and reclaimed
land, nor where by the terms
of a lease the holder agreed to make
the improvements at his own expense.
In the future no claim will be allowed
for improvements made contrary
to the terms of the letting, or for such
as are not required for the due cultivation
of the farm, nor when the
landlord agrees to make them and
does not neglect to do so, nor where
the tenant, as part of the consideration
of the lease, agrees to do them
at his own charge. But whatever
the tenant pays to the out-going tenant
for compensation, with the sanction
of his landlord, he shall be reimbursed
on the termination of his
tenancy.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, is an outline of the
law under which the farmers of Ireland
will have to live for some years
to come. Although not all they demand
and have a right to expect, it
is nevertheless a great improvement
on the present system, if system it may
be called, under which they have so
long tried to exist. Whatever is valuable
in the local customs will be substantially
preserved and legalized; the
tenant will have some remote prospect
of becoming a purchaser, and the
tenant at will, a leaseholder. Compensation
for improvements is guaranteed
to every one capable of paying his
rent, and the luxury of evictions, if not
destroyed, is made an expensive one
for landlords. We cannot expect
that this measure, if passed in its best
form, will wholly stop agitation in
Ireland, but we trust and believe that
it will largely conduce to the wealth
and industry of her people.</p>

<h2>THE ASSOCIATION FOR BEFRIENDING CHILDREN.</h2>


<p>A new association has entered the
field of charitable labor in this city
bearing the modest title at the head
of this article. It has been organized
and is recommended to the public by
ladies whose names are a guarantee
of its success. The sphere of its charitable
work is among poor children
of degraded parents. It is not known,
except to the few practical workers
among the poor, that there exists in
New York a pauper class nearly if
not quite as destitute and degraded
as that which is found in the great
capitals of Europe. There are persons
here who are born in this lowest social
stratum, and will never rise from
it without help. Their lives begin,
are passed, and end in what seems to be
hopeless degradation. The portions of
the city where this class of its population
will be found are those bordering
on the rivers, on either side, extending
as far north as Fifty-ninth
street. Children born in this class inherit
the vices and diseases of their
parents, as well as their poverty.
They exhibit a precocity in debauchery
which no one can appreciate
who has not been brought into contact
with them. They inhale with
their first respiration a fetid atmosphere.
They have an instinct for
vice and crime. Many of them escape
the penalties of the criminal
code simply because they are so young
that the law overlooks them. They
come into the world with the child's
instinct to look to its parent as the
source of authority, and a model for
imitation. This authority is, for the
most part, exerted to compel the commission
of offences, and the model is
a finished example for the grossest
sins. With such influences from without,
coÃ¶perating with natural and inherited
tendencies to vice, it is easy
to see with what fearful rapidity the
child will be driven along in evil courses.
If education begins, as is claimed,
with the first outcry of the infant, what
a training is inaugurated here!</p>

<p>There is another class of our population,
not strictly a pauper class, but
which is raised but little above it. The
persons who compose it earn a scanty
living by fitful labor, and are exposed
to all the temptations which beset
extreme poverty. They easily fall into
vicious habits, squander their earnings,
and their children are left without
care, to subsist as best they may.
These children, equally with those of
the class still lower, are in need of
every thing which a judicious charity
can supply. The section of the
city where more of these little outcasts,
and their wretched parents, may
be found than in any other of equal dimensions,
is that bounded by Bank
street on the south, Sixteenth or Seventeenth
street on the north, the Ninth
avenue and the river. Out of this section
St. Bernard's parish has been carved,
and it was here that, a few
months ago, the small beginning was
made from which the new organization
has sprung. On the seventh day of
September last, a few ladies met at St.
Bernard's church, to open an industrial
school for girls. Notice that the
school would be commenced on that
day had been given in the church on
the Sunday preceding. No children
came at the hour named, and the ladies,
with one of the priests of the
parish, went out into the lanes and
alleys to compel them to come in.
About twenty-five girls were gathered
in the large upper room in the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
edifice during the forenoon. They
presented a pitiful spectacle of extreme
poverty and degradation. They
were clad in filthy rags, and, young as
they were, the faces of many of them
bore traces of a course of vice and
crime in which sad progress had already
been made. It was clear from
this first day's experiment that there
was an instant and urgent duty to be
performed, in reaching and reclaiming
children of this class. The ladies,
therefore, resolved to hold the school
on Tuesday and Friday mornings in
each week, from ten to twelve o'clock.
The large room in the church was
placed at their disposal. On the second
school-day, fifty girls attended,
and the number soon reached one
hundred. The character and magnitude
of the work which these ladies
had, almost unconsciously, undertaken
began to dawn on them. The
school had filled up with hardly any
effort on their part. The children
were in need of every thing. They
must be clothed and fed. They must
be gently led away from evil practices
and taught the very alphabet of
new and better lives. A few dollars
were collected at once and materials
for clothing purchased. Garments
were cut out, and the children soon
taught to assist in making them, and
the articles were distributed as they
were needed. This has been continued
until every child who has attended
the school has received a complete
outfit, including a new pair of shoes.
But the girls came hungry as well,
and must be fed. At the close of the
school on each day, a substantial meal
was served; and on Thanksgiving and
Christmas days, generous dinners were
given to two hundred children, for
which turkeys in abundance were provided.
The first step in any efficient
charitable work among the destitute
is, of course, to provide for physical
wants. We must begin with the body.
"First the natural," and "afterward that
which is spiritual," is the divine order.
The soul is to be reached through the
body, or rather, so closely united are
the two, that they are both acted upon
by the care bestowed upon either.
The normal cravings of the body,
when unsatisfied, become diseased and
the fruitful source of vicious indulgences.
The hunger which demands
but cannot get proper food, will demand
and get sustenance hurtful to
body and soul. The little child who
leaves a miserable shelter in the morning,
cold and hungry, will spend the
first penny bestowed in charity by a
careless giver at a rum-hole made
familiar by errands for liquor at the
command of a drunken parent, where
even a penny will buy what, for the
moment, answers for both food and
clothing. Little girls of twelve, and
even younger, have come to this school
in the morning whose only breakfast
has been the liquor which they could
buy for a cent, and who had already
contracted intemperate habits.</p>

<p>With children of this class, then,
the first step toward moral improvement
is the self-respect which they
put on with their first warm, clean
dress, and the satisfaction which follows
a meal of wholesome food. This
first step, however, leads to the next,
direct religious instruction; the "line
upon line and precept upon precept"
by which the child's soul is to be instructed
and purified.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that
these children are virtually heathen
in the midst of a Christian civilization.
They have received little or
no religious instruction. They are
the offspring of parents who, for the
most part, are Catholics in name,
but who have long since lost grace
and abandoned the sacraments of the
church. And yet they readily take
religious impressions, and are not
without those first Christian ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
which expand rapidly with patient
teaching. It has been the practice
at the school to spend a little time
each morning in instructing the girls
in the catechism; in repeating appropriate
verses of Scripture, in committing
simple hymns to memory and
singing them in unison. The ladies
who opened, and have conducted this
school for the past six months, have
not been discouraged because they
have not already achieved magnificent
results. They knew when they
began that the salvation of these children,
for this world and the next, was
to be "worked out;" that moral improvement
comes by "little and little;"
that no sincere charitable effort
is ever lost; that nothing can be lost
but opportunities; and that even a
cup of cold water given to one of
these little ones will not fail, either of
its reward or of its effect for good.
So far from being discouraged, what
has already been accomplished with
limited means and in a casual way
has far exceeded their expectations.
The work has been growing under
their hands from the start. The little
company of ragged girls, who came
reluctantly the first morning, has expanded
into a school numbering one
hundred and fifty, who are eager for
the instruction offered to them. They
manifest the utmost affection for their
teachers. They show signs of improvement
in every way. Many of
them give unmistakable evidence of
having commenced a new and useful
career. One girl who was found wandering
in the street on the first day
was asked by one of the ladies if she
ever went to mass; she said "No."
"Why not?" said the lady. She replied
with a bold stare, "Oh! I am a <em>bad</em>
girl." On being told by the lady that
she did not believe she was so bad,
the girl replied, her eyes filling with
tears, "Well, I <em>would</em> go if I had
any thing to wear but these rags; but
we've been awfully knocked about
since father died, and mother says
we're all going to hell, soul and body."
This Maggie is now one of the best
and brightest in the school, and an
efficient assistant of the teachers. Others
are emulating her example. In
fact, so much has already been done,
that the ladies who commenced are
irresistibly committed to a more efficient
prosecution of the work. They
see in it possibilities for good which
do not allow them to stop short of
the more thorough organization which
they have attempted in forming "The
Association for Befriending Children."
They feel that a necessity is laid upon
them to make secure the good already
attained, and that they would be recreant
to their duty as Christians if
they did not go on to the more perfect
results plainly within their reach.
The necessity of such an organized
charity has been shown in the rough
outline which has been given above
of the destitution of these children.
Notwithstanding all the charitable
associations for children, under the
names of "Industrial Schools," "Protectories,"
"Orphan Asylums," etc.,
there are at least twenty thousand
children in the city outside of any
such institution, whose necessities are
even greater than those within them.
In its circular the association says
that it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"does not intend to relieve parents from
their just responsibility for their children,
simply because they are poor. The possession
of children, and the duty of maintaining
them, are conducive among many
parents, contending with extreme poverty,
to habits of industry and sobriety. But any
one who knows even a little of the very degraded
portion of our population, is aware
that there are multitudes of children in this
city utterly abandoned by their parents, and
exposed to every form of vice, or rather
who are actually being trained, by precept
and example, in habits of debauchery. Such
children the association desires to bring under
the influence of daily instruction, to minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
to their daily necessities, to educate
them for useful employments."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such, then, in brief, are the aims of
this association.</p>

<p>The first step toward realizing them
has already been taken. Aided by
the liberality of a few gentlemen, the
association has rented the building
No. 316 West Fourteenth street, which
is admirably adapted to the purposes
of a home for those who may be received
as inmates, for a longer or
shorter term, combined with a day-school
for others. There is room for
fifty of these inmates, and for at least
three hundred more day-scholars.
The house is under the charge of a
matron and assistants in every way
fitted to care for, control, and teach
the children, who find their highest
reward in this opportunity to rescue
and elevate these little girls. The
new and most important feature of
this charity is that it combines an asylum,
a protectory, an industrial school,
and common school in one institution.
It encircles in its arms those
who are so low that they are overlooked
by all other charities. It finds,
after all, that "the ninety and nine"
have gone astray, and it seeks to bring
them back to the fold. It completely
removes from evil influences those
who are most exposed, and shelters
and fosters them till new habits are
formed, and seeds of good are implanted
and germinate. It gives to
all food and clothing. It instructs
all in the rudiments of knowledge.
It gives the girls such industrial instruction
as will enable them to enter
on the various employments which
society offers to their sex. Such a
home-school the association plants in
the midst of these utterly necessitous
children. There should be one or
more of them established in every
parish in the city; and if the Christian
liberality of Catholics be not
found wanting, such a result will be
accomplished. At present the association
must be sustained in the immediate
attempt which has been made.
Responsibilities have been assumed
which must be met by generous donations.
Surely the ladies who are
willing to give their best energies to
this glorious work, as well as their
portion of the money needed, will
not appeal to the public in vain.</p>

<h2>FRA BERNARDINO OCHINO.</h2>


<p>The blessed Bernardine, the glory
of Sienna and of the Franciscan order,
had a sad counterpart in him who
forms the subject of this sketch. Fra
Bernardino Ochino, one of the conspicuous
scandals of the sixteenth
century, was a son of Domenico
Tommassino, of Sienna. He received
his surname from the Via del Oca,
which contained the residence of his
obscure parents. Having taken the
habit of the Observantines, he left
his convent to study medicine at Perugia.
He there formed a friendship
with Giulio de' Medici, afterwards
Clement VII. Returning to his order,
he received successive places of
dignity; but whether dissatisfied with
these, or really seeking a more perfect
life, he again left it to embrace the
austere rule of the Capuchins, then
for the first time established in Sienna.
Few details remain of this portion of
the life of Ochino, and historians differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
in explaining the motives of this
change. Whatever they might have
been, it is certain that his fame as a
preacher was acquired shortly after
his entrance in the Capuchin order.
His reputation grew daily. The
most exacting critics gave him unqualified
praise. Sadoletus ranked
him with the greatest orators of antiquity.
The Bishop of Fossombrone
addressed him the most flattering
sonnets, and Charles V. was heard to
exclaim that the spirit and unction of
Fra Bernardino could melt the very
stones. The over-fastidious Bembo
had said of the preachers of his day,
"Why should I go to listen to their
sermons? One hears nothing but
the subtle doctor disputing with the
angelic, and, finally, Aristotle called in
to settle the question."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ochino stood even
the test of Bembo's criticism. For
the latter wrote from Venice to the
Marquis of Pescara, April 23d, 1536:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I send inclosed to your illustrious lordship
the letters of our reverend Fra Bernardino,
whom I have heard with inexpressible
pleasure during the too short period of this
Lent."</p></blockquote>

<p>To the parish priest he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Do not neglect to force Fra Bernardino
to eat meat. For, unless he suspend his
Lenten abstinence, he cannot resist the fatigue
of preaching."</p></blockquote>

<p>This last remark of Bembo reveals
to us something of Ochino's way of
life at that time. He had, indeed,
adopted those severe austerities which,
according to the unanimous doctrine
of the saints, though often the means
of advancement in the supernatural
life, yet, when undertaken or persevered
in from an ill-advised spirit,
generally lead to ruin, and become at
once food and clothing for the most
diabolical pride. The famous preacher
travelled always on foot, bare-headed
and unshod. He slept at
night beneath the trees that grew on
the wayside, or, if under the roof of
some noble host, on the pavement of
the guest's chamber. As he begged
from door to door, in the crowded
cities, the throng knelt, awed by his
wan features and fiery eye, and the
thin emaciated frame, which seemed
barely to support the coarse brown
habit of his order. At the tables of
the nobility he did not vary the least
detail of his penitential abstinence,
eating from only one dish, and never
even tasting wine.</p>

<p>When he preached, says a contemporary,
the churches could not contain
his hearers, and a great crowd
followed him wherever he went. Nor
was his preaching without fruit. The
infamous Aretino either underwent or
feigned a conversion, and wrote to
the pope, at the instance of Ochino,
begging pardon for his libels against
the papal court. In the same letter,
dated from Venice, April 21st, 1537,
he says that Bembo "has sent a
thousand souls to paradise by transferring
from Sienna to this Catholic
city Fra Bernardino, a religious as
humble as he is virtuous."</p>

<p>While at Venice, Ochino procured
a convent and installed there a community
of Capuchins. In June, 1539,
by invitation of the municipal assembly,
he preached at Sienna. This he
did again in the following year, with
great success and fruit. It was on
this occasion that he introduced the
devotion of the Quarant' Ore. It appears,
however, that instead of the
blessed sacrament, the usual object
of this devotion, Fra Bernardino exposed
for veneration the crucifix. In
a letter to the confraternity of St.
Dominic, preparatory to the introduction
of this pious practice, he
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You are asked in charity to join with
many others in accomplishing two very pious
and holy works&mdash;the first of which consists
in inviting and encouraging one another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
with a holy love, to do penance with a true
contrition, a sincere confession, and entire
satisfaction, joining spiritual and corporal
alms with fasts strictly kept and holy prayer,
in order to meditate on the transformation of
the soul in Christ, her well beloved; and,
humbly prostrate at his sacred feet, to expose
to him our particular spiritual wants
and those of all our brethren, encouraging
and aiding our soul, by good will, to clothe
herself with those divine virtues, faith, hope,
and charity."</p></blockquote>

<p>The remainder of the letter sets
forth in detail the arrangements for
carrying out the public ceremonies
of the Quarant Ore, all breathing the
fragrance of Catholic piety. Yet it is
more than probable that the first
plague-spots had already become visible
in his character. Boverio, the Capuchin
annalist, still praises him, thus
sketches this portion of our history,
and says that Fra Bernardino was</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"endowed with sagacity, good manners,
and practical skill in management gained by
a long and varied experience, gifted with a
penetration and generosity of soul fit for the
greatest enterprises, of an exterior so modest
and retiring that every one recognized
in him a rare stamp of virtue and sanctity;
an admirable preacher, whose eloquence won
souls, so that, by unanimous approval, in
the third chapter of the entire order, he was
elected general, in 1538. He governed the
order with such good sense, prudence, and
zeal for the observance of the rules, himself
giving an example of every virtue, that his
brethren applauded the choice of such a
man. He visited all the convents, nearly
always on foot. His exhortations to poverty,
to observance of the rule, and other virtues
were made with such admirable eloquence
that the reputation which he had
acquired both at home and abroad could not
but increase; he enjoyed such great confidence
with kings and princes that they employed
him in the most difficult undertakings;
the pope held him in the highest esteem;
so much so, that it was necessary to
have recourse to the pope in order to obtain
him for preacher; the largest churches did
not suffice to hold the throng of his hearers,
so that temporary porticoes had to be erected,
many even raising the tiles of the roof
and climbing into the church to hear him.
While preaching at Perugia, in 1540, he
settled the most angry feuds. At Naples,
having recommended from the pulpit some
pious work, the alms collected amounted
to five thousand sequins."</p></blockquote>

<p>To this we may add that when
three years, his term of office, had expired,
Fra Bernardino was reÃ«lected.
Yet, despite all this fair appearance,
things had not gone well in his heart.
His passions, restrained from sensual
outbreaks and left more free in other
things, developed pride, and confidence
in his own judgment, to the
contempt of others. The desire of
gaining souls yielded slowly and almost
imperceptibly to the ambition
of the orator. Moreover, he drew
from the works of Luther that fatal
tendency to find in Holy Writ a response
to the dictates of private passion
and prejudice. It is said that,
while preaching at Naples, in the
church of San Giovanni Maggiore,
he had been incited by Valdes to insult
Paul III., because the holy father
had not decorated him with the purple.
Certain it seems to be, that Valdes
was intimately associated with the
friar, and helped to fill his heart with
ambition and his head with the doctrines
of the Swiss and German heretics.
The viceroy, Pedro de Toledo,
being informed that he was teaching
the Lutheran novelties, complained
to the ecclesiastical authorities; but
Ochino either fairly stood the test of
inquiry, or concealed his real opinions
under astute forms of speech. The
latter is probably the case; for the
Dominican Caracciolo, in his <span class="smcap lowercase">MS.</span>
life of Paul IV., says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since he"&mdash;Ochino&mdash;"concealed within
himself the venom of his doctrines under
the appearance of an austere life, (a fair cloak,)
and because he pretended to thunder against
vice, the number of persons was small who
could detect the cunning of the fox. Nevertheless
there were some who discovered it;
and among the first, as I have learned from
my elders, could be cited our venerable
fathers Don Gaetano and Don Giovanni; but
they saw it more clearly in 1539, when
Ochino, preaching in the pulpit of the cathedral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
uttered many propositions against
purgatory, indulgences, and the ecclesiastical
laws about fasting, etc.; and, what is
worse, the impious monk was accustomed
to present as an interrogation that which St.
Augustine has said in a simply negative
form, as in the following passage: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui fecit
te sine te, non salvabit te sine te?</i>&mdash;thus giving
his audience to understand that faith alone
suffices, and that God saves us without any
good works on our part to coÃ¶perate with
his; just the contrary of that which St.
Augustine really teaches."</p></blockquote>

<p>Caracciolo further narrates that systematic
means were secretly taken
to spread these doctrines of Ochino,
and that clandestine meetings of those
infected contributed to this end. Yet
Fra Bernardino still kept his fair fame,
and maintained perfectly his Catholic
exterior; for the ensuing year witnessed
the public devotions at Sienna to
which we have before alluded. It
was at Venice, in 1541, that he was
for a time suspended from preaching.
This was not due to any plain and
palpable errors of doctrine. For, although
accusations against him had
been made by several persons, he had
in a private interview relieved the
nuncio's present suspicions, if not his
forebodings of the future. The temporary
prohibition to preach was
caused by the distrust of the nuncio,
which was greatly aggravated by an
allusion on the part of Ochino to
the arrest of Giulio Terenziano. The
latter was a theologian of Milan, an
avowed and contumacious preacher
of heresy, whom the nuncio had silenced
in the previous year. From
the pulpit Ochino appealed to the
Venetians against such an exercise
of authority. He placed himself on
the same footing with Terenziano, and
cried, "What have we done, O Venetians?
What plots have we arranged
against you? O Bride and Queen
of the Sea! if you cast into prison,
if you send to the gallows, those
who announce the truth to you, how
shall that truth prevail?" Nevertheless,
in three days the nuncio restored
to him his faculties, owing to
the pressure brought to bear by the
friends and admirers of the monk.</p>

<p>After the close of Lent in 1542,
Ochino gathered at Verona many of
the Capuchins of the Venetian province,
and taught them his errors
with all that subtlety of argument and
eloquence of persuasion which seems
to have characterized both his private
and public speaking.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He had now
passed the zenith of his career and
was fairly started on his downward
course. The luxury which he had
ordered Fra Angelo to use in rebuilding
the convent at Sienna, was so
openly against the letter and spirit of
his rule that many devout persons
looked for his speedy punishment. St.
Cajetan Tiene had prevented him from
preaching at Rome. Among the
number of those greatly alarmed for
his safety was Angela Negri de Gallarate,
a friend of the Marquis del
Vasto, the latter at this time an intimate
friend and private correspondent
of Ochino. This excellent lady, after
hearing Fra Bernardino at Verona,
where he commented on the epistles
of St. Paul, predicted that he would
fall into heresy. It soon became only
too manifest. His disgust for prayer,
his absence from the choir, his weariness
in assisting at the sacred mysteries
shocked his brethren, so long edified
by his pious bearing and assiduity
in these good works. Among others,
Fra Agustino, of Sienna, gently reproved
him, saying, "When you go to administer
the sacrament without prayer,
you remind me of a rider setting forth
without stirrups; take care that you
do not fall." Fra Bernardino, whose
soul was withering for want of that
celestial dew which falls only in the
calm evening stillness of prayer, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>worn and jaded as he was with earthly
labors, and, alas! success, could
only answer, that he did not cease
praying who kept on doing good.</p>

<p>He was now engrossed with secular
things, giving counsel in the affairs
of princes; and so completely was
his time occupied, that he requested
the holy father to be relieved from the
daily recitation of the divine office.
At this same period he entered into
friendly relations with the heretics,
and eagerly read all their works.</p>

<p>The pope still had hopes of holding
him back, invited him to Rome,
and even dreamed of giving him the
purple. This brought affairs to a crisis.
Before accepting or rejecting the
invitation, Ochino took council with
his friends. Giberti, the holy Bishop
of Verona, sent him to consult Cardinal
Contarini, at Bologna. The latter
was too ill to hold a long conversation,
and Ochino left him immediately
to seek Peter Martyr Vermigli, at
Florence. This visit to Peter Martyr,
who, already rotten to the core,
was shortly to fall, convinced the
Capuchin that his doctrines could
not stand the censorship of Rome,
and that, if he went there, he must
be prepared to renounce them. This
conviction and the urgent advice of
Peter Martyr decided him to leave
Italy immediately. On the 22d of
August, 1542, he writes to the Marquis
of Pescara, detailing his anxieties
and the causes of his flight.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have learned," he writes, "that Farnese
says I have been summoned to Rome
for having preached heresy and scandalous
things. The Theatine Puccio, and others
whom I do not wish to name, have spoken
so as to cause people to think that, if I had
crucified Christ, they could not have made
more noise about it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Further on he shows consciousness
of the sensation he is creating. "These
men," he says, "tremble before a poor
monk."</p>

<p>Flight being determined upon, he
took refuge, first, with Catharine Cibo,
Duchess of Camerino. Thence he
fled to Ferrara.</p>

<p>Here he received letters of introduction
to the principal heretics of
Geneva. On his way across the Apennines
he had taken with him Fra
Mariano, a saintly lay-brother, of
whose dove-like tenderness and simplicity
sweet anecdotes are told, recalling
the early memories of Assisi.
Mariano, under the impression that
they were going to preach to the heretics,
agreed to lay aside the religious
habit; but, on learning the fraud
which Ochino had practised on him,
sought to recall his unfortunate superior.
The haughty orator was proof
to the tears and entreaties of his humble
brother, and the latter finally turned
back alone, carrying the seal of
the order, which the apostate had
kept to the last.</p>

<p>Arrived at Geneva, Ochino was
welcomed by the heretics as a great
accession.</p>

<p>Calvin wrote to Melancthon, "We
have here Fra Bernardino, the famous
orator, whose departure has stirred
Italy as it has never been moved before."
Prayers for him, indeed, were
offered throughout Italy. Among
the Capuchins&mdash;who, it is said, came
near being suppressed&mdash;great pains
were taken to eradicate the evil germs
sown by Ochino; and Fra Francesco,
vicar of Milan, renouncing his heresies,
expiated them by a severe penance.
Cardinal Caraffa, who, a few
years later became Paul IV., publicly
lamented the apostasy of Ochino in
most eloquent terms, contrasting the
austere Capuchin with the unfrocked
preacher, and calling on the erring
son to return to his mother. He promised
in this case, moreover, kind
treatment from the pope, who had always
shown great favor to Ochino.</p>

<p>In a letter from Geneva, in April,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
1543, the apostate sought to justify
his career and to explain his later
course of action. This letter, addressed
to Muzio, begins with that allusion
to youthful enthusiasm, which has
since become the threadbare apology
of those who fling away the cowl.
He describes his life among the Observantines
in the words of the apostle,
"I made great progress in the
Jews' religion, above many of my
equals in my own nation, being more
zealous for the traditions of my fathers."
(Galat. i. 14.) But very soon
he was enlightened by the Lord to
the following effect: "That it is
Christ who has satisfied for the sins
of his elect, and has merited for them
paradise, and that he alone is their
justification; that the vows pronounced
in the religious orders are not only
invalid but impious; and that the
Roman Church, although of an exterior
splendid to carnal eyes, is none
the less an abomination in the sight
of God." This, he would have us
believe, took place before his entering
the Capuchin order. This doctrine
of the vanity of good works, of the
sinfulness of monastic vows, his excuse
for abandoning both, was rooted
in his mind during those years of rugged
asceticism, while he still preached
prayer and penance, as we have seen
at Sienna! A liar or a hypocrite?
Perhaps neither. For the remainder
of the letter is full of that fanatical
declamation against Antichrist and
the harlot of Babylon, and all that
railing cant in which weak brains
and over-excited imaginations have,
ever since, found expression and relief.
The magistrates of Sienna also
received a pointed letter, in which
Ochino set forth his doctrine on justification.
The letter is in very much
the same style as that to Muzio.</p>

<p>Poor, despised Carlstadt, when he
saw his hopeful pupil upset (as he
then supposed) the pope and cast the
church to the winds, thought that
surely Luther would not assume to
himself infallible authority and supreme
jurisdiction. In this he was
mistaken, as he found to his cost.
For men who aid in rebellion against
lawful authority too often find themselves
a prey to usurpers; and the
Bible, torn from the anointed hands
of its only rightful interpreter, became
simply a slave; its sacred text an exordium
for every fanatic and an accomplice
to every scoundrel. The
position which Ochino took was the
same as that of all other heresiarchs,
from him whom St. Polycarp addressed
as "the first born of Satan,"
down to the very latest. He constantly
applied to himself the language
which only one apostle dared
to use. Although he did not profess
to have seen the third heaven, yet he
did profess to be thoroughly competent
to teach and determine the Christian
revelation. Under these circumstances,
it is not strange that he soon
found himself in bad odor at Geneva,
where an authority, equally respectable,
and likewise acknowledging the
right of private examination, nevertheless
burned alive poor wretches
who were so unfortunate as not to
agree with it. After founding the
Italian Church at Geneva, and there
publishing several works, so outrageous
in their character as to draw condemnation
even from some Protestant
historians, Ochino became embroiled
with the Calvinists. The natural result
of these quarrels was his excommunication
and banishment by the
latter. He fled with a woman to
whom he had been sacrilegiously
married. At Basle, he published his
sermons. Thence he was called to
preach at Augsburg, where he enjoyed
great popularity and a salary,
until the invasion of Charles V. compelled
him to flee with Stancari of
Mantua. Having met, at Strasburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
his old friend, Peter Martyr, who,
meanwhile, had openly apostatized, he
journeyed with him to England, and
there preached to the Italian refugees.
On the death of Edward VI., he returned
to Switzerland, and was chosen
pastor of the exiles of Locarno, who
had obtained from the Senate the use
of a church and their native language.
But as at Geneva, so at Zurich, the
right of private judgment involved not
merely the right to believe as one might
list, but also the right, if one were
able, to force every body else to believe
in like manner. Ochino was
accused of anti-trinitarianism and also
of sanctioning polygamy, and obliged
to swear that he would live and die
in the faith of&mdash;what? who? The
Catholic Church, whose demand on
the human intellect is at once a command
to believe and a reason for
believing, backed by the pledged
word of Jesus Christ? No! Ochino
had rejected her authority. He now
swore to live and die in the teaching
of Zwinglius. This oath, however,
seemed to lose its force in a few days.
For he shortly attacked what he had
sworn to defend, and, in his <cite>Laberinto</cite>,
denied almost every article of the
Christian faith. Banished from Switzerland,
he fled, in the dead of winter,
with his four children, into Poland,
where he soon afterward earned universal
contempt, by publicly countenancing
King Sigismund in a projected
bigamy. Bullinger, whom Ochino
had called the "pope of Zurich," says
of him, "He is far advanced in the
science of perdition, and an ungrateful
wretch toward the senate and the
ministers, full of malice and impiety."
Beza also characterizes him as "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bernardinum
Ochinum, monachum magni
nominis apud Italos, et auctorem ordinis
Capucinorum, qui in fine se ostendit
esse iniquum hypocritam</i>. Bernardino
Ochino, a monk of great name among
the Italians, founder of the Capuchins,"
(this a mistake,) "who finally
showed himself to be a wicked hypocrite."</p>

<p>From these words of Beza, Boverio
has sought to infer that the apostate
finally repented and was restored to
the Catholic communion. He has
also introduced testimony to prove
that Ochino was poniarded at Geneva,
after professing the Catholic faith and
confessing to a priest. But historians
seem to favor the tradition recorded
by Graziani, who says, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ochinus Polonia
excessit, ac omnibus extorris ac profugus,
cum in vili MoraviÃ¦ pago a vetere
amico hospitio esset acceptus ibi senio
fessus cum uxore ac duabus filiabus,
filioque una peste interiit</i>. Ochino died
in Poland a universal outcast, after
having accepted the hospitality of an
old friend, in an obscure village of
Moravia. Here, worn out with age,
he perished, together with his wife, two
daughters and son, in one pestilence."</p>

<p>To rehearse the various opinions
of Ochino would be a difficult and
thankless task. Like most of the reformers,
he taught the total depravity
of human nature and human reason,
and, in order to establish the motives
of faith, appealed to private illumination,
assuming for the disciple what
he denied to the teacher.</p>

<p>Besides this miserable travesty of
the Christian distinction between the
natural and supernatural orders, there
is in his doctrine scarcely one point
of resemblance to the Catholic faith.
Having cast away the ballast that had
steadied his earlier years, the power
which had carried him on such a brilliant
course proved his ruin. His ignominious
death did not excite enough
pity to cause itself to be remembered.
He disappeared a lonely and abandoned
wreck.</p>

<h2>OLD BOOKS.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Let the world run after new books;
commend me to the enduring fascination
of old ones&mdash;not old only in
authorship, but old in imprint, in form
and comeliness, or perhaps <em>un</em>comeliness!</p>

<p>What value is there in gilded edges
and Turkey leather, which must be
handled so gingerly, compared with
the sturdy calfskin, ribbed and bevelled,
which has outlived generations
of human calves? and what is tinted
hot-press to the page grown yellow
in the atmosphere of centuries? The
quaintly spelt word, the ornamented
initial which begins each chapter, and
the more elaborate ornamentation of
dedication and title-page&mdash;all so poor
now as works of art, yet in their day
masterpieces of handicraft&mdash;there is
a spell in them! till from that olden
time</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>A heavy quarto lies here bearing
impress on its exterior, <cite>Workes of
Lvcivs AnnÃ¦vs Seneca. Both Morall

<p>Not so very old either; but within
that time what changes have passed
over the world! How often has ambition
or popular discontent, or perchance
honest resistance, revolutionized
nations, and swept away the
boundaries of kingdoms! How often
some power, seemingly inadequate to
the effect, has changed the currents
of human thought, and exalted or degraded
not only individuals, but aggregate
masses of humanity, as effectively
as the earthquake convulses,
and then depresses or upheaves the
visible surface on which they dwell!</p>

<p>What changes also in the especial
surroundings of this individual volume!
What improvements in the
petty affairs of domestic life, the little
arrangements of the household; in
the union of science and mechanical
art to produce necessaries and superfluities;
in refinements of sentiment
and manners; in a better relation between
rulers and the ruled; and, to
sum up all, in a more just appreciation
by each individual of what he
owes to himself and to his fellow-creatures!</p>

<p>All through the wide extent of this
past time history and legends stretch
back their ramifications, like paths
through some vast extended landscape.
In some places clear and well
defined, and easily followed; again,
leading through tangle and uncertainty,
and at more than one point brought
to an abrupt termination, beyond which
all vestige of a way is lost. We tread
here in thought a space of time which
has been passed over by millions and
millions&mdash;that countless throng of the
nameless whose steps have left no
foot-print&mdash;and where to a few only
has been accorded the privilege of
marking, by deed or word, the spot
whereon they stood. It is the buried
city of the immaterial world&mdash;where
is uncovered to us noble deeds, and
lofty aspirations, and holy purposes;
and in darker spots are wrecks of
hopes, and hearts, and immortal souls,
to which all the wealth gone down
in ocean counts as nothing.</p>

<p>To retrace again and again these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
paths, so often indistinct and so often
awakening an interest they fail to
gratify; to remove with patient toil
here the doubt and there the untruth
which encumber them, and anon to
clear away some obstacle and open to
sight a new vista, has been at all periods
the occupation and the richest
intellectual enjoyment of some of
the most gifted minds, who accepted
their ample reward in the simple success
of their labors. Even the more
humble wanderer through the mazy
labyrinth, whose limited scope it is
only to gaze and wonder, finds a charm
in such investigations widely different
from any other mental pursuit. It is
the charm of a common humanity&mdash;the
recognition and acknowledgment
of a chain, invisible and intangible,
and in a measure undefinable, but too
strong ever to be broken, which unites
each to the other the whole human
family. It is not religion&mdash;neither
philosophy; for in many a land, despite
the barbarous precepts of a so-called
religion, and where philosophy
was never heard of, it vibrates in the
savage heart to the necessities of the
stranger. Its first link is riveted in
our common origin; and its mysterious
existence widely and wisely asserts
itself in the interest with which,
for human creatures, is ever invested
the affairs of human kind.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is this great social
bond which attracts us to the personages
of fiction, and always precisely
in proportion as they assimilate to real
life; and since even the most successful
creations of fancy can hardly fail
to fall short, in some point, of realities,
so truth itself, properly presented,
will always possess attractions beyond
any fiction.</p>

<p>But it is not in battle-fields and conquests,
nor yet in the impassioned
eloquence or astute wisdom of senates
and council chambers, that we hold
closest communion with the buried of
long ago; it is in that homely every-day
life which we are ourselves living;
in the little pleasures, regrets, and
loves; in the annoyances, successes,
and failures; in the very mistakes and
imprudences which made up the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ego
ipse</i> so like our own that we find
companionship. How they return to
life again in all these things! and we
enter into their most private chambers&mdash;the
doors are all open now&mdash;and
read their most private thoughts. We
know them better than did their contemporaries;
and they suffer a wrong
sometimes in this ruthless unveiling
which our heart resents. Now, it is
proper that truth should ultimately,
even on earth, prevail; and that the
traitorous soldier and unscrupulous
courtier, after having lived their lives
out in ill-gotten wealth and undeserved
honor, should wear in history their
true colors; that even a woman's misdeeds,
when they touch public interest,
should be brought to meet a public
verdict; but then these little private
endurances&mdash;the life-long struggle
with poverty here, the unavailing
concessions to unreasonable tyranny
by home and hearth there, the martyrdom
of life, as it may be called,
which they so carefully guarded from
sight&mdash;how it is all paraded now to
the world, and passed from book to
book!</p>

<p>And yet it takes all this to make up
the entire truthful portrait. Indeed, so
very far does it go to modify our
opinions of them, that the judgments
formed without it must be oftentimes
very erroneous.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Had our old book but a tongue,
what tales it might tell of the life after
life which has passed before it!</p>

<p>Since the date of its printing, 1614,
twelve sovereigns have worn the English
crown; for in that year James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
I. was upon the throne of his mother's
enemy. Eleven years before, when a
messenger was sent to him in Scotland
with an announcement of the
death of Elizabeth and his own accession,
the tidings found him so poor
that he was obliged to apply to the
English secretary, Cecil, for money to
pay his expenses to London. His
wants multiplied rapidly. From his
first stopping-place he sent a courier
forward to demand the crown jewels
for his wife; and a little further on
another messenger was dispatched for
coaches, horses, litters, and, "above
all, a chamberlain much needed."</p>

<p>This journey of James was a very
unique affair. Honors were scattered
so lavishingly that knighthood was to
be had for the asking; and a little
pasquinade appeared in print, advertising
itself&mdash;<i>A Help to Memorie in
learning Names of English Nobility</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At Newark-upon-Trent (says Stow) was
taken a cut-purse, a pilfering thief all gentleman
outside, with good stores of gold about
him, who confessed he had followed the court
from Berwick; and the king, hearing of this
gallant, did direct a warrant to have him
hanged immediately."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And so began at the very outset the
spirit which said afterward, "Do I
make the lords? Do I make the
bishops? Then God's grace&mdash;I make
what likes me of law and gospel!"
So outspoke the king; who is described
by those who went to meet him
as "ill-favored in appearance, slovenly,
dirty, and wearing always a wadded
dagger-proof doublet."</p>

<p>These eleven years of his reign had
been fruitful in troubles of all kinds.
The death of his son Henry, and the
alleged, but never proven schemes
of Lady Arabella Stuart to gain the
throne, made a portion of them; and
all were aggravated by that spectre,
conjured up by his reckless extravagance,
and which haunted him to the
last moment of his life&mdash;an empty
purse. When his daughter Elizabeth
was married to the Palatine of Bohemia,
the fireworks alone of London
cost seven thousand pounds; and
when my Lord Hargrave accompanied
the bride to the Rhine and brought
back a bill of thirty thousand pounds,
the king, having neither gold nor silver
to pay with, gave him a grant <i>to coin
base farthings in brass</i>.</p>

<p>King James, in a book which he
wrote on <i>Sports</i>, advocates all active
exercises, and one of his own greatest
pleasures had always been hunting.
When so engaged, every thing else was
forgotten, and hence arose a grievance
by no means trifling to his English
subjects&mdash;he and his courtiers, his
companions in the chase, not unfrequently
quartered themselves in some
district where game abounded, until
the provisions of the locality were
absolutely exhausted. There is a
story told of him that, while hunting
at Royston, his favorite hound
Jowler was missed one day, and the
next he reappeared with a paper fastened
on his neck, upon which was
written&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Good Mister Jowler, I pray you speak
to the king, for he hears you every day, (and
he doth not so us,) that it will please his
majesty to go back to London, for all our
provision is spent." ... "however, (says
the courtier,) from Royston he means to go
to New-Market, and from thence to Thetford."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>How much further he might have
been led to hunt, is unknown; for
there Lord Hay, who loved hounds,
and horns also, promised no more to
importune his majesty, and his more
sedate counsellors succeeded in getting
him back to business. In the mean
time, in the more weighty matters of
politics and religion, where the ambitious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>nobles of two countries intrigued
and plotted for power over a monarch
easily imposed upon, discord and contention
reigned, until in 1614 they
seem to have reached their height.</p>

<p>And so stood the world, old book!
into which thou wert launched. Guy
Fawkes and his crew had been swept
from the earth; but in the Tower of
London this year lay a more noble
company, accused of the same crime&mdash;treason.
There was Earl Grey, and
Lord Cobham, and Sir Walter Raleigh,
besides some others. These three had
been tried, convicted, sentenced to die,
and taken to the scaffold; and at the
last moment reprieved and committed
to the Tower. At the last moment it
was, and it came near being a minute
too late; for James wrote his order in
such haste that he forgot to sign it,
and the messenger was called back;
then when this one man on horseback
reached the place of execution, the
great crowd gathered there prevented
his being seen or heard for a long time,
and the axe was just ready for the
fatal stroke. On what a chance hung
three lives! But what availed their
added years? Earl Grey is dying now
in that Tower; and Lord Cobham,
never very strong in intellect, has
grown weaker still in captivity; and
so, after a little time, he is suffered to
wander out; and he goes to a miserable
hovel in the Minories, and climbs
a ladder to a loft, and lies down on
straw&mdash;to die of very destitution.</p>

<p>Three years hence King James will
want money even more than he does
now; and he will call Sir Walter Raleigh
from his cell, and place him at
the head of a fleet; for Sir Walter&mdash;who
has been to the new world in
years long gone by&mdash;insinuates that
<em>there</em> gold is to be had for the digging.
He fails to get it, though; and
on his return to England, he is seized,
and, with only the shadow of a just
trial, executed; partly on the old sentence,
but more to please the Spaniards,
whom he came in conflict with
abroad.</p>

<p>Another life is this year pining itself
away in that Tower&mdash;the Lady Arabella
Stuart; a woman descended
from royalty, Henry VII., in the same
degree as King James himself, and
therefore to be feared. Many years
ago charges of conspiracy against the
government were brought against her,
and she was placed in confinement.
She contrived to escape, and with her
husband, Lord Seymour, attempted
to reach France. By some mischance
they were separated in their flight;
he reached the coast of Flanders in
safety, but the little vessel in which
she had embarked was pursued, overtaken,
and the unhappy fugitive compelled
to return. Love and hope bore
her up bravely for a time; but she is
sinking at last, and it is recorded
that September 27th, 1615, she died
there.</p>

<p>High above all this misery merry
notes were heard; for in 1614, was
a grand marriage and banqueting
such as London had not seen&mdash;no, not
even at the bridal of the king's own
daughter. The story is sadder than
any fiction, a "sad o'er true tale"&mdash;as
follows:</p>

<p>Some years before this, the Lady
Frances Howard, daughter of the
Earl of Suffolk, beautiful and accomplished,
though still a mere child of
thirteen years, was married to the Earl
of Essex, a few years older. The ceremony
was merely to secure the alliance;
for the young countess returned
to her home and her embroidery,
and the earl to the university. Four
years after, he went to claim the bride
whose image had doubtless oftentimes
stolen between him and his books;
"but (says the chronicle) his joy was
overcast: he found her cold and contemptuous,
and altogether averse to
him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>A change had come over the lady.
She had met her evil genius in the
unprincipled favorite of King James,
the Lord Rochester, who on his side
was vain of his conquest. At this
point Lady Frances is an object of
pity; for she was the victim of a
usage of courts which makes and mars
the most solemn of all contracts without
the least regard to individual
bias; a usage which is responsible for
some of the blackest crimes of history;
but, O woman! from thy first steps
downward how rapid is the descent;
wandering thoughts, folly&mdash;crime!
Such was the story of Lady Frances.
Pity changes to horror at her subsequent
career, and the unscrupulous
vindictiveness which she displayed
toward all those who strove to arrest
her course. Most conspicuous among
such was Sir Thomas Overbury, the
bosom friend of Lord Rochester himself.
He had more than once aided
their meetings, and&mdash;so said gossip&mdash;had
even penned the epistles which
won her; but he became alarmed at
the length to which their ventures
were carried; and when the next step
proposed was a divorce from the Earl
Essex, he gave Rochester much good
advice and solemn warning that he
withdrew his aid in future. This
was reported to the countess, and his
doom was sealed. She failed in several
attempts to involve him in individual
disputes, whereby, as she hoped,
a duel might have closed his life;
she failed in having him sent in a public
capacity abroad; she succeeded,
however, in having him implicated in
disloyalty and committed to the Tower,
when shortly after he suddenly
died. A divorce was now sought on
some trifling pretext; and as no remonstrance
was offered by Earl Essex, it
was soon obtained; and in order that
she might not lose rank, King James
created Rochester Earl of Somerset.</p>

<p>And now, with nothing to mar their
felicities, London was ablaze with bonfires
over their marriage celebration.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The glorious days were seconded by as
glorious nights, when masques and dances
had a continual motion; the king affecting
such high-flying festivities and banqueting
as might wrap up his spirit and keep it from
earthly things.... Upon the Wednesday
following was another grand masque,
got up by the gentlemen of Prince Charles's
household; and this so far surpassed the
other, that the king caused it to be acted
again. Then, January 4th, the bride and
bridegroom with a crowd of nobles were invited
to a treat in the city, where my lord
mayor and aldermen entertained them in
scarlet gowns. After supper was a wassail,
a play, and a dance.... At three in
the morning, they returned to Whitehall.
On Twelfth-day the gentlemen of Grey's Inn
invited the bride and bridegroom to masque."
(Roger Coke.)</p></blockquote>

<p>A brilliant triumph, soon to meet
with a dark reverse. Scarcely a year
had passed, when a new candidate for
the king's favor appeared in Villiers,
afterward created Duke of Buckingham;
and the weak monarch, readily
attracted by a new face, was very
soon anxious to rid himself of Somerset.
Enemies of the still beautiful
countess were not slow to avail themselves
of the royal mood; nor was it
difficult to find in her questionable
career a pretext for suspicion. With
consent of the king, they were conjointly
accused of having caused the
death of Sir Thomas Overbury by
poison, and sent to the Tower. It is
recorded that Earl Somerset was hunting
with the king at Royston, and
actually sitting beside him when the
warrant was served; and when he appealed
to his royal master to forbid
the indignity, King James only answered,</p>

<p>"An' ye <em>must</em> go, mon; for if Coke
sent for <em>me</em>, I must go."</p>

<p>After the examination of some three
hundred witnesses, Sir Edward Coke
reported that the countess had used
unlawful arts to separate herself from
Earl Essex, and to win the love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Rochester, and that they had together
plotted the death of Sir Thomas
Overbury. Some of the inferior actors
in the tragedy were condemned
and executed; among them Mrs. Turner,
who had in former years been
governess to the countess, and who
had once persuaded her to consult a
wizard or fortune-teller&mdash;from whence
came the charge of "unlawful arts."
The unhappy principals were repeatedly
questioned, and exhorted to confess;
but with no avail. The countess
at times made some admissions,
but none which implicated the earl
or seriously convicted herself; and we
are fain to believe they arose rather
from her unmitigated misery, and the
harassing importunities of her judges,
than from conscious guilt. They
were at length restored to liberty&mdash;at
least to the liberty of banishment from
court; liberty to return to their country-seat
and remain there; and there,
a writer of that day tells us, "they
lived in the same house many years
without exchanging a word with each
other."</p>

<p>King James seems to have devoted
no small portion of his time to advancing
the interests of Cupid&mdash;if love it
could be called, where love there was
none. Sir Edward Coke had himself
an only daughter, whom the king assigned
to Viscount Purbeck, brother
of the Duke of Buckingham. The
wife of Coke, Lady Hatton, was a
very Xantippe; and the eloquence of
the great jurist, which could sway
multitudes, and check or change the
course of political events, was totally
powerless within the walls of his own
castle. Lady Hatton wisely opposed
this match, to which her daughter
was averse; but in this case the king
as well as Sir Edward had decided,
and for once she was obliged to yield;
"the king doing the matter (says an
old writer) as if the safety of the nation
depended on its completion." Lady
Hatton had one retaliation within her
reach, and she took it; she gave orders
that at the wedding "neither Sir
Edward Coke nor any of his servants
be admitted."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>How fared at last the hapless Lady
Purbeck, the heiress of thousands and
thousands? She had the misery to
see the husband <em>not</em> of her choice become
in a short time hopelessly insane;
while his brother, under pretence
of looking after his affairs, left
her, at times, almost penniless. Her
letters to this unprincipled miscreant,
written oftentimes under bodily as
well as mental suffering, are truly
touching. In one of them she says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Think not to send me again to my mother.
I will beg my bread in the streets, to
all your dishonors, rather than more trouble
my friends." (Letter in the Caballa.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Such were the tales of wretchedness
within the precincts of a court.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The career of King James and his
son after the insolent and unscrupulous
Buckingham appeared to lead
or drive them, as the case might be,
seems scarcely the actual history of
sane men. When the downfall of
Somerset left him supreme master, he
seems to have taken possession of both
king and palace. He soon sent for
his kindred from all parts of the country;
and their arrival is thus described:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... the old countess, his mother, providing
a place for them to learn to carry
themselves in a court-like garb. He desired
to match them with wives and husbands,
inasmuch as his very female kindred were
enough to stock a plantation. So that King
James, who in former times so hated women,
had his lodgings replenished with them; ...
little children did run up and down the
king's lodgings like little rabbits; ... for
the kindred had all the houses about Whitehall,
like bulwarks and flankers to a citadel."
(Weldon.)</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>
<p>The most amusing event&mdash;or rather
the most amusing absurdity in
the annals of that period, or one
might say of any other period&mdash;was
the expedition of Prince Charles to
Spain, in 1623, to bring home a wife.</p>

<p>Lord Bristol was at the court of
Philip IV., negotiating a marriage
between the infanta, his sister, and
Prince Charles, and endeavoring to
secure for him her magnificent dower;
when Buckingham, thinking he was
gaining too much credit by his labors,
felt desirous of going himself to the
spot and taking a part in the matter.</p>

<p>How was this to be accomplished?
His wits never failed him. He approached
Charles with a general lamentation
over royal marriages, where
the parties meet first at the altar&mdash;too
late to retreat&mdash;and suggested to him
the advantages and romance of presenting
himself in person to the infanta,
and bringing her home a bride.
Charles was charmed with the quixotic
notion, and they adjourned to
the palace to obtain the king's consent.
He at first flatly refused; then
consented. The next day he fell into
a passion of tears, and prayed to be
released from his promise; for he feared
the dangers of the journey, and the
false reports and suspicions it might
give rise to among his subjects. Charles
was persuasive, the duke indignant
and insolent, and once more the king
told them to go. In the words of a
historian&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... "So he said he would send Sir
Francis Cottington and Endymion Porter
with them; and he called Cottington in and
told him that baby Charles and Stenie (as
he always called them) had a mind to go to
Spain and bring the infanta; and Cottington
being pressed to speak of it, said it was both
unsafe and unwise; whereupon the king
wept again, and said, 'I told you so! I told
you so!' Then Buckingham abused them
all."</p></blockquote>

<p>After another storm of words, it
was decided that they should go in
disguise, with only these two attendants.
Their incognito was very poorly
carried out; for at Gravesend they
were suspected by giving gold coin,
and at Canterbury they would have
been arrested, had not Buckingham
taken off his false wig and privately
made himself known to the mayor.
Finally they reached Dover, where
they found Cottington, who had gone
on before, in readiness with a vessel,
and they set sail for the French coast.</p>

<p>In Paris, a Scottish nobleman who
had somehow received intimation of
their being there, called late one night
on the English ambassador, and asked
if he had seen the prince. "What
prince?" "Prince Charles," was the
reply; but it was too incredible for
belief. Yet while in Paris, although
not considering it worth their while
to visit the British ambassador, they
contrived to gain admission, without
being recognized, to a court dancing-party,
where Charles saw for the first
time the fascinating Princess Henrietta.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The consternation in England when
their departure, so unbefitting royalty,
was discovered, can scarcely be imagined.
The king ordered prayers to
be offered for their safe return; but no
allusion made to their destination. A
gentleman of that day, named Meade,
writing to a friend, tells this story:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Bishop of London, you know, gave
orders, as from the king, that they pray for
the safe return of the prince to us; and no
more. An honest, plain preacher here prayed
'that God would return our noble prince
to us, and no more!' thinking it all a piece
of the prayer."</p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile these two knights-errant,
or, as the king said, "sweet boys
and dear venturous knights, worthy
to be put in a new romanzo,"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> continued
their journey. At last, at the
close of an evening in March, two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>mules stopped at the house of my
Lord Bristol in Madrid, and the riders
alighted. <i>Mr. Thomas Smith</i> went
in first with a portmanteau under his
arm&mdash;then <i>Mr. John Smith</i> was called
in; and before the amazed diplomatist
stood the heir to the British
crown and the Marquis of Buckingham.
He stared as if he had seen
two ghosts; but he presently took
Prince Charles to a bed-chamber, and
dispatched a courier to inform his
father of his safe arrival.</p>

<p>The Spanish court took the matter
in its most chivalrous light, as the
impulse of a lover; although rather
puzzled how to arrange a reception
in a case which certainly had no precedent.
The Spanish people were
enthusiastic. The infanta blushed
charmingly at such unheard-of homage,
and began to study English.
King James sent over a troop of
courtiers for a retinue, who proved a
rough set&mdash;"jeering at the cookery
and the religion, and making themselves
odious."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The Spanish prime
minister was soon disgusted with Buckingham,
and would have been still
more so if he could have understood
all his swearing words&mdash;"which fortunately
he cannot, (says a contemporary,)
because they are done in English."</p>

<p>The letters which passed between
this precious couple and the king at
home are amusing. A want of money
was his majesty's normal condition;
and the pitiless way in which
they seemed to ignore it, by making
constant requisitions on his purse,
is surprising and amusing effrontery.
Prince Charles writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I confess you have sent me more jewels
than I'd have use for but here, seeing so
many. Some that you have appointed me to
give the infanta, in Stenie's opinion and
mine are not fit for her. I pray your majesty
send more for my own wearing."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then Buckingham defines more precisely
their necessities.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Though your baby himself hath sent
word what needs he hath, yet will I give my
poor and saucy opinion what will be fittest
to send. Sire, he hath neither chain, or
hat-band; and pray you consider how rich
they are here, and since your chiefest jewel
is here, your son, I pray you let loose these
after him. First, your best hat-band of the
Portugal diamond, and the rest of the pendants
to make up a necklace to give his mistress.
Also the best rope of pearls, with a
rich chain or two for himself, and some
other jewels, not to deserve that name, that
will serve for presents and save your purse.
They never had so great occasion to get out
of their boxes as now."</p></blockquote>

<p>King James found consolation in
believing that they would soon return
with the infanta and her dower; so
he strove his best to supply them, and
touched on smaller matters. He besought
baby Charles and Stenie not
to forget their dancing, though they</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"should whistle or sing, one for the other,
for the lack of better music; ... but
you must be as sparing as you can in your
spending, for your officers are put to the
height of their speed.... I pray you,
my baby, take care of being hurt if you run
at tilt." (Letters in Ellis Collec.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Difficult as it was for the king to
satisfy their pecuniary demands, and
desirous though he was to act on
Prince Charles's frequent suggestion,
to "consult no counsel, but leave all
to Stenie and me," he received from
them some proposals which rather exceeded
his powers of acceptance; one
of which was nothing less than that,
to please Spain, he should acknowledge
the pope's spiritual supremacy!<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Probably at this point some little vision
of the people of England flitted
over him; for he replied that he had
made a great many concessions already,
and added&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"Now, I cannot change my religion
as a man changes his shirt at tennis."</p></blockquote>

<p>The end of their expedition, and
of the negotiations with Spain, are
well known. After meeting the most
honorable hospitality, they raised objections
which they never intended
to have removed, and made promises
which they never meant to fulfil; and
returned home without the infanta,
and without her dower, to reject with
insult the Spanish alliance and lay the
blame on Spain.</p>

<p>King James died like any common
mortal, in the most literal acceptation
of the phrase. The same slight cold
passing into mortal sickness, the
household called up in alarm at day-dawn,
the same hugging on to the
dear old life. The countess, mother
of Buckingham, "ran with a draught
and a posset;" he took the draught
and applied the posset, but it was too
late&mdash;and the prince, as Charles I.,
succeeded him.</p>

<p>Charles had married the sister of
the French king, the Princess Henrietta,
whose dancing had captivated
his youthful fancy on his way to
Spain; but some little discord and
confusion had crept into the music
and dancing of their English home.
He had promised religious freedom
for herself and her household. Her
retinue was very numerous, and, with
different religious creeds and widely
different social habits, it is not surprising
that year by year a sort of
estrangement seemed to grow up
between them. His majesty ascribed
this to foreign influence; and he resolved
to rule his own household, and
in that very expressive phrase&mdash;<i>make
a clean sweep</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One fine afternoon the king went unannounced
to the queen's side of the house,
and finding some Frenchmen dancing and
curvetting in her presence, took her hand
and led her to his own lodgings; ...
then my Lord Conway called forth the
French bishop and others, and told them the
king's pleasure was that all her majesty's
servants of that nation, men and women,
old and young, with three or four exceptions,
should depart the kingdom. The bishop
stood on, that he could not go unless the
king his master commanded; but he was
told the king his master had nothing to do
in England.... The women howled
and wept as if they were going to execution;
but it did no good, they were thrust
out and the doors locked."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Buckingham was charged with their
transportation and shipping at Dover;
and his master wrote&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Stick not long in disputing with them,
Stenie; but drive them away like wild beasts&mdash;and
the devil go with them."</p></blockquote>

<p>But an ambassador was dispatched
to the French court with explanations.</p>

<p>The civil wars which desolated the
kingdom under Charles I., and stained
the soil of England with English
blood, are familiar to all. Buckingham
fell by the knife of an assassin.
Whether sadly unwise or fearfully criminal,
the king expiated his mistakes
with his life. He was seized and imprisoned;
and after a trial condemned
and executed. His queen, Henrietta,
with her children, all except one,
were in France for safety. His little
daughter, the Princess Elizabeth, was
in England, and at his request was
conducted to him the last evening
of his life. Then, says Whitlock,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"it was sad to see him&mdash;he took the princess
in his arms and kissed her, and gave
her two diamonds; and there was great
weeping."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is preserved, in several collections
of old poetry, a long and pathetic
elegy, written by King Charles
at Carisbrook Castle, where he was
imprisoned; it is entitled, <cite>An Imploration
to the King of Kings</cite>, and he
sadly says therein&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>Commonwealth of England</i>,
whose first grand state seal dated
1648, came virtually to its end at the
death of its founder in 1658; and a
few years later Charles II. was called
from exile to the throne of his fathers.</p>

<p>He is called the <i>merrie</i> monarch;
but very far from <i>merrie</i> was the nation
under his rule&mdash;dissensions and
discontent pervaded it in every direction.
The truth is, that the prominence
given in brief histories to this
epithet, the madcap frolics of his
court, the witty and unprincipled
nobles, and the uncommon array of
female beauty which made up the
surroundings of his own indolence
and love of pleasure, lead to a sort
of general idea that all England was
one grand carousal. A nearer view
changes the scene. The religious
contests between conformists and non-conformists,
which began in 1662
and lasted some twenty-six years&mdash;the
fruitful harvest planted in preceding
years of anarchy and fanaticism&mdash;present
pictures of persecution and
suffering such as enter only into religious
warfare; and which, perhaps,
it is most charity to refer to the importance
which the opposing parties attach
to their subject. During these
twenty-six years it is computed that
the penalties which were inflicted
amounted to between twelve and
fourteen millions sterling, and the sufferers
for conscience' sake numbered
60,000. Homeless, and hungry, and
penniless, they wandered about or
were immured in jails; and contemporary
writers (Defoe, Penn) assert that
from 5000 to 8000 perished "like
sheep, in those noisome pest-houses."
Surely that was not the day of <i>merrie</i>
old England, beyond the precincts of
the court.</p>

<p>Charles was succeeded by his brother,
James II., who was soon deposed,
and William, Prince of Orange,
who had married his daughter Mary,
was invited to the throne. Next to
these came another daughter of James,
Queen Anne; and with her expired the
line of the Stuarts. The dark fortunes
of Mary Stuart rested in some form
on all her descendants.</p>

<p>In what quiet library, in what
lordly mansion, was this old book
safely stored away through all these
changing scenes of pageantry and
splendor, of riot and bloodshed? Who
was he that first received it, new and
comely, from the hands of <i>William
Stanly, printer</i>, (who is saved to fame
in a little corner of the title-page,)
and what name is this, written on the
margin in ink, embrowned now and
almost obliterated, which evidently
was once intended to establish ownership?
The dedication to my Lord of
Ellismere bespeaks for it a place with
the noble and learned; who among
them found time then to seek</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"how to liue wel and how to die wel, from
our Seneca&mdash;whose diuine sentences, wholesom
counsailes, serious exclamations against
vices, in being but a heathen, may make us
ashamed being Christians." (Translator's
preface.)</p></blockquote>

<p>What statesman, by lamplight perhaps,
when the toils of the day were
over, turned these very pages, and
drew a rule for his steps from the
maxims of the Roman? Hadst
thou but a tongue, old book, what
tales thou mightest tell! Where wert
thou when that pestilence, the plague,
swept from London 100,000 of its inhabitants?
or where when its career
was checked by that other horror,
the great conflagration? when the
bells from a hundred steeples tolled
their own requiem, and the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of houses in London was diminished
by 13,000.</p>

<p>One hundred years had passed over
it when George I. ascended the English
throne; then came Georges II.,
III., and IV., King William and Queen
Victoria. Under the two first, no
small portion of the troubles, both at
home and with foreign nations, were
traceable to the plots and intrigues of
the last solitary scion of the house of
Stuart; and with George III. a new
war boomed over the Atlantic. At
last it was finished; and at the somewhat
mature age of two hundred and
fifty-six years, but still in good condition,
our time-honored volume has
crossed the ocean to find a new home
under the stripes and stars. One
more exponent, in its silent eloquence,
of that</p>

<h2>THE VATICAN COUNCIL.<br />

<small>NUMBER FOUR.</small></h2>


<p>Another month of the Vatican
Council has passed by without any
public session. There has not been
a general congregation since February
22d, when the twenty-ninth was
held. This absence of grand public
ceremonials has driven some of the
newspaper correspondents to turn elsewhere
in search of sensational items.
We are no longer inundated, and at
times amused, by column after column
of newspaper accounts narrating
speeches and events in the council
that had scarcely any existence, except
in the fertile imaginations of the
writers. The outward calm in Rome
has produced its effect in no small
extent in the newspaper world.</p>

<p>This calm, however, is by no means
the calm of inaction. Quite the contrary.
At no time were the fathers
so assiduously engaged in the deep
study of the matters before them, or
more earnestly occupied with their
conciliar labors.</p>

<p>We stated in our last number that
they were then engaged in the discussion
of the subjects of discipline, on
which several <i>schemata</i>, or draughts, had
been drawn up by preparatory committees
of theologians, in anticipation
of the council. The discussion was
continued, on February 19th, with six
speakers, on the 21st with seven speakers,
and was closed on the 22d with
seven other speakers, when the fourth
<i>schema</i>, or draught, on discipline, was
referred, as the preceding ones had
been, to the appropriate committee or
<i>deputation</i> on matters of discipline.</p>

<p>Thus, within two months, since the
congregation of December 28th, when
the discussion began, one <i>schema</i> on
faith and four on discipline had come
up before the bishops; and there had
been in all one hundred and forty-five
speeches delivered on them. The experience
of those two months had
made several points very clear:</p>

<p>First, the <i>schemata</i>, or draughts, as
prepared by the theologians, did not
prove as acceptable to the bishops as
perhaps their authors had expected.
On the contrary, the bishops subjected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
them to a very searching examination
and discussion, criticising and
weighing every point and every expression;
and seemed disposed, in
measure, to recast some of them entirely.</p>

<p>Secondly, the mode in which this
examination had so far been conducted
might, it was thought, be improved,
both in its thoroughness and in
the length of time it occupied. So
far, all the prelates who wished had
spoken one after another. The sittings
of the congregations usually
lasted from nine <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to one <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, and
became a great trial of the physical
endurance of many of these aged
men. The prelates could not refrain
from asking each other, What progress
are we making? How long
will this series of speeches last?</p>

<p>Again, many of the speakers, unwilling
to occupy the attention of the
congregation too long, strove to condense
what they wished to say, and
sometimes omitted much that might
have thrown additional light on the
subject, or would be material for the
support of their views. Yet how could
this be avoided without extending
the discussion beyond the limits of
endurance.</p>

<p>Still more, many prelates, whose
mature and experienced judgments
would have been most valuable, would
not speak; some, because they were
unwilling to increase the already large
number of speakers; others, because
their organs of speech were too feeble
to assure their being heard throughout
a hall which held over a thousand
persons in by no means crowded seats.</p>

<p>These points had gradually made
themselves manifest, and, as we intimated
in our last article, the question
had been raised, how these difficulties
could be met. Some suggested a
division of the prelates into a number
of sections, in each and all of which
the discussions might go on at the
same time. But, after much consideration,
another method was resolved
on, and was announced in the congregation
of the 22d of February as
the one to be followed in the examination
and discussion of the next
<i>schema</i>, or draught, to be taken up by
the council.</p>

<p>The main points of these additional
regulations are the following: When
a <i>schema</i> comes before the council
for examination, instead of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vivÃ¢
voce</i> discussion, which according to
the first system would take place in
the congregations, before sending it
to the proper committee, if necessary,
the cardinals presiding shall fix and
announce a suitable time, within which
any and every one of the fathers, who
desires to do so, may commit his
views on it to writing, and shall send
in the same to the secretary of the
council. Any amendments, additions,
and corrections which he may wish
to make must be fully and clearly
written out. The secretary must, at
the end of the appointed time, transmit
to the appropriate committee, or
<i>deputation</i> of bishops, all the remarks
on the <i>schema</i>. The <i>schema</i>
will be examined and remodelled, if
necessary, by the committee, under the
light of these written statements, precisely
as would be done if the members
had before them the full report
of speeches made in the former style
before the congregation. The reformed
<i>schema</i> is again presented to the
congregation, and with it a summary
exposition of the substance of the remarks
and of the amendments proposed.
"When the <i>schema</i>, together with
the aforesaid summary, has been distributed
to the fathers of the council, the
said presidents shall appoint a day
for its discussion in general congregation."
In parliamentary usage, this
corresponds to having the discussion,
not on the first, but on the second
reading of a bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>This discussion must proceed in the
strict order of topics, first generally;
that is, on the <i>schema</i> wholly or in
part, as it may have been brought before
the congregation; then on the
several portions of it, one by one.
The speakers who wish to take part
in the discussion must, in giving in
their names as before, state also whether
they intend to speak on the <i>schema</i>
as a whole, or on some special parts
of it, and which ones. The form of
amendment, should a speaker propose
one, must be handed in, in writing,
at the conclusion of his speech. Of
course, the speakers must keep to the
point in debate. If any one wanders
from it, he will be called to order.
The members of the reporting committee
or deputation will, moreover,
be free to speak in reply, during the
debate, as they judge it advisable.</p>

<p>The last four of these by-laws are
the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>XI. "If the discussion be unreasonably
protracted, after the subject has been sufficiently
debated, the cardinals presiding, on
the written request of at least ten bishops,
shall be at liberty to put the question to the
fathers whether the discussion shall continue.
The fathers shall vote by rising or
retaining their seats; and if a majority of
the fathers present so decide, they shall close
the discussion.</p>

<p>XII. "When the discussion on one part
of a <i>schema</i> is closed, and before proceeding
to another, the presiding cardinals shall take
the votes of the general congregation, first
on the amendments proposed during the
discussion itself, and then on the whole context
of the part under consideration.</p>

<p>XIII. "The votes, both as to the amendments
and as to the context of such part,
will be given by the fathers in the following
mode: First, the cardinals presiding shall
require those who assent to the amendment
or text to rise; then, by a second call,
shall require those who dissent to rise in
their turn; and after the votes have been
counted, the decision of the majority of the
fathers will be recorded.</p>

<p>XIV. "When all the several parts of a
<i>schema</i> have been voted on in this mode,
the cardinals presiding shall take the judgment
of the fathers on the entire <i>schema</i>
under examination as a whole. These votes
shall be given <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vivÃ¢ voce</i>, by the words, <span class="smcap">Placet</span>
or <span class="smcap">Non Placet</span>. But those who think
it necessary to add any condition shall give
their votes in writing."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is already evident that the first
provision of these by-laws or regulations
is attaining its purpose. At the
congregation of February 22d, when
they went into force, a certain portion
of a new <i>schema</i>, or draught, on
matters of faith, was announced as the
next matter regularly coming up for
examination, and the space of ten
days was assigned within which the
fathers might write out their criticisms,
and propose any emendations or
amendments to it, and send such written
opinions to the secretary. There
was no limit to hamper the bishops in
the fullest expression of their sentiments.
They might write briefly, or
at as great length as they deemed
proper. Moreover, in writing, they
would naturally be more exact and
careful than perhaps they could be
in speeches often made extempore.
There would also be less liability of
being misunderstood. Moreover, many
more could and probably would
write than would have spoken. It is
said over one hundred and fifty did
so write on this first occasion; so
that, in reality, as much was done
in those ten days as under the old
system would have occupied two
months. The second portion, touching
the debate before the congregation,
will of course be effective and satisfactory.
And it is confidently hoped
that the third portion, as to the mode
of closing the debate and taking the
vote, will, when the time comes for
testing it, be found equally satisfactory.</p>

<p>In our previous numbers we have
avoided falling into the very error of
the correspondents which we have
repeatedly blamed; we have not pretended
to have succeeded in getting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
glimpse behind the curtain which veils
the council, and so to have qualified
ourselves to speak without reserve of
the matters treated by the fathers in
their private debates. Even had circumstances
brought some knowledge
of this to us, it would be under obligations
which would effectually prevent
our touching on it in these articles.
But we can be under no such obligation
in regard to questions which, if we
are correctly informed, have not come,
at least up to the present time, before
the congregations of the council.
There is one such question which excites
universal attention, perhaps we
should rather say universal talk, outside
the council&mdash;the infallibility of
the pope. It has become in Europe
the question of the day. Books have
been written on it, pamphlets discussing
it are issued every week, and England,
France, Germany, and Spain
have been deluged with newspaper
articles upholding it or attacking it&mdash;articles
written with every possible
shade of learning and of ignorance,
and in every degree of temper, from
the best to the worst. The articles
are what might be expected when the
writers are of every class, from erudite
theologians down to penny-a-liners,
and when, if some are good and sincere
Catholics, many are by no means
such. Protestants have written on it,
some in favor of the doctrine (!), most
of them against it. The bitterest and
most unfair articles, however, have
been and are those written by the
political opponents of the church;
though how this precise question can
come into politics, any more than the
existence of religion, the divinity of
the Saviour, the infallibility of the
church, or any other point of doctrine,
we cannot see. But in Europe, if religion
does not go into politics, politics,
or at least politicians and political
writers, have no scruples in
going into religious matters. In fact,
the most advanced party of "<i>progress,
and enlightenment, and liberty</i>" proclaim
that there should be no religion
at all, that it narrows the intellect by
hampering freedom of thought, and
enslaves man by forbidding him to do
much that he desires; and as they
think mankind should, on the contrary,
be free from all its trammels; and as
they hold it to be their special mission
to effect this liberation, they systematically
omit no occasion of attacking
religion. For them, one point is as
good as another; the infallibility of the
pope will do as well as the discovery
that a crazy nun, subject to furious
mania, was confined in a room so
small that the sides of it only measured
twenty feet one way and twenty-three
the other, and so low that one
had to stand on a step to reach the
window. Any thing will serve this
class of writers. And, unfortunately
for religious news, much of what appears
in the press of Europe, and must
gradually be infused, in part at least,
into the press in the United States, is
from such pens, and is imbued or is
tinged with their spirit.</p>

<p>We would not do justice to Rome
and the council if we omitted to
mention a very interesting event with
which the council is connected, if
only as the occasion. We mean the
Roman Exposition of Arts, as applied
to religious purposes. It was opened
by the pope three weeks ago.</p>

<p>The traveller arriving in Rome by
the railway cannot fail to be struck
with wonder at the view which opens
before him the instant he steps out of
the door of the central station. Just
across the square, huge dark masses
of rough masonry rise before him.
Some are only twenty or thirty feet
high, and their tops are covered with
the herbage or bushes that grow on
the soil, wafted thither by the winds
of centuries. Others are still higher,
and are connected by walls equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
old, some broken, some nearly entire.
Here and there immense arches of
masonry, a hundred feet high in the
air, still span the space from pier to
pier, and bear a fringe of green herbage.
Every thing tells you of the
immensity of the building, or group of
buildings which men erected here in
ages long gone by. But even still, as
you see, portions of these walls and
arches are used. Not every pier is a
mere isolated ruin; not under every
arch can you look and see through
it a broad expanse of blue Italian sky.
Modern walls are joined to these
piers; the ancient walls too are turned
to account; irregular roofs, some high,
some low, come against them. Here,
through the high openings in the original
wall, men are busy taking in or
delivering bundles of hay from the
store-house they have constructed.
There, through doorways and windows
of more modern shape, you see that
another portion is made to serve as
barracks for soldiers. Other buildings
stretch away northward and
westward, schools, orphanages, and a
reformatory, as you see by their various
inscriptions. But though of
more recent date, they have not lost
all connection with the ruins; for the
ground all along shows traces of the
original constructions in the fragments
of broken columns and in patches of
the ancient masonry, which between
and beyond them continues ever and
anon to rise in outlying masses. But
in the centre, where the strong masonry
rises higher than elsewhere and is
best preserved, there spreads a wide
roof surmounted by crosses at the
gables. To the eastward, the ruins
seem to die away in a long and not
very high line of buildings, evidently
cared for and inhabited. The walls
are covered with plaster, and the
windows are glazed, and protected by
shutters. Over the ridge of the roof
you may see the lofty summits of
some cedars that are growing in a
court-yard or garden within.</p>

<p>These are the mighty remnants
of the Baths of Diocletian, commenced
by that emperor in the year 302.
Built at the period when Rome was
at the zenith of her wealth and luxury,
it far exceeded all other buildings
of its class in the seven-hilled city,
both in vastness and in grandeur. It
was undertaken in a time of the most
cruel persecution of the church, and
the Christians who were condemned
to imprisonment and hard labor, because
they would not deny their Lord,
were brought here day after day from
many a prison, and fettered like convicts,
and were made to labor in erecting
this pile devoted to pride, and
luxury, and debauchery. Many an
account of the martyr Christians of
that age tells of old and young men
and women, condemned for their faith,
and sent to die here a lingering death
of martyrdom. Many a soul passed
from this spot straight to heaven. For
who hath greater love than he who
giveth his life for his friend? Many
a prayer of Christian faith, of holy resignation,
of ardent hope of a better
life, was here uttered day after day,
and hour after hour, all the years the
work lasted. The antiquarian still
finds here and there the bricks which
believing hands marked with a cross,
the outward expression of the prayer
of their hearts, offering their labors
and sufferings, endured for his sake, to
Him who for their sakes labored and
suffered on the cross. It is estimated
that more than forty thousand Christians
toiled at the work. It was in
these ruins, if we mistake not, that
was found one of the marble tablets
inscribed with an encomium of Diocletian,
for having purged the world of
that vile and hateful superstition called
Christianity.</p>

<p>In this vast pile of buildings, thirteen
hundred feet from east to west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and twelve hundred from north to
south, there were halls, court-yards
surrounded by ample porticoes, pools
for swimmers, thousands of baths,
libraries, galleries of painting and
sculpture, portions set aside for philosophic
discussion, other portions for
gymnastic exercises and games, and
every thing that Roman luxury or
Roman debauchery called for, and
Roman wealth could provide.</p>

<p>The first dismantling and partial
destruction of the buildings seems to
have occurred when Alaric sacked
Rome. Yet even a century later
portions of them were still used for
the original purpose as baths.</p>

<p>It is needless to say how they suffered
still more, by alternate violence
and neglect, for many centuries afterward.
Often it was occupied by soldiers
as a stronghold, and it suffered
at their hands, as by alterations here
and there they strove to make the
place more defensible. Often it was
assailed and taken, and then suffered
still more, as whatever could be was
toppled over in anger. And when the
soldiers left it quiet, rain and winds
and storms continued the work of destruction.
In the sixteenth century
all this property was owned by Saint
Charles Borromeo. He gave it to the
pope, Pius IV., who determined to
construct a church, if possible, in the
midst of these ruins, and so put them
under the guardianship of that very
religion which gave so many martyrs
toward their construction. The pontiff
committed the task to Michael
Angelo, who executed it in a manner
which won an admiration next to that
gained by his great work at St. Peter's.</p>

<p>Amid the ruins there stood a vast
hall, three hundred and twenty-five
feet long and sixty feet broad. Its
massive walls were perfect, and the
vast arch of masonry that covered it,
at the height of over one hundred
feet, though weakened by the exposure
of centuries, still stood unbroken.
The Caldarium stood near by on one
side, and the old natatio, or swimming
room, joined it on the other. Both
still preserved their vaulted roofs.
Michael Angelo united them, and,
preserving the walls and the massive
monolith columns of red Egyptian
granite, which were all standing, skilfully
produced a noble church in the
form of a Greek cross, which is known
as St. Mary of the Angels. One loves
to pass an hour in that vast, quiet, and
attractive church, under the olden
arch, now protected from the weather
by an additional tiled roof, viewing
the exquisite statues of saints, and the
masterpieces of painting, the originals,
some of them, of the mosaics over
the altars of St. Peter's, or listening to
the Cistercian monks who serve the
church as they slowly and reverently
chant the divine office at their stated
hours of day and night.</p>

<p>On the eastern side, toward the
Pretorian Camp, war had done its
most destructive work. Here Michael
Angelo found the ruins so entirely
beaten down that most of the space
had been devoted to gardens, though
encumbered indeed by sundry picturesque
mounds of masonry. Here,
using the materials at hand so far as
they would serve, he erected a monastery
for the Cistercians, a plain
quadrangular building, inclosing an
open space about four hundred feet
square. To each side of this the
building presents a portico, or arcade,
which thus forms a cloister, supported
by twenty-five columns of travertine.
No work of that great architect and
artist exceeds this cloister in its simplicity,
and the exquisite beauty of
form and proportion in all its parts.
In the centre of the yard is a majestic,
ever-flowing fountain, throwing its
stream of water aloft. This falls into an
ample marble reservoir beneath, whose
waters ripple and sparkle in the sunlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
as the gold-fish are darting to
and fro into the shade of water-lilies
or out to court the beams of the sun.
By this basin the architect planted
with his own hand four young cedars,
which throve apace. Three of them
are still standing, historic trees. Two
are strong and vigorous, though three
centuries old; a third is in the decrepitude
of old age, shattered and broken
by the winds, but still bravely struggling
to the last to raise its topmost
branches upward toward heaven.
The fourth perished some years ago,
and has been replaced by another,
younger one, which a good Cistercian,
they say, obtained by securing
in time and carefully nursing a young
shoot of the old tree itself.</p>

<p>Around the cloister are the cells of
the brethren. They seem to have a
curious fancy of fastening placards on
their doors. You can see half a dozen
of them of different sizes. On
some doors the sheet of paper is apparently
fresh and clean, and is still
securely fastened by four tacks, or by
wafers under the corners. On other
doors some of the tacks have fallen
out, or the wafers have lost their hold,
and the paper hangs dangling by a
single corner. The winds have blown
it until it is torn. The rain has moistened
and caused it to curl. The upper
portion hangs loosely over, half
hiding the writing on it. You approach
and stretch out your hand to
lift it up, that you may read what a
Cistercian had placarded on the door
of his cell. It is all a delusion! There
is no paper! Some painter, quitting
the world, retreated to this community.
In its quietude and silence, and
in its penitential life, he found again
peace and tranquillity of soul, and the
gayety of his youth came back to
him. He took a boyish pleasure in
playing this clever artistic practical
joke on the strangers whom curiosity,
or other motives, from time to time,
brought to look at the interior of
a Carthusian monastery. He died
peacefully and piously years ago, but
the brethren have not ceased to enjoy
the joke he perpetrated.</p>

<p>What a practical lesson of the power
with which God rules the world!
In this spot where a cruel and sanguinary
emperor persecuted and martyred
Christians by the thousands,
and boasted that he had exterminated
the Christian church, the ruins of
his vast work owe their preservation
to the sacred power of a Christian
church. Where luxury, and the pride
of the world, and every form of sensuality
were wont to seek their gratification,
now meek and humble white-robed
Cistercians who have renounced
the world and its pomps and sins, and
are vowed to poverty, chastity, and
obedience, work and study in silence,
fast austerely, and make the hours of
day and the hours of night holy by
prayer and chanting of psalms. The
heathen empire of Rome has passed
away, but the church it tried to destroy
lives in perpetual youth. Rome has
lost her heathen power of ruling with
the sword the bodies of men from the
Pillars of Hercules. But through that
very Christianity Rome has received
and wields a far higher power than
the sword could give. She guides
the consciences and minds of men,
not only through the provinces of her
olden temporal empire, but beyond
their limit, in lands where the eagle of
a Roman legion was never raised, and
in countries of whose existence the
Roman emperors never dreamed. To
the thoughtful mind the Cistercian monastery
and the noble church of St.
Mary of the Angels but typify the glory
of Christian Rome, built amid the
ruins of her olden heathen power.</p>

<p>The proposal, made originally by
whom we know not, of opening an exposition
of religious art at Rome during
the sittings of the council, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
immediately taken up with enthusiasm.
His Holiness assigned the garden
of this noble cloister as the best
adapted site to be found in Rome,
except at a large expense. The Cistercians
withdrew temporarily to other
buildings close by, and gave up their
own beautiful place to architects and
workmen. The cloister, or broad open
arcade, which runs round the square
garden was chosen to form the outer
gallery or halls, altogether about
twelve hundred feet long by twenty
broad. Within this outer gallery, and
just touching each side in the middle,
is a series of sixteen rooms, all of the
same size, and of the same irregular,
or rather rhomboidal, shape, forming,
as it were, a broad polygon of sixteen
sides. Within this polygon is the
central portion of the garden, still unoccupied,
with its gravelled walks, its
green sward, its rose-trees and flowering
plants, its ever-gushing fountain,
the ample basin receiving the water,
the glistening gold-fish, and the majestic
cedars of Michael Angelo. The
arcade has, of course, its own covering.
The sixteen rooms of the polygon are
roofed with glass, to let in the flood of
light, and a few feet below the glass
is another roofing, or awning, to soften
its intensity and to mitigate the
heat of the direct rays of the sun.
Large openings in the partition walls
allow free passage from room to room,
all around the polygon; and where
it touches the arcade or outer halls,
other doors allow you to pass to them,
or by opposite doors you may pass out
to walk in the garden.</p>

<p>The exposition was opened on the
17th of February by the pope himself,
in the presence of the commission for
the exposition, a number of cardinals,
some three hundred of the bishops,
and a large concourse of clergy and
laity. He made an impromptu discourse,
touching chiefly on the true
progress which art has made under
the inspiration of religion and the
patronage of the church, and in illustration
referred to some of those unrivalled
works of religious painting and
sculpture which are found in Rome.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more appropriate
to the assembling of so many bishops
and priests and pious laymen in Rome,
drawn by the council, than this exposition.
Go when you will, you will
find many of all these classes spending
hours in studying a collection of
religious works of every kind, such
as most of them have never seen. In
size and extent this exposition cannot,
of course, compare with those vast
ones of London and Paris. They
sought and received objects of every
kind. This admits nothing that is
not devoted to, or in some way connected
with, religion. It would correspond,
therefore, with one section of
the Paris Exposition of 1867. Considered
in this light, it does not, as a
whole, fall below it; in several respects
it is superior.</p>

<p>We have not the space now to enter
into a detail of the many and multifarious
objects offered for examination.
Every art seems represented. For
what is there that cannot be made
to give glory to God? Still, we may
glance at a few of the chief groups.</p>

<p>The exterior arcade is chiefly devoted
to sculpture and paintings. Of
the former there are here and elsewhere
in the exhibition over two hundred
and fifty pieces, in marble, in
plaster, or metal, or wood. I do not
count the hundreds of sweet little
things in terra cotta, nor the many
objects in ivory. Tadolini, Benzoni,
Pettrich, and a hundred other artists
from Rome, and other parts of Italy,
Germany, and France, have sent the
work of their chisels. As a whole,
this group of subjects stands far higher
in point of good art than was looked
for. Some of the statues are of a
high order. We may instance a group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of heroic size by Tadolini, representing
the Archangel Michael overcoming
Lucifer, after the painting by Guido,
and two life-size Madonnas by Pettrich,
all of which, we understand, will be
forwarded to the United States. There
is in one of the French rooms a plaster
copy of the statue of the holy Vianney,
curate of the village of Ars, near
Lyons, in France, who died a few
years ago in the odor of sanctity,
and who, the Catholics of France are
confident, will in due time be canonized.
He is robed in soutane, surplice,
and stole, and is kneeling in prayer, his
face turned upward toward heaven.
I do not speak of the style and execution,
which are good; but of the face,
which attracts every one. It is said
to be a perfect likeness. Thin, gaunt,
with features sharp and exaggerated
by the lack of flesh, rather ugly than
otherwise, there is an expression of
simplicity, of piety, of kindness, of
earnestness, which makes it far more
than beautiful, a face that grows in
sweetness as you look on it. And
yet study the individual features, forehead,
eyebrows, nose, mouth, chin,
cheek-bones, the chief lines and wrinkles.
They are precisely the same
as on the repulsive face of Voltaire!
What different expressions were given
to the same features by the calm piety,
the love of God and our neighbor,
the spiritual peace dwelling in the
soul of the saintly priest, and the
pride, and envy, and passions, and
the bitter, hopeless or despairing unbelief
of the apostle of evil.</p>

<p>As we examine these statues, so
good in their execution and so truly
religious in their type, one cannot but
feel a regret that in the United States
we are such strangers to the use of
them in our churches and chapels and
oratories. Here and there are found,
indeed, casts in plaster of Paris, sometimes
in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papier-machÃ©</i>. But how few
real works of merit in materials and
in style! If the clergy who are at
work building our churches, and some
of the laymen who are seconding them
in this work, could only see those statues
of our Lord on the cross, or bearing
the cross and sinking under its
weight, or healing the blind, or blessing
little children; or those sweet ones
of the Mother and Divine Child, in
various positions; or of the Blessed
Virgin, of St. Joseph, of Saint Cecilia,
Saint Agnes, and of so many other
saints and groups representing religious
subjects; surely among them,
in marble, in iron, bronzed, silvered,
gilt, or illuminated with polychrome,
and such a variety in size and in cost,
they would understand the void in our
churches, and would each do his part
to supply it.</p>

<p>Especially would this be the case
with the stations of the way of the
cross. No devotion is more tender
and consoling, and at the same time
none more strengthening to true piety
and the practice of virtue, than
this pilgrimage of faith, in which we
accompany our Lord, and, as it were,
stand by his side, during the several
scenes of his sufferings down to his
death on the cross and his burial.
No devotion is more popular, because
none better suited to the faithful of
every condition and class. Would it
not be well if the engravings of those
different scenes, so often found&mdash;we
had almost said, disfiguring the walls
of our churches, could give way to
some of those basso-relievos and alto-relievos
of France, of Italy, and
of Germany, such as we see here?
The love of the beautiful and striking is
innate in man. Even the child feels
it; and in manhood, use and education
but develop and increase the satisfaction
it gives. While we smiled, we
could not but sympathize in some
measure with the Italian sculptor
who, on his dying-bed, pushed away
a crucifix which a pious attendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
wished to place in his hands. "Not
that, not that! it makes me angry," he
said; "it is horrid! Give me the other
one; it is well made. That will excite
devotion." Let children be taught,
in a way they will love, to think
often, to know, to realize, even from
their tenderest years, what the loving
and merciful Saviour suffered for
man. Lessons well learned at that
tender and innocent age seldom fade
from the mind and heart in after
years. And no way of teaching that
lesson is more effectual than the one
we indicate.</p>

<p>There are more than five hundred
paintings in the exposition. Of these
perhaps two hundred are by the old
masters, and have been placed here
by their owners.</p>

<p>These embrace paintings by the
divine Raffaele, as the Italians call
him, Domenichino, Annibale Carracci,
Correggio, Maratta, Carlo Dolce, Salvator
Rosa, Murillo, Leonardo da
Vinci, Guido Reni, Rubens, Vandyke,
Ribeyra, Del Sarto, and a host of
other old masters, Italian, German,
Flemish, and Spanish, whom we need
not name. There we may gaze with
rapture on the excellence of art inspired
by religious thought. It is a
fact not to be overlooked or forgotten,
in these days of irreligion, that the
best paintings which the best artists
ever painted were all produced when
they brought their powers to represent
a religious subject. In painting, and
in other things too, he works best who
works in the spirit of religion and the
fear of God.</p>

<p>The larger number of the paintings
are of later date, many of them by
living artists. To our eye, certainly
not trained to criticism, many of them
appear worthy of high praise. But
we believe the general verdict is not
so favorable to them as to the statuary.
Still, we must remember that
here they have to compete side by
side with those old paintings of the
highest order. The contrast between
their freshly laid colors and the colors
of older paintings, toned down by age,
if not somewhat faded, is so strong
and striking that this very difference,
often no real difference on the part
of the painters, is set down as a
defect to be censured. The portrait
of the pope, by our American artist
Healy, is undoubtedly the best likeness
of the Holy Father in the exposition.</p>

<p>What we said of the statuary we
may repeat with equal reason of religious
paintings. How easy it would
be to adorn our churches and chapels
with these books of the eye, one glance
at which often teaches more than a
sermon. The artists at home capable
of producing a religious painting
worthy of being placed in a church
are few, perhaps might be counted
on one's fingers. European painters
capable of giving an original ask
such prices for their work as generally
to put them as far beyond our
means as if they were to be painted
at home. Even at that, their conception
and treatment of a subject will
scarcely stand comparison with approved
works of the best masters who
have already treated the same subjects.
But there is a large class of
painters here who devote themselves
to copying and reproducing those old
paintings, on every scale as to size.
The execution of many of them is
good, and the prices for which the
artists are willing to work seem
very low. It is wonderful how much
painting, and good painting, five hundred
dollars well laid out in Rome
will obtain. Several of our clerical
friends, who have visited Rome
this winter, carry back with them evidences
of this fact.</p>

<p>Next to the paintings should come
the stained glass, which is superb,
and is offered at a price which seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
really astonishing&mdash;about five dollars
a square foot for the richest kind, with
life-size figures.</p>

<p>The large windows, from several
competing manufacturers, are so
mounted that the light shines through
them, and you can examine at full
leisure and carefully the wondrous
effects of united brilliancy and softness
in these works of peculiarly
Christian art. The art of painting on
glass, which many, up to a recent
period, thought entirely lost, has revived
in this century, and seems fast
approaching the perfection which it
attained in the middle ages. There
is one marked difference observable
between the old windows and some
of the work here. The ancients displayed
their skill in combining together
thousands of minute pieces of
glass of different colors, so as to make
up a picture in its proper colors and
its lights and shadows. The modern
artists have attempted the task of
producing the picture on a single
large sheet of glass. This would free
it from the single defect almost unavoidable
in this work&mdash;the stiffness
of the figures. But the earlier attempts
presented such variation in the
perfections of the several colors used
as to be failures, in point of that brilliancy
and play of light which constitute
the charm of this work. The
source of the defect was to be found
in the laws of nature, on which every
work, and this work directly, depends.
The general mode of procedure in
which glass is colored is this: The
subject is painted on the surface of a
sheet of glass with metallic paints.
The glass is placed in an oven and
slowly and carefully raised to that point
of heat at which it grows soft. The
particles of metal constituting the colors
sink into the glass and become
portions of its substance. The difficulty
was found to spring from the
great difference in the rate and manner
in which the colors would sink
into the softened substance. What
would give some colors perfectly,
would leave others imperfect; and
continuing the work until these were
perfect, would often destroy the first.
But patient study and careful work
have overcome these difficulties to a
degree which we did not expect.
There are full-size figures here in
stained glass rivalling those of the
middle ages in brilliancy, and possessing
the freedom of a painting on canvas.</p>

<p>The perfection of the Gobelins tapestry
is almost incredible. A large
canvas, twenty-five feet by ten, presents
the Assumption by Titian, and near it
is a life-size figure of our Lord in the
tomb. It is a sermon but to look on
the cold, rigid body of him who bore
our transgressions. There are specimens
of photography, some showing
life-size figures, of oleography, lithography,
chromo-lithography, engravings
on copper, for which Rome cannot
be excelled, on steel, and on wood.
In many of these branches France
and Germany rival, if they do not surpass
Italy. But Rome stands unrivalled
in mosaics, of which there are
here exquisite specimens.</p>

<p>In architecture, we find plans of
churches and colleges, very full and
clear, but not striking; designs for the
interior of chapels and sanctuaries, of
a far higher order of art, several miniatures
of churches; a fac-simile in white
marble of the front of St. Peter's,
and another in wood, on the scale of
about one inch to ten feet, showing
the entire exterior of the church front
and dome in all its details, the colonnades,
fountains, and square before
it, and so constructed that it can be
opened in several ways, in order to
give an equally correct and minute
view of the interior with all its ornamentation.
You may recognize every
painting and statue in the basilica.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
It took years of patient labor to make
this model, and it is said to have
been sold to an Italian prince for
twenty thousand dollars. What a
pity such a work should be shut up
in some palace in the city where every
one can go to the real St. Peter's.
It should rather be sent to distant
countries, where thousands, who will
never go to Rome, might be able to
obtain from it a far clearer conception
than any books can give of the form
and splendor of this great temple,
which is deservedly the pride and the
glory of the Christian world.</p>

<p>In music, there are organs with the
latest and best improvements, harmoniums,
Alexandre organs of various
powers and many stops, and chimes
and church-bells hung on a new patent
system, by which a mere boy can
swing easily and ring loudly a bell of
nearly a ton weight. As for texts of
church music, you may turn over the
parchment leaves of huge folio graduals
and antiphonaries, in which the
good old monks of past ages wrote
the Gregorian notes and the words so
large and so clear as to be easily read
in the choir, even at the distance of
ten feet. There are later ones printed
nearly as large, and collections of
modern church music from Italy, Germany,
and from France.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical vestments abound in
the exposition. Rome, Milan, and
other cities of Italy are represented
by the most celebrated of their manufacturers.
France has sent a multitude
from Paris, Lyons, Grenoble,
Montpellier, Nismes, and elsewhere.
Others have come from Germany and
from Spain. Here are copes and chasubles,
dalmatics, antipendiums, and
veils, of the richest material and exquisite
workmanship. You can examine
the ample yet light and pliable
vestments of Italy, the rich and stiffer
ones of France, the narrow and scantier
form of Austria, and the heavier
ones from Spain, that ought never to
wear out. In the matter of vestments
you are taught a lesson of history.
For here, carefully preserved in large
glass wardrobes, are shown the vestments
used six hundred and eight
hundred years ago, if not a thousand
years ago, in St. Peter's, in St. Mary
Major's, in St. John Lateran's, and in
the cathedral of Anagni.</p>

<p>The emperors of the Holy Roman
Empire, as it was called, which sprung
into existence in the ninth century,
and died in the convulsions of Europe
consequent on the French revolution,
were bound to come, if circumstances
allowed it, to Rome, to receive their
royal consecration in St. Peter's at the
hands of the pope. On such occasions,
the emperor was admitted for that
time into the sanctuary, wore a deacon's
dalmatic, and chanted a gospel.
Here you may look at the identical
dalmatic which they wore a thousand
years ago. It is of silk, and the
figures which decorate it were worked
with the needle, in gold thread. Near
by are copes, and chasubles, and mitres
faded and worn; which still give
evidence of the art and care in making
them, the richness of the materials
used, and of the skill of the embroidery
and painting which decorated
them. What will the modern chasubles
and copes around us, now so
fresh and splendid, look like in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
2500?</p>

<p>Church vessels of every class are
equally abundant. Chalices, pixes,
cruets, censers, incense-cups, crosses,
crucifixes, ostensories, croziers, every
thing that can be thought of, are here,
often in their richest forms. There
are chapelles for priests, and chapelles
for bishops. Altar candlesticks and
candelabra of every size and graceful
form tempt you. Perhaps the most
interesting in a scientific and also a
pecuniary view, is the large collection
of all those vessels made of bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
aluminium, of a light gold color, and
not liable to tarnish. The weight is
light, and the prices low.</p>

<p>There are altars of marble, of cast-iron,
of bronze gilt, and of wood colored
and illuminated, the last-named
truly beautiful, and they would well
replace some of those far more costly
constructions sometimes to be met in
our churches.</p>

<p>Altars lead us to candelabra, candlesticks,
and chandeliers; and here
they are displayed in every size, from
an immense chandelier to be suspended
in a church, of metal gilt, ornamented
with angels and religious emblems,
and bearing sixty-five lights,
down to the tasteful bongie, or tiny candlestick
which an acolyth holds in his
hand when he attends a bishop at the
altar. Altar candlesticks and candelabra
seem a specialty with the French
artists. The graceful curve of the outlines,
the appropriateness and suggestiveness
of the decoration, and the
ease with which all these pieces may
be combined to produce on the altar
a whole simple and tasteful, or rich
and splendid, can scarcely be conceived.
They bring to their work the
spirit of the children of Israel in the
desert, offering their gold and jewels
to Moses for the ornamentation of
the tabernacle of the Most High.
Man can never do too much to testify
his homage and his loving obedience
to God.</p>

<p>In Christian bibliography the chief
Catholic publishers have done well.
The polyglott press of the Propaganda
exhibits many of its late publications;
among others an accurate <i>fac-simile</i>
of the Codex Vaticanus of the
Scriptures, and a volume containing
the Lord's Prayer in two hundred
and fifty languages, in the proper characters
of each language, where it has
any. The volume presents one hundred
and eighty different forms of
type. Salviucci, of Rome; Pustet, of
Ratisbon; Dessain, of Malines, and
many others exhibit well printed and
richly bound copies of their chief publications.
Vecco &amp; Co., of Turin,
show the eighteen volumes they have
already printed of the new edition of
the <cite>Magnum Bullarium</cite>. Victor PalmÃ©,
of Paris, displays an enormous
line of folio volumes, the <cite>Acta Sanctorum</cite>
of the great Bollandists, the republication
of which he has just finished
in fifty-eight volumes. To this
he adds his edition of the <cite>Ideologia</cite>,
by the professors of Salamanca, his
<cite>Gallia Christiana</cite>, his edition of <cite>Annales
Baronii</cite>, and the introductory
volume of a new edition of the <cite>Collectio
Maxima Conciliorum</cite>, which he
has just commenced.</p>

<p>It was sad not to find the veteran
Migne here, and to think of that sad
conflagration which consumed the work
of a lifetime. He had undertaken, and
after fifty years of steady persevering
labor, was finishing the greatest bibliographical
achievement of the publishers
of this century. The twelve
or thirteen hundred large volumes he
had published in his collection, embracing
all the fathers, Greek and Latin,
ample courses of Scripture, theology,
and canon law, encyclopÃ¦dias,
history, theologians, preachers, etc.,
would have presented the largest and
most imposing array of volumes&mdash;almost
a complete theological library in
itself. Great as was his loss, that to
the clergy was greater.</p>

<p>We mention last a collection which
every visitor to the exposition hurries
to see first, as most deserving of his
attention, the collection of articles
which the Holy Father himself directed
should be sent here from the Sixtine
Chapel: 1. The famous tiara presented
to him by the Queen of Spain.
The three crowns on it are of brilliants
and pearls, the roses are rubies
and emeralds, the ball on the summit
is of rubies, and the cross above of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
diamonds. As a work of art, it is
considered a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of grace
and elegance, and does honor to the
artists of Spain. 2. A chalice of gold
covered with brilliants and diamonds.
These diamonds and brilliants were
a present from Mehemet Ali. 3. A
large golden ostensory, of Byzantine
style, the rays of which are studded
with brilliants, from the same donor.
4. A large processional cross of gold,
the staff of silver gilt. The cross is of
an elegantly flowering Gothic form,
and is adorned with precious stones
and enamel. It was made to order
in France, and is a present from the
Marquis of Bute. Chalices, mitres,
vestments, cruets, an ancient <span class="smcap lowercase">MS.</span> missal,
exquisitely illuminated and richly
bound, with many other objects, make
up a large list of articles which His
Holiness has sent to give additional
interest to the exposition. Others
have acted in the same spirit; and
certainly, if the number, the richness,
and the exquisite taste and elegance
of the articles displayed can effect it,
the exposition is a success. The attendance
has been pretty fair, and as
the governmental outlay has been but
small, may prove remunerative. The
exhibitors will certainly succeed in introducing
their works to the religious
world far more generally than they
could have ordinarily looked for. And
the visitors seem all satisfied that each
repeated visit to the exposition is a
renewed and increased pleasure. We
may perhaps endeavor next month to
be able to write more at length of the
more prominent articles in the exposition,
with reference to the needs of
our American churches.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">An Essay in Aid of a Grammar of
Assent.</span> By John Henry Newman,
D.D. 1 vol. 12mo. New York:
The Catholic Publication Society.
1870.</p>

<p>It would be quite impossible without
exceeding proper limits to give any thing
more than an incomplete sketch of the
plan of this able work; it must, of course,
be read in full to be appreciated.</p>

<p>At the outset three states of mind
are distinguished, assent, inference, and
doubt, corresponding to the external actions
of assertion, conclusion, and interrogation,
though not necessarily accompanying
them. The subject of the
essay is, as its name implies, principally
the first of these; doubt being merely
alluded to, and inference treated in its
relation to assent, and only that species
being considered at length which is not
strictly demonstrative. The various
modes in which assent exists, and in
which it is formed, are the first objects
of examination.</p>

<p>The division made here of assent, and
which recurs throughout the work, is
into real and notional, the former relating
to propositions whose terms, in the
words of the author, "stand for things
external to us, unit and individual," the
latter "for what is abstract, general, and
non-existing;" and this last is distinguished
under the names of profession,
credence, opinion, presumption, and speculation,
which terms are necessarily
used in senses somewhat different from
those ordinarily attached to them.</p>

<p>The strength of real assents in comparison
to notional ones is shown, and
the difference in this point of view between
assent and inference; the latter
being clearest in purely abstract matters.
Not but that assent is always unconditional
or absolute; still, its material,
when real, is so much more vividly
apprehended that the assent elicited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
is much more energetic and operative.
Thus also when notional assents become
real, as they may in consequence of
some special circumstances, their hold
upon the mind and control upon action
is much increased.</p>

<p>This subject is illustrated by a discussion
of religious assents, with special
reference to the being of God, and to
the Holy Trinity; it is shown that the
former truth, and the constituent parts
of the latter, can be, and usually are, the
objects of real assent, though the latter
in its completeness or unity can only be
notionally apprehended; and though the
definition of the Divine Being may give
only a notional idea. The implicit assent
which unlearned Christians give to
all the definitions of the church is also
explained.</p>

<p>The absolute and unconditional character
of assent is next treated, and it
is shown that it has this character even
when given without good grounds, or
when those grounds are forgotten; and
that it is not necessarily conceded to
convincing proofs, and may disappear
while the inference which led to it still
remains. Without this character the act
is not assent at all, or at least is only
that notional form of it called by the
author opinion, which he defines as assent
to the probable truth of a proposition.
The possibility and continual
occurrence of full assent without intuition
or demonstration is defended against
those who, though really they have no
doubt about some theoretically uncertain
matters, yet "think it a duty to remind
us that, since the full etiquette of logical
requirements has not been satisfied,
we must believe those truths at our
peril."</p>

<p>The distinction is drawn between
simple or unconscious assent and the
conscious, reflex, or complex assent, as
the author calls it, which, when the
thing believed is true, has the name of
certitude, and is irreversible or indefectible.
In simple assent we do not
give any place, or in any way incline
mentally to the opposite belief, though
we may examine the grounds of our
own for various reasons; but when we
are certain, we explicitly refuse to admit
any thing opposed to it. The occurrence
of false or supposed certitudes does not
suffice to prove the non-existence of
real ones; and certitude is not to be
confounded with infallibility, which is a
faculty applicable "to all possible propositions
in a given subject matter,"
while certitude is "directed to this or
that particular proposition."</p>

<p>The next part is the discussion of the
act of inference. In its most perfect or
formal state it can be used without limitation
only upon abstractions; it "comes
short of proof in concrete matters, because
it has not a full command over the
objects to which it relates, but merely
assumes its premises." Hence, even
when what we do assume is true, as
shown in an earlier part of the work,
processes of inference in concrete matters
may easily end in mysteries. In
many cases it cannot profitably be used,
owing to the labor required for taking
account of all the circumstances, as
well as the real difference of the first
principles from which our syllogisms
proceed. We are, therefore, obliged to
resort to informal inference, in which arguments
and probabilities are estimated
in the mass, and have a different force to
different individuals, according to the
character in them of what Dr. Newman
calls the illative sense. He concludes
by treating of the exercise of this combining
and directing faculty in its application
to religious inferences, both in natural
and revealed religion, and shows
that by means of it we may fairly arrive
at certitude regarding Christianity, and
that such a method is at least as likely
to succeed as more formal demonstrations.
The lawfulness and reasonableness
of assent in religious matters, as
well as in others, without such demonstrations,
may be regarded as one of the
main objects of the work, though by no
means its only one.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">De l'UnitÃ© dans l'Enseignement
de la Philosophie au Sein des
Ecoles Catholiques d'aprÃ¨s les
Recentes Decisions des Congregations
Romaines.</span> Par le P. H.
RamiÃ¨re, S.J. Paris, 1862.</p>

<p>F. RamiÃ¨re is well known as the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of the admirable confraternity of "The
Apostleship of Prayer," and the author
of a number of excellent works on spiritual
subjects, and also on the great religious
questions of the day. We have
recently been indebted to him for some
extremely able essays in defence of the
rights of the Holy See, for which he
has received the eulogium of the Holy
Father himself. The work whose title
is given above has been sent to us by the
reverend father himself, we presume on
account of the article translated, with
some preliminary observations of our
own, from F. Vercellone, on the ideology
of St. Augustine, which appeared in a
recent number; and we beg to thank
him for his kindness. We had not before
had the pleasure of reading it, although
it has been eight years published.
We have read it with attention, and, we
are happy to say, with much satisfaction.
The learning and logical force of the
author command our respect, and his
calmness, candor, impartiality, and truly
Christian charity win our esteem,
throughout the whole course of his argument.
The argument is divided into
three parts. In the first part, the author
sustains the possibility and the great
importance of unity in philosophical
instruction, and lays down the conditions
by which it can be obtained. In
all that he says under this head we fully
and cordially concur with him. In the
second part, he discusses traditionalism;
and here again we find ourselves in perfect
agreement with all his positions.
In the third part, he attacks the grand
difficulty of the origin of rational cognition,
and, of course, discusses the vexed
question of ontologism. It would be a
futile effort to attempt a critical appreciation
of this part of F. RamiÃ¨re's
work in a brief critical notice, and we
will not attempt it. An opinion on these
very grave and much controverted topics,
in order to be worth attention,
must be supported by elaborate arguments,
and based on deep and patient
study of all the principal authors, ancient
and modern, whose works are the
great sources of philosophical knowledge.
We agree perfectly with F.
RamiÃ¨re, that thorough discussion, carried
on in the spirit of moderation, directed
by a pure love of truth, and regulated
by obedience to the authority of
the church, is the only road by which
we can attain to that degree of unity in
philosophical doctrines which prevails
among all truly orthodox theologians
in respect to dogmatic and moral theology.
We desire to see this discussion
go on, and hope for a good result
from it; and as a necessary preparation,
we cannot too earnestly insist on
the necessity of a more thorough study
of scholastic philosophy than has been
common among those who have written
on these subjects in the English language.
Both in theology and philosophy,
we hold it as certain that we must
follow the great fathers and doctors of
the church as our guides and masters,
or go astray and lose our labor.
The essential truths of philosophy must
be contained in that system which the
church authorizes, and in which she
trains up her clergy.</p>

<p>As we understand them, there is no
difference between F. Vercellone and
F. RamiÃ¨re on this point. We are not
authorized to speak for Dr. Brownson,
who is the great philosophical writer
among American Catholics; but we think
he would agree with us fully in this judgment;
and that the passage in a contrary
sense, quoted by F. RamiÃ¨re, is to
be regarded as one of those <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter dicta</i>
which his mature, deliberate wisdom
would not ratify. We cheerfully acknowledge
that the doctrine which F.
RamiÃ¨re so lucidly exposes as the Thomistic
doctrine of the origin of cognition
is sufficient as a basis of rational certitude
and natural theology, and we are
perfectly agreed with him that this is
the main point to be secured. As for
the profound and difficult, and therefore
intensely interesting and attractive, questions
which relate to the nature of the
intellectual light itself, and the objective
truth seen by its aid, it does not seem
to us that they have yet been as
thoroughly discussed as they need to
be, in order to bring the various schools
into a closer agreement. This is certainly
so as respects philosophy in the
English language, which is yet in its
cradle, and we think it is true universally.
Of course, the great question to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
be settled at the outset is, how far the
boundary of philosophical doctrine, as
rendered certain by the consent of the
great doctors, intrinsic evidence, and the
decisions of the supreme ecclesiastical
authority, extends; and where opinion
begins. The true understanding of the
famous decisions of 1861 is absolutely
necessary to this end, so far as ideology
is concerned; and F. RamiÃ¨re has given
an explanation of their sense and intention
which perfectly agrees with that of
F. Vercellone in a supplement to the article
which we translated. It is, namely,
the intuition of the essence of God, and
created things in that essence, as the
natural, intellectual light of reason,
which we are forbidden to affirm.</p>

<p>Are we, therefore, required, as an only
alternative, to adopt the Peripatetic philosophy
as taught by the Thomists? It
would seem that this has not yet been
sufficiently proved. The works of Gerdil,
Vercellone, and others, who profess
to find in Plato, St. Augustine, St. Bonaventure,
St. Anselm, and other great
authors, a philosophical wisdom which
supplies a want not fully satisfied by
St. Thomas, have not yet been marked
by any note of disapprobation. It
is true that F. RamiÃ¨re tells us that
Gerdil changed his opinions in his later
years. But F. Vercellone denies this,
on the authority of Cardinal Lambruschini.
F. RamiÃ¨re is extremely tolerant
of opinions differing from his own,
where he thinks he has only a greater
probability on his side. He does not
censure the following of these great
authors, or discourage the study of
them; but he thinks they are misunderstood,
and that a better study of them
would result in making us all Peripatetics
and Thomists. Let us by all
means, then, especially those who have
youth, strength, and leisure, study the
old masters of philosophy more deeply
than we have done, and truth and unity
will be the gainers. F. RamiÃ¨re protests
strongly, however, against the high esteem
which some Catholic writers have
expressed for Gioberti. As it happens
that one of our correspondents has done
the same in the present number, we feel
bound to assure F. RamiÃ¨re, and our
readers generally, that we detest, as
much as any one can, the rebellious
conduct of Gioberti toward the sovereign
pontiff, that we have no sympathy with
his hatred of the Jesuits, and condemn
every thing in his works which the Holy
See intended to censure when they
were placed on the Index. Nevertheless,
as F. Perrone has had the generosity
to place his name on the list of
illustrious Catholic writers, we do not
think it improper to give him credit for
the genius he undoubtedly possessed, or
the true and elevated teachings which
his works may contain. Even if the
worst things said against him be true,
there is no reason why we should not
make use of every thing good in his
works, as we do in those of Tertullian,
Photius, and the Port Royal divines.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we recommend and applaud
F. RamiÃ¨re's essay as a specimen
of that kind of discussion which he so
strongly advocates, with the most ardent
sympathy in his desire that sound
philosophy may go hand in hand with
theology, to deliver the world from the
destructive influence of scepticism, sophistry,
and every species of error.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Guyot's Geographical Series.</span> By
Professor Arnold Guyot. New York:
Charles Scribner &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Since Humboldt gave his scientific
facts to the world, and Ritter generalized
upon them, the study of geography has
been converted from an exercise of the
memory upon unrelated facts to a science
whose laws of mutual dependence
of cause and effect hold good in common
with other physical sciences. But it
has remained for the American mind to
generalize the later scientific discoveries
of Maury, Hugh Miller, Livingstone,
Kane, and others, and, adding them to
former achievements, give the results
in the modern school geographies. The
very number of these text-books presented
by aspiring authors and publishers
to the public is an encouraging
symptom to the lover of improvement in
knowledge, though sadly annoying to
the practical teacher, who is so frequently
urged to change the text-books in the
hands of his pupils.</p>

<p>The series before us is evidently the
result of the profoundest research united
to a practical knowledge of the best
manner of presenting facts to young
minds. None but an enthusiast in physical
science, a good expounder of original
ideas, and a polished English
scholar could have given so complete a
series of text-books to our schools and
teachers. The language in which the
facts are presented is one of the chief
recommendations of the books; for nothing
more certainly impresses itself upon
the youthful mind than the language
of the text-books used in schools, affecting
the habits of thought and expression
in all after-life. With a view also to
the varied peoples among whom these
books would be adopted, and in answer
to the demands of the age and period,
a world-wide and catholic spirit seemed
to animate the author when treating the
subject of the governments and religions
of different sections and political divisions.
Facts, as generally understood,
are fairly stated. Opinions based upon
those facts judiciously withheld. Some
improvements might be made in the
execution of the maps, and also in the
text of the primary book, the style of
which is weak and careless compared
with the rest of the series. But the illustrations,
and print, and style of getting
up are equal, if not superior, to any
books of the kind published.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Statutes of the Second Synod of
the Diocese of Albany.</span> 1869.
Troy: Scribner &amp; Co. Received
from P. J. Dooley, 182 River street,
Troy.</p>

<p>We have read this beautifully printed
document with great pleasure, and we
will cite several of the statutes, which
have in our opinion a special importance,
giving, however, only their import
in our own language, without quoting
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbatim</i> the Latin text, which is easily
accessible to those who are interested
in ecclesiastical matters.</p>

<p>1. Confessors and pastors are commanded
to teach their spiritual children
the evil and danger of attending the
sermons and religious exercises of sectarians,
and not to permit it under any
pretext.</p>

<p>2. The faithful, especially heads of
families, are admonished to exclude non-Catholic
versions of the Bible, and all
kinds of noxious books and papers, from
their houses, and to make use of good
and Catholic books and periodicals.</p>

<p>3. All who are concerned in the publication
of books relating to religion and
the divine worship are admonished not
to venture to publish any thing without
the license of the ordinary. The desire
is also expressed that clergymen will
not publish any thing whatever without
the previous consent of the bishop. It
is announced that several members of
the episcopal council will be designated
as censors of books. In the recent bull
of Pope Pius IX., abrogating all previous
laws inflicting the censure of excommunication
reserved to the pope, and promulgating
anew the causes of incurring
this censure, the authors and publishers
of books <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de rebus sacris</i>, who put forth
such books without the permission of
the ordinary, are declared to incur the
censure of excommunication <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">latÃ¦ sententiÃ¦</i>.
It is, therefore, of the utmost
importance that regulations should be
made and published in every diocese,
prescribing to authors and publishers
the conditions under which the ordinary
permits the publication of books <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de rebus
sacris</i>, and the Bishop of Albany has
given an excellent example, which we
hope will be universally followed.</p>

<p>4. The faithful are to be seasonably
exhorted to sustain the sovereign pontiff
in maintaining his temporal authority by
their contributions.</p>

<p>5. Pastors are earnestly exhorted to
use earnest efforts to extirpate the vice
of intemperance, which is the cause of
such immense scandals.</p>

<p>6. The necessity of sustaining Catholic
schools, and the dangers of theatrical
exhibitions, immodest dances, and festive
amusements or exhibitions intended
for the benefit of pious causes, such
as picnics, fairs, and excursions, are noticed.</p>

<p>7. Priests will be subjected to an annual
examination <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in scriptis</i>, before theological
examiners, during the first five
years after their ordination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>8. The faithful are to be sedulously
warned and exhorted not to contract
mixed marriages.</p>

<p>These are only a few of the great
number of excellent statutes, entirely in
accordance with the decrees of general
councils, the plenary and provincial
councils of the United States, and the
decrees of the Apostolic See, enacted by
this admirable synod, which is indeed
worthy of the best days of the church.</p>

VOL. XI., No. 63.&mdash;JUNE, 1870.</p>

<h2>MR. FROUDE'S HISTORY OF ENGLAND.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></h2>

<p>If we accept general encomium
and popular demand as criteria of
excellence, it is evident that Mr.
Froude must be the first historian of
the period. That, with a vivid pen,
he possesses a style at once clear and
graphic; that his fulness of knowledge
and skill in description are exceptional;
that his phrase is brilliant,
his analysis keen, and that with ease
and spirit, grace and energy, pictorial
and passionate power, he combines
consummate art in imagery and diction,
we have been told so often and
by so many writers that it would seem
churlish not to accord him very high
merit. Then, too, Mr. Froude is very
much in earnest. Whatever he does
he does with all his might, and in his
enthusiasm often fairly carries his reader
along with him.</p>

<p>But, in common with those who
seek, not literary excitement, but the
facts of history, we go at once to the
vital question, Is the work truthful?
Is it impartial? If not, its author's
gifts are perverted, his attainments
abused, and their fruits, so bright and
attractive to the eye, are filled with
ashes.</p>

<p>Impartial! Difficult indeed, is the
attainment of that admirable equilibrium
of judgment which secures perfect
fairness of decision, and whose
essential condition precedent is the
thorough elimination of personal preference
and party prejudice. And
here is the serious obstacle in writing
a history of England; for there are
few, very few, of the great historical
questions of the sixteenth century that
have not left to us living men of to-day
a large legacy of hopes, doubts,
and prejudices&mdash;nowhere so full of
vitality as in England, and in countries
of English tongue. Not that
we mean to limit such a difficulty to
one nation or to one period; for it
is not certain that we free ourselves
from the spell of prejudice by taking
refuge in a more remote age.
It might be thought that, in proportion
as we go back toward antiquity,
leaving behind us to-day's interests,
the historian's impartiality would become
perfect. And yet, there are few
writers of whom even this is true. Reverting
historically to the cradle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Christianity, it cannot be asserted of
Gibbon.</p>

<p>Nor can it be said even of modern
historians of nations long extinct, in
common with which one might suppose
the people of this century had
not a single prejudice. Take, for instance,
all the English historians of
ancient Greece, whose works (that
of Grote being an honorable exception)
are so many political pamphlets
arguing for oligarchy against democracy,
elevating Sparta at the sacrifice
of Athens, and thrusting at a
modern republic through the greatest
of the Hellenic commonwealths. If
Merivale is thought to treat Roman
history with impartiality, the same
cannot be said of many modern European
writers, who, disguising modern
politics in the ancient toga and
helmet, cannot discuss the Roman
imperial period without attacking the
CÃ¦sars of Paris, St. Petersburg, and
Berlin.</p>

<p>The great religious questions which
agitated England in the sixteenth century
are not dead. They still live,
and for the Anglican, the Puritan, and
the Catholic have all the deep interest
of a family history. It might,
therefore, be unreasonable to demand
from Mr. Froude a greater degree of
dispassionate inquiry and calm treatment
of subjects that were "burning
questions" in the days of Henry and
Elizabeth, than we find in Milman
and Gillies, when they discuss the
political life of Athens and LacedÃ¦mon.
So far from exacting it, we
should be disposed to be most liberal
in the allowance of even a strongly
expressed bias. But after granting
all this, and even more, we might yet
not unreasonably demand a system
which is not a paradox, a show at
least of fairness, and a due regard
for the proprieties of historical treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude's first four volumes present
the history of half the reign of
Henry VIII., a prince "chosen by
Providence to conduct the Reformation,"
and abolish the iniquities of the
papal system.</p>

<p>The historical Tudor king known
of all men before the advent of Mr.
Froude with his modern appliances
of hero-worship and muscular Christianity,
"melted so completely" in
our new historian's hands that his
despotism, persecution, diplomatic assassinations,
confiscations, divorces,
legalized murders, bloody vagrancy
laws, tyranny over conscience, and
the blasphemous assumption of spiritual
supremacy are made to appear
as the praiseworthy measures of an
ascetic monarch striving to regenerate
his country and save the world.</p>

<p>There was such a sublimity of impudence
in a paradox presented with
so much apparently sincere vehemence
that most readers were struck with
dumb astonishment. A fascinated
few declared the deodorized infamy
perfectly pure. Some, pleased with
pretty writing, were delighted with
poetic passages about "daisies," and
"destiny," "wild spirits" and "August
suns" that "shone in autumn."
Many liked its novelty, some admired
its daring, and some there were who
looked upon the thing as an enormous
joke. All these formed the great
body of readers.</p>

<p>Others there were, though, who declined
to accept results which were
violations of morality, and verdicts
against evidence obtained by systematic
vilification of some of the best,
and the elevation of some of the worst
men who ever lived, and by a blind
idolatry incapable of discerning flaw
or stain in the unworthy object of its
worship; who saw Mr. Froude's multifarious
ignorance of matters essential
for a historian to know, and his
total want of that judicial quality of
mind, without which no one, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
though possessed of all knowledge,
can ever be an historian. They resolved
that such an historical system
as this was a nuisance to be abated,
and that the new and unworthy man-worship
should be put an end to. Accordingly
the idol was smashed;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and
in the process, the idol's historian left
so badly damaged as to render his
future availability highly problematical.</p>

<p>The Scotch treatment was of instant
efficacy; for we find Mr. Froude
coming to his work on the fifth volume
in chastened frame of mind
and an evidently corrected demeanor.
He narrates the reigns of Mary and
Edward VI. with style and tone subdued,
and in what musicians designate
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tempo moderato</i>.</p>

<p>With the seventh volume we reach
the accession of Queen Elizabeth.
We opened it with some curiosity; for
it was understood from Mr. Froude,
at the outset of his historical career,
that he intended to present Elizabeth
as "a great nature destined to remould
the world," and that he was prepared
to visit with something like astonishment
and unknown pangs all who
should dare question the immaculate
purity of her virtue. It is not improbable
that the contemplation of
the strewn and broken fragments of
the paternal idol materially modified
this purpose&mdash;a change on which Mr.
Froude must more than once have
fervently congratulated himself as he
gradually penetrated deeper into the
treasures of the State paper collections,
and stared with stiffened jaw at
the astounding revelations of Simancas.</p>

<p>We need not wonder that the historian
altered his programme; and
that instead of going on to the "death
of Elizabeth," to record the horrors
of that most horrible of death-bed
scenes, he should close his work with
the wreck of the Spanish Armada.</p>

<p>The researches of our American
historian, Motley, were terribly damaging
to Elizabeth; and in the preparation
of his seventh volume, Mr.
Froude comes upon discoveries so
fatal to her that he is evidently glad
to drop his showy narrative and fill
his pages with letters of the Spanish
ambassador, who gives simple but
wonderfully vivid pictures of scenes at
the English court.</p>

<p>Future historians will doubtless take
heed how they associate with the reputation
of the sovereign any glory
they may claim for England under
Elizabeth, remembering that she was
ready to marry Leicester notwithstanding
her strong suspicion, too
probably assurance, of his crime, (Amy
Robsart's murder,) and that in the language
of one of Mr. Froude's English
critics, "She was thus in the eye
of heaven, which judges by the intent
and not the act, nearer than Englishmen
would like to believe to the guilt
of an adulteress and a murderess."</p>

<p>But Mr. Froude plucks up courage,
and, true to his first love, while appearing
to handle Elizabeth with cruel
condemnation, treats her with real
kindness.</p>

<p>We have all heard of Alcibiades
and his dog, and of what befell that
animal. Mr. Froude assumes an air
of stern severity for those faults of
Elizabeth for which concealment is
out of the question&mdash;her mean parsimony,
her insincerity, her cruelty,
her matchless mendacity&mdash;while industriously
concealing or artistically
draping her more repulsive offences.</p>

<p>But we have not started out to
treat Mr. Froude's work as a whole.
A chorus of repudiation from the most
opposite schools of criticism has so
effectually covered his attempted apotheosis
of a bad man with ridicule and
contempt that no further remark need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
be made on that subject. As to Elizabeth,
the less said the better, if we
are friendly to her memory.</p>

<p>Careful perusal of Mr. Froude's
first six volumes will convince any
competent judge that he is not a
historian, but, as yet, only in training
to become one. He plunged into a
great historical subject without the requisite
knowledge or the necessary
preparation. In his earlier volumes
his very defective knowledge of all
history before the sixteenth century
led him into the most grotesque blunders&mdash;errors
in general and in details,
in geography, jurisprudence, titles,
offices, and military affairs. So
far from meriting the compliment paid
him, of accurate knowledge, acquired
in the "course of his devious theological
career," of the tenets and peculiar
observances of the leading religious
sects, it is precisely in such
matters that he seriously fails in accuracy.</p>

<p>With a half-grasp of his material,
Mr. Froude totally fails to make it
up into an interesting consecutive
narrative. He lacks, too, the all-important
power of generalization, and,
as has been aptly remarked, handles
a microscope skilfully, but is apparently
unable to see through a telescope.
Heroic and muscular, his over
haste to produce some startling result
came near wrecking him in the morning
of his career.</p>

<p>While his work was in course of
publication, our historian wrote from
Simancas a sensational article for <cite>Fraser's
Magazine</cite>, in which he announced
some astounding historical discoveries,
which only a few weeks later
he was only too glad to recall. The
trouble was that he had totally misunderstood
the Spanish documents on
which his discovery was grounded.</p>

<p>Along with his apparent incapacity
for sound and impartial judgment,
there is an evident inability in Mr.
Froude to distinguish the relative value
of different state papers, and the
most striking proof that he is still in
his apprenticeship as a writer of history,
is his indiscriminate acceptance
of written authorities of a certain
class. Historical results long since
settled by the unanimous testimony
of Camden, Carte, and Lingard, the
three great English historians of the
seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth
centuries respectively, are thrust
aside by Mr. Froude and made to
give way to some <span class="smcap lowercase">MS.</span> of doubtful value
or questionable authenticity. The
term "original document" magically
invests every writing falling into his
hands with all the attributes of truth.
When he finds a paper three hundred
years old, he gives it speech and sets
it up as an oracle. Nor can the simile
be arrested here; for, treating his
oracle with the tyrannic familiarity of
a heathen priest, the paper Mumbo
Jumbo must speak as ordered, or else
be sadly cuffed. It is a puerile idea
to imagine that when the historian
has found a mass of original historical
papers, his labor of investigation is
ended, and he has but to transcribe,
to put his personages on the stage,
let them act and declaim as these
writings relate, and thus place before
the reader the truthful portrait of
bygone times. Far from it. It is at
this point that his work really begins.
He must ascertain by comparison,
by sifting of evidence, by many precautions,
who lies and who speaks
truth. In matters of Elizabethan diplomacy,
for instance, the truth floats
not on the surface. A royal dispatch
gives orders, but it does not give motives.
And even if the motives are
stated, is it certain they are truly
stated? A minister is explicit as to
what he wishes done; but he does not
say why he wants it done, nor what results
he looks for. Cases numberless
will suggest themselves as to the difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of such documents. Very few of
these difficulties have any terrors for
Mr. Froude. Commencing his investigation
with his theory perfected, it
is with him a mere choice of papers.
Swift is the fate of facts not suiting his
theory. So much the worse for them, if
they are not what he would have them
to be; they are cast forth into outer
darkness.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude has fine perceptive and
imaginative faculties&mdash;admirable gifts
for literature, but not for history.
Precious, if history depended on fiction,
not on fact. Invaluable, if historic
truth were subjective. Above
all price, where the literary artist has
the privilege of evolving from the
inner depths of his own consciousness
the virtues or the vices wherewith it
suits him to endow his characters.
But alas! otherwise utterly fatal, because
historic truth is eminently objective.</p>

<p>It is well said that to be a good
historical student, a man should not
find it in him to desire that any historical
fact should be otherwise than
it is. Now, we cannot consent to a
lower standard in logic and morality
for the historian than for the student;
and thus testing Mr. Froude, it is not
pleasant to contemplate his sentence
when judged by stern votaries of
truth. For we have a well-grounded
belief that not only is it possible for
Mr. Froude to desire an historical
fact to be otherwise than it is, but
that he is capable of carrying that
desire into effect. It is idle to talk
of the judicial quality of an historian
who scarcely puts on a semblance of
impartiality.</p>

<p>In matters of state, Mr. Froude is
a pamphleteer; in personal questions
he is an advocate. He holds a brief
for Henry. He holds a brief against
Mary Stuart. He is the most effective
of advocates, for he fairly throws
himself into his case. He is the
friend or the enemy of all the personages
in his history. Their failure
and their success affect his spirits and
his style. He rejoices with them or
weeps with them. There are some
whose misfortunes uniformly make
him sad. There are others over
whose calamities he becomes radiant.
He has no unerring standard of justice,
no ethical principle which estimates
actions as they are in themselves,
and not in the light of sympathy
or repulsion.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, nevertheless,
that Mr. Froude makes up an attractive-looking
page. Foot-notes and
citations in quantity, imposing capitals
and inverted commas, like little
flags gayly flying, all combine to give
it a typographical vivacity truly charming.
Great as are his rhetorical resources,
he does not despise the cunning
devices of print. Quotation-marks
are usually supposed to convey
to the reader the conventional assurance
that they include the precise
words of the text. But Mr. Froude's
system is not so commonplace. He
inserts therein language of his own,
and in all these cases his use of authorities
is not only dangerous but
deceptive. He has a way of placing
some of the actual words of a document
in his narrative in such a manner
as totally to pervert their sense.
The historian who truthfully condenses
a page into a paragraph saves labor
for the reader; but Mr. Froude
has a trick of giving long passages in
quotation-marks without sign of alteration
or omission, which we may or
may not discover from a note to be
"abridged."</p>

<p>Other objectionable manipulations
of Mr. Froude are the joining together
of two distinct passages of a document,
and entirely changing their
original sense; the connection of two
phrases from two different authorities
and connecting them as one; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
tacking of irresponsible or anonymous
authorities to one that is responsible,
concealing the first, and avowing the
last.</p>

<p>Then his texts, and the rapid boldness
with which he disposes of them;
cutting, trimming, clipping, provided
only that he produce an animated dialogue
or picturesque effect which may
cause the reader to exclaim, "How
beautifully Mr. Froude writes!" "What
a painter!" "His book is as interesting
as a novel!" And so it is; for
the excellent reason that it is written
precisely as novels are written, and
mainly depends for its interest upon
the study of motives. A superior
novelist brings characters before us in
startling naturalness&mdash;his treatment,
of course, being subjective, not objective;
arbitrary, not historical. Mr.
Froude, with his great skill in depicting
individual character and particular
events, follows the novel-writer's
method, and may be said to be the
originator of what we may designate
as the "psychological school" of history.
This power gives him an immense
advantage over all other historians.</p>

<p>While they are burning the midnight
lamp in the endeavor to detect
the springs of action by the study of
every thing that can throw light upon
the action itself, he has only to look
through the window which, like unto
other novelists, he has constructed in
the bosom of every one of his characters,
to show us their most secret
thoughts and aspirations. One may
open any of Mr. Froude's volumes at
random and find an exemplification
of what is here stated. Here is one:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was not thus that Mary Stuart had
hoped to meet her brother. His head sent
home from the border, or himself brought
back a living prisoner, with the dungeon,
the scaffold, and the bloody axe&mdash;these were
the images which a few weeks or days before
she had associated with the next appearance
of her father's son. Her feelings
had undergone no change; she hated him
with the hate of hell; but the more deep-set
passion paled for the moment before a thirst
for revenge." (Vol. viii. p. 267.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Here are depicted the tumultuous
workings of a wicked heart; its hopes,
fears, passions&mdash;nay, even the very
images that float before the mind's
eye. And this Mr. Froude asks us to
accept for history&mdash;ascertained fact.</p>

<p>Our historian takes unprecedented
liberties with texts and citations.
Now he totally ignores what a given
person says on an important
occasion. Now he puts a speech of
his own into the mouth of the same
character. Passages cited from certain
documents cannot be found there,
and other documents referred to have
no existence. In a word, Mr. Froude
trifles with his readers and plays with
his authorities, as some people play
with cards.</p>

<p>There are not many passages of
Mr. Froude's work free from some
one of these serious objections. To
specify them would require at least as
much matter as he uses; for he offends
as often in suppression as in assertion.
Nevertheless, to the extent of our limited
space we will point out a few,
and as Mr. Froude's early volumes
have been so amply commented upon,
we will confine our examination to the
latter half of the work, with special
reference to his treatment of</p>


<h3>MARY STUART.</h3>

<p>Most historians begin at the beginning.
But our latest historical school
has resources heretofore unknown,
and quietly anticipates that ordinary
point of departure. Mary Stuart is
formally brought on to Mr. Froude's
historical stage in the middle of the
seventh volume, and the reader might
be supposed to take up her story
without a single preconceived opinion.
Doubtless, the average reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
does so take it up, unsuspicious of the
fact that his judgment is already fettered
and led captive. In volume
iv. p. 208, Mary of Guise is described
as lifting her baby out of the cradle,
in order that Sir Ralph Sadlier "might
admire its health and loveliness."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Alas! for the child," says Mr. Froude;
"born in sorrow and nurtured in treachery!
It grew to be Mary Stuart; and Sir Ralph
Sadlier lived to sit on the commission which
investigated the murder of Darnley."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is nothing very startling in
this. The reader's mind absorbs the
statement, and goes on. In the next
volume, (vol. v. p. 57,) while deeply
interested in the military operations
of the Duke of Somerset, we are told
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thursday he again advanced over the
ground where, fourteen years later, Mary
Stuart, the object of his enterprise, practiced
archery with Bothwell ten days after her
husband's murder."</p></blockquote>

<p>Consummately artistic!</p>

<p>The reader has not yet reached Mary
Stuart; her history is not yet commenced;
he supposes his mind, as regards
her, to be a mere blank page, and
yet our historian has already contrived
to inscribe upon the blank page two
facts, namely, she was the murderess of
Darnley, and she was guilty of adultery
with Bothwell. No evidence
has been offered, no argument presented.
With graceful and almost
careless <i>disinvoltura</i>, Mr. Froude has
merely alluded to two incidents, one
of which is a fable, and lo! the
case against Mary Stuart is complete.
For these are the two great
accusations upon which the entire
controversy hinges, a controversy
that has raged for three centuries.
Very clever! Very clever indeed!</p>

<p>Give but slight attention to Mr.
Froude's system and you will find
that his treatment of the historical characters
he dislikes is after the recipe
of Figaro: "Calomniez, calomniez,
il en reste toujours quelque chose;"
and that under the sentimentality of
his "summer seas," "pleasant mountain
breezes," "murmuring streams,"
"autumnal suns," patriotic longings,
and pious reveries, there is a vein
of persistent and industrious cunning
much resembling that of Mr. Harold
Skimpole, who is a perfect child in
all matters concerning money, who
knows nothing of its value, who "loves
to see the sunshine, loves to hear the
wind blow; loves to watch the changing
lights and shadows; loves to hear
the birds, those choristers in nature's
great cathedral"&mdash;but, meantime,
keeps a sharp look-out for the main
chance.</p>

<p>Indirection and insinuation are effective
weapons never out of Mr.
Froude's hands. In an allusion or
remark, dropped apparently in the
most careless manner, he will, as we
see, lay the foundation of a system
of attack one or two volumes off and
many years in historical advance of
his objective point. In like manner,
at page 272, vol. i., we are told "three
years later, when the stake recommenced
its hateful activity under the
auspices of Sir Thomas More's fanaticism."
Thus the way is prepared
for the accusation of personal cruelty,
which Mr. Froude strives, in vol. ii.,
to lay at More's door. More's greatness
and beautiful elevation of character
are evidently unpleasant subjects
for our historian, and he grudgingly
yields him a credit which he
seeks to sweep away in the charge of
religious persecution, specifying four
particular cases: those of Philipps,
Field, Bilney, and Bainham.</p>

<p>These cases have been taken up
<i>seriatim</i> by a competent critic, (the
reader curious to see them may consult
the appendix to the October
number <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> 1858,)
who demonstrates that Mr. Froude's
pretended authorities do <em>not</em> tell the
story he undertakes to put in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
mouth, and that he is guilty of such
perversions as are exceedingly damaging
to his reputation.</p>

<p>In introducing Mary Stuart, Mr.
Froude vouchsafes no information
whatever concerning her mind, manners,
disposition, or education. It is
certainly desirable to know something
of the early years and mental development
of a character destined to fill so
prominent a part in the great events
of the period, and to become one of
the most interesting personages in history.
She is thus presented: "She
was not yet nineteen years old; but
mind and body had matured amidst
the scenes in which she passed her
girlhood." (Vol. vii. p. 268.) This
is at once a very remarkable statement
and a mild specimen of Mr.
Froude's command of ambiguous language.
Very close and philosophical
observers have, we think, already noticed
the phenomenon indicated; and
although it might not at once occur
to every one that young girls usually
mature amidst the scenes of their girlhood,
yet it was hardly worth the effort
of a philosophic historian to give
us information so trite. But we suspect
Mr. Froude of a deeper meaning,
namely, that mind and body
were then&mdash;at eighteen years&mdash;matured,
and had attained their full growth.
It means that, or it is mere twaddle.</p>

<p>Thus, we are to understand that
Mary Stuart, at the tender age of
eighteen, was abnormal and monstrous.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude drives his entering
wedge so noiselessly that you are
scarce aware of it, and in the development
of the story he strains all his
faculties to paint the Queen of Scots,
not only as the worst and most abandoned
of women, but as absolutely
destitute of human semblance in her
superhuman wickedness. That such
is the effect of his portraiture, is well
expressed by an English critic&mdash;a
friend of Mr. Froude, but not of
Mary: "A being so earthly, sensual,
and devilish seems almost beyond the
proportions of human nature." (London
<cite>Times</cite>, September 26th, 1866.)</p>

<p>Mr. Froude then gives us a portrait
of the young Scottish queen, in
which he says, "In the deeper and
nobler emotions she had neither share
nor sympathy;" and herein, Mr.
Froude explains, "lay the difference
between the Queen of Scots and Elizabeth."
Again we must regret that
our author has told us nothing of
Mary Stuart's youth, so that we might
judge this matter for ourselves. Her
life in France was by no means devoid
of interest. She was admired and beloved
by all. She had reigned there
as queen, and young as she was, her
opinions were respected in high councils.</p>

<p>Throckmorton, a clever and experienced
diplomatist, was near Mary in
France, for many years, and, with the
fullest means of information, advised
Elizabeth day by day concerning her.
She is the subject of scores of his dispatches,
with none of which, however,
are we favored by Mr. Froude.
Throckmorton thus announces to Cecil
Mary's condition after the death
of King Francis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He departed to God, leaving as heavy
and dolorous a wife as of good right she had
reason to be, who, by long watching with
him during his sickness, and by painful diligence
about him, especially the issue thereof,
is not in the best time of her body, but
without danger."</p></blockquote>

<p>But Mr. Froude, who is ready to
reveal for our entertainment the inmost
thoughts of this "dolorous wife,"
enlightens us with the sole information
that "Mary was speculating before
the body was cold on her next choice."
Throckmorton, all unconscious of the
annoyance he must give a nineteenth
century historian, again writes to Cecil:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since her husband's death she hath
shown, and so continueth, that she is of
great wisdom for her years, modesty, and
also of great judgment in the wise handling
herself and her matters, which, increasing
in her with her years, cannot but turn to
her commendation, reputation, honor, and
great profit to her country."</p></blockquote>

<p>He continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I see her behavior to be such, and her
wisdom and queenly modesty so great, in
that she thinketh herself not too wise, but is
content to be ruled by good counsel and
wise men."</p></blockquote>

<p>As a general rule, Mr. Froude is not
economical of "birth, parentage, and
education" essays. Yet, while managing
to bestow them on very secondary
personages, he has none for Mary
Stuart. Latimer and John Knox are
favored in this respect, and even to the
bastard son of Henry VIII.&mdash;"the
young Marcellus," as Mr. Froude
proudly calls him&mdash;are devoted nearly
three full pages of gushing enthusiasm
concerning his youthful dispositions
and early studies. He was, alas!
"illegitimate, unfortunately;" "<em>but</em>
of beauty and noble promise." (Vol. i.
364-6.)</p>

<p>Soon we see the resources of the
psychological school. Mr. Froude
informs us (vol. vii. p. 369) that Mary
was going to Scotland "to use her
charms as a spell;" "to weave the
fibres of a conspiracy;" to "hide her
purpose until the moment came," and
"with a purpose as fixed as the stars
to trample down the reformation."</p>

<p>Had it been possible for Mr. Froude
to produce one word of testimony
from France concerning Mary Stuart's
youth that was not of respect, praise,
and admiration, from friend or foe, he
surely would not have failed to cite it.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, he quotes Randolph,
(vol. vii. p. 369,) to show "her
craft and deceit;" adding, "Such was
Mary Stuart when, on the 14th of
August, she embarked for Scotland."</p>

<p>But Randolph at that time had
never seen Mary Stuart, and the date
of his letter cited by Mr. Froude is
<i>October</i> 27th. Under these circumstances
it becomes interesting to know
what Randolph's opinion of Mary
really was before she left France.
Randolph writes to Cecil, <i>August</i> 9th,
referring to Mary's preparations for
departure, "That will be a stout adventure
for a sick, <em>crazed</em> woman."</p>

<p>Even for a sea voyage, Mr. Froude
continues to prefer a microscope to a
telescope. The consequence is, that
out of an escort of Mary's three uncles,
all her ladies, including the four Marys,
more than a hundred French noblemen,
the Mareschal d'Amville, BrantÃ´me
the historian, and other distinguished
men, a doctor of theology,
two physicians, and all her household
retinue, he can discern no one but
Chatelar, who was, as a retainer of
d'Amville, in that nobleman's suite.
And so we read, "With adieu, belle
France, sentimental verses, and a passionate
Chatelar sighing at her feet
in melodious music, she sailed away
over the summer seas." Which we
must in candor admit to be a sweetly
pretty passage. But in the next paragraph
Mr. Froude puts away sentimentality,
means business, and throws
a bright light on a previous line:
"Elizabeth could feel like a man an
unselfish interest in a great cause."
Here is the paragraph, it is admirable
in every respect.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The English fleet was on her track.
There was no command to arrest her; yet
there was the thought that 'she might be
met withal;' and if the admiral had sent
her ship with its freight to the bottom of the
North Sea, 'being done unknown,' Elizabeth,
and perhaps Catharine de' Medicis as
well, 'would have found it afterward well
done.'" (Vol. vii. p. 370.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, it would have been "well
done;" because "in the deeper and
nobler emotions Mary had neither
share nor sympathy;" whereas Elizabeth
and Catharine de' Medicis had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The undisputed record of Mary's
arrival in Edinburgh is, that her surpassing
beauty and charm of address,
arising not so much from her courtly
training as her kindly heart, created a
profound impression on a people who
already reverenced in her the daughter
of a popular king, and of one of the
noblest and best of women.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude thus renders this record:
"The dreaded harlot of Babylon
seemed only a graceful and innocent
girl." (Vol. vii. p. 374.) In common
fairness, Mr. Froude should have
given some adequate idea of the condition
of the country this inexperienced
young queen was called to rule.
This he fails to do. It was such that
the ablest sovereign, with full supply
of money and of soldiers&mdash;and Mary
Stuart had neither&mdash;would have found
its successful government almost impossible.
The power of the feudal
aristocracy had declined in Europe
everywhere but in Scotland; and
everywhere but in Scotland royal
power had been increased. For centuries
the Scottish kings had striven
to break down the power of the
nobles, which overshadowed that of
the crown. One of the results of this
struggle is quaintly recorded in the
opening entry of Birrel's <cite>Diurnal of
Occurrents</cite>:</p>

<p>"<i>There has been in this realm of
Scotland one hundred and five kings, of
whilk there was slaine fyftie-six.</i>"</p>

<p>Another result was greater aristocratic
power and increased anarchy.
The Scotch feudal nobles had never
known what it was to be under the
rule of law, and there was as yet no
middle class to aid the sovereign.
Among their recognized practices and
privileges were private war and armed
conspiracy; and the established
means of ridding themselves of personal
or public enemies was assassination.
In all history we find few
bands of worse men than those who
surrounded the throne of Mary Stuart.
Cruelty, treachery, and cunning were
their leading characteristics. Some
of them were Protestants in their
own peculiar way, and, as John Knox
says, referring to the disposition of
the church lands, "for their own commoditie."</p>

<p>Personally, they are thus described
by Burton, the latest historian of Scotland,
a bitter opponent of Mary Stuart:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Their dress was that of the camp or stable;
they were dirty in person, and abrupt
and disrespectful in manner, carrying on
their disputes, and even fighting out their
fierce quarrels, in the presence of royalty."</p></blockquote>

<p>In view of the picturesque statement
that Mary Stuart went to Scotland
with a "resolution as fixed as
the stars to trample down the Reformation,"
her first public acts are of
great interest. Mr. Froude states
them so imperfectly (vol. vii. p. 374)
that they make but slight impression.
The friends of her mother and the
Catholic nobles expected to be called
into her councils. Instead of them,
she selected the Lord James (her
half-brother) and Maitland as her
chief ministers, with a large majority
of Protestant lords in her council.
She threw herself upon the loyalty of
her people, and issued a proclamation
forbidding any attempt to interfere
with the Protestant religion which
she found established in her realm.
She did not plead, as Mr. Froude
states, that she might have her own
service in the royal chapel, but
claimed it as a right expressly guaranteed.
"The Lord Lindsay might
croak out texts that the idolater should
die the death." (Vol. vii. p. 375.)</p>

<p>That was a truly energetic "croak"!
Listen to it, (not in Froude.) When
service in the queen's chapel was
about to begin, Lindsay, clad in full
armor and brandishing his sword, rushed
forward shouting, "The idolater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
priest shall die the death!" The almoner
fortunately, for himself, heard
the "croak," took refuge, and after
the service was protected to his home
by two lords; "and then," says Knox,
"the godly departed with great grief
of heart."</p>

<p>The interview between Queen Mary
and John Knox is narrated by Mr.
Froude in such a manner as to tone
down the coarseness of Knox's conduct,
and lessen the brilliancy of the
dialectic victory of the young Scotch
girl over the old priest and minister.
She first inquired about his <i>Blast
against the Regiment of Women</i>, in
which he declares&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This monstriferous empire of women,
among all the enormities that do this day
abound upon the face of the whole earth, is
most detestable and damnable. Even men
subject to the counsel or empire of their
wives are unworthy of all public office."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Froude describes Knox as saying,
"Daniel and St. Paul." He ought
to know that a Scotch Puritan could
not have said <i>Saint</i> Paul. Macaulay
never makes such mistakes. "Daniel
and St. Paul were not of the religion
of Nebuchadnezzar and Nero." (Vol.
vii. p. 376.) Incorrect. Knox having
first modestly likened himself unto
Plato, thus states his own language:</p>

<p>"I shall be alse weall content to lyve
under your grace as Paull was to lyve
under Nero." It is hard to say which
is greater, the man's vanity in comparing
himself to St. Paul, or his intolerable
insolence in likening, to her
face, the young queen to the bloodiest
of all Roman tyrants. William
Cobbett, a writer of sturdy and unadulterated
English, in referring to
some such performance as this on the
part of Knox, calls him "the Ruffian
of the Reformation." We strongly
suspect, though, that Knox did not
use language so gratuitously offensive.
His account of the interview was written
years afterward. He was self-complacent
and boastful, and in other
places says that he caused the queen
to weep so bitterly that a page could
scarce get her enough handkerchiefs
to dry her eyes. Before Mary, Knox
claimed that Daniel and his fellows,
although subjects to Nebuchadnezzar
and to Darius, would not yet be of
the religion of the one nor the other.
Mary was ready with her answer, and
retorted, "Yea; but none of these men
raised the sword against their princes."
Mr. Froude, of course, reports this reply
in such a manner as to spoil it;
adding, "But Knox answered merely
that 'God had not given them the
power.'" Not so; for Knox strove
by logical play, which he himself records,
to show that resistance and
non-compliance were one and the
same thing. "Throughout the whole
dialogue," says Burton, "he does not
yield the faintest shred of liberty of
conscience." But Mary kept him to
his text, repeating, "But yet they
resisted not with the sword." And
then, this young woman, who, Mr.
Froude assures us, came to Scotland
with "spells to weave conspiracies,"
"to control herself and to hide her
purpose," blunderingly tells Knox that
she believed "the Church of Rome
was the true church of God."</p>

<p>One would think it no very difficult
task for a man of age and experience
to see through an impulsive
girl of nineteen, whose face mirrored
her soul. And yet, Mr. Froude informs
us triumphantly, <ins title="Note: Original reads 'three several'">three separate</ins>
times, that "Knox had looked Mary
through and through." In this connection
we have one of our historian's
best efforts, to which we ask special
attention.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Knox had labored to save Murray from
the spell which his sister had flung over
him; but Murray had only been angry at
his interference, and, 'they spake not familiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
for more than a year and a half.'"
(Vol. vii. p. 542.)<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Pray notice the cause of this estrangement.
Mr. Froude is very explicit
here. Look at it. This innocent
Murray is under a spell. All
heart himself, he saw no guile in his
sister. But Knox warned him against
the sorceress, <i>and that was the cause
of the coolness between them</i>. On this
point there can be no mistake, and
we now propose to place John Knox
on the stand and with his eyes to look
Mr. Froude "through and through."
In the parliament of 1563, Murray
had the "Act of Oblivion" passed, in
which he managed to reserve for himself
and his friends the power to say
who should or should not profit by
its provisions. With this act he was
dangerous to all who opposed him,
and was consequently all-powerful.
Under these circumstances, John Knox
pressed Murray, now that he had the
power, to establish the religion, namely,
pass in a constitutional manner
the informal act of 1560, and legalize
the confession of faith as the doctrine
of the Church of Scotland.</p>

<p>Now call the witness, John Knox:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But the erledom of Murray needed confirmation,
and many things were to be ratified
that concerned the help of friends and
servants&mdash;and the matter fell so hote betwix
the Erle of Murray and John Knox, that familiarlie
after that time they spack nott together
more than a year and a half."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, if we may believe Knox himself,
it was Murray's preference for his
own "singular commoditie" over the
interests of the kirk of God which
caused that "they spake not familiarly
together for more than a year and
a half." Of "spell" and "enchantress"
no word. We refrain from comment.</p>

<p>One remark as to the "spell" Mary
had flung over Murray. Even
from Mr. Froude's pages may be
wrung the unwilling admission that
"the stainless Murray" was neither
more nor less than the paid and pensioned
spy of Elizabeth. Here is another
dispatch of Throckmorton, (Elizabeth's
ambassador at Paris,) <em>not</em> referred
to by Mr. Froude:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Lord James came to my lodgings
<i>secretly unto me</i>, and declared unto me at
good length all that had passed between the
queen, his sister, and him, and between the
Cardinal Lorraine and him, the circumstances
whereof he will declare to your majesty
particularly when he cometh to your presence."</p></blockquote>

<p>This business call of Lord James
was made during Mary's preparations
to leave France for Scotland. He
followed it up with a confidential visit
of some days to Elizabeth, who allowed
him not to depart empty-handed.
Unsuspicious of his treachery,
Mary heaped honors and riches upon
him, made him her first lord of council,
and created him successively Earl
of Mar and Earl of Murray. And
we are asked by Mr. Froude to believe
that over such a personage as
this "spells" might be successfully
flung by the victim of his treachery.</p>


<h3>THE MURDER OF RICCIO.</h3>

<p>The introduction of Riccio by Mr.
Froude (vol. viii. p. 120) is a good
specimen of his best art. There is
an accusation in every line, an insinuation
in every word; yet when he is
through, the reader is left in total ignorance
of the Italian's real position.
Mr. Froude calls him Ritzio, which
is a piece of affectation. The name
has heretofore been written Rizzio and
Riccio. Ritzio, to the English eye,
it is true, very nearly represents the
Italian pronunciation of Rizzio. The
man's name was Riccio, as is well
determined by one letter of his, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
two of his brother Joseph, all still in
existence and perfectly accessible to
Mr. Froude.</p>

<p>His age, variously stated from thirty
to forty, is never put at less than
thirty. Mr. Froude gives no figure,
and calls him "the youth;" by which
you may, if you choose, understand
eighteen or twenty. His real employment
is concealed, and at p. 247,
vol. viii., he is called "a wandering
musician." Riccio was a man of solid
acquirements, able and accomplished.
He succeeded to the post formerly
held by Raulet&mdash;that of secretary
for the queen's French correspondence&mdash;and
was thoroughly versed
in the languages as well as in the
troubled politics of the day. He was,
moreover, devotedly loyal, and inspired
Mary with entire confidence
in his integrity. Sir Walter Scott
(<cite>History of Scotland</cite>) says that a person
like him, "skilled in languages
and in business," was essential to the
queen, and adds, "No such agent
was likely to be found in Scotland,
unless she had chosen a Catholic
priest, which would have given more
offence to her Protestant subjects," etc.</p>

<p>"The queen," says Knox, "usit
him for secretary in things that appertainit
to her secret affairs in France
and elsewhere."</p>

<p>"That he was old, deformed, and
strikingly ugly, has been generally accepted
by historians," says Burton.</p>

<p>Having, it appears, no access to
these three Scotch historians, Mr.
Froude is thrown on his own resources
and evolves, "He became a favorite
of Mary&mdash;he was an accomplished
musician; he soothed her
hours of solitude with love-songs,"
etc., etc.</p>

<p>In his statement of the circumstances
of the plot for the murder, Mr.
Froude dwells complacently on every
injurious insinuation against Mary
Stuart. Referring to a calumnious
invention, falsely attributed to Darnley,
(vol. viii. p. 248,) he is of opinion
that "Darnley's word was not a
good one; he was capable of inventing
such a story;" that "Mary's treatment
of him went, it is likely, no further
than coldness or contempt;" but
nevertheless he strives to convey the
worst impression against her. If Mr.
Froude has a "vivid pen," he also
has a light one. He glides delicately
over the character of the conspiracy
to kill Riccio, and manages to veil
the real motives. Riccio was assassinated
on the ninth of March. Nearly
a month previous, on the thirteenth
of February, Randolph writes to Leicester,
for Elizabeth's eye, (the letter
need not be sought for in Froude,)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I know that there are practices in hand,
contrived between father and son, (Lennox
and Darnley,) to come to the crown against
her (Mary Stuart's) will. I know that if
that take effect which is intended, David,
(Riccio,) with the consent of the king, shall
have his throat cut within these ten days.
Many things grievouser and worse than
these are brought to my ears; <i>yea, of things
intended against her own person</i>, which, because
I think better to keep secret than to
write to Mr. Secretary, I speak of them but
now to your lordship."</p></blockquote>

<p>And yet all this was but a part of
the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Randolph is an authority against
whom objection from Mr. Froude is
impossible. Nevertheless, he ignores
this letter and many others fully confirming
it, (vol. viii. p. 254,) thrusts
out of sight the real motives, which
were political, and industriously works
up notorious inventions aimed at Mary
Stuart's character.</p>

<p>Looking at it as a mere work of
art, and without reference to the facts,
the murder scene is admirably described
by Mr. Froude. (Vol. viii. p. 257,
<i>et seq.</i>) One serious drawback is his
insatiable desire for embellishment.
For the mere purpose of description
none is needed. The subject is full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to overflowing of the finest dramatic
material. The result of Mr. Froude's
narration is very remarkable. He
skilfully manages to centre the reader's
sympathy and admiration on the
assassin Ruthven, and, with device of
phrase and glamour of type, places
the sufferer and victim of an infamous
brutality in the light of a woman who
is merely undergoing some well-merited
chastisement. The whole scene
as pictured rests on the testimony of
the leading assassin, (Ruthven,) from
a London <i>editio expurgata</i>; for Chalmers
shows (vol. ii. p. 352) that the account
given by Ruthven and Morton,
dated April 30th, is the revised and
corrected copy of what they sent to
Cecil on the 2d of April, asking him
to make such changes as he saw fit
before circulating it in Scotland and
England. Their note of April 2d still
exists; but Mr. Froude does not allude
to it. Thus we have the story
from the chief murderer, corrected by
Cecil and embellished by Mr. Froude,
who, while admitting that "the recollection
of a person who had just been
concerned in so tremendous a scene
was not likely to be very exact," (vol.
viii. p. 261,) nevertheless adopts the
version of that person in preference
to all others. Why not exercise the
most rudimentary prudence and plainest
judgment by controlling Ruthven's
recital by that of another?&mdash;for there
are several. And if, after all, we
must perforce have Ruthven's, why
not give it as it is, sparing us such
inventions as "turning on Darnley as
on a snake," and "could she have
trampled him into dust upon the spot,
she would have done it." Mr. Froude
is all himself here. "Catching sight of
the empty scabbard at his side, she
asked him where his dagger was. He
said he did not know. '<i>It will be
known hereafter; it shall be dear blood
to some of you if David's be spilt.</i>'" This
is a specimen of able workmanship.
According to Keith, Mary's answer
was, "It will be known hereafter."
According to Ellis, Mary had <em>previously</em>
said to Ruthven, "It shall be
dear blood to some of you if David's
be spilt." Now, let the reader observe
that Mr. Froude takes these
two phrases, found in two different
authors, addressed separately to two
different persons, reverses the order
in which they are spoken, and puts
them into one sentence, which he
makes Mary address to Darnley! Do
you see why so much industry and
ingenuity should be exerted? <i>Because
in this form the phrase is a threat of murder</i>;
and thus the foundation is laid
broad and deep in the reader's mind
for the belief that from that moment
Mary has a design upon Darnley's
life.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>One thing Mr. Froude does state
correctly. We mean Mary's words
when told that Riccio was dead. In
her fright, anguish, and horror she
ejaculated, "Poor David! good and
faithful servant! May God have mercy
on your soul!" To those who
know the human heart, this involuntary
description of the precise place
poor David occupied in Mary's esteem
is more than answer to Mr.
Froude's indecent note at page 261,
and his malevolent insinuations on
all his pages. Mary struggled to the
window to speak to armed citizens
who had flocked to her assistance.
"Sit down!" cried one of the ruffian
lords to her. "If you stir, you shall
be cut into collops, and flung over
the walls." A prisoner in the hands
of these brutal assassins, after the unspeakable
outrages to which she had
been subjected, Mr. Froude yet has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>the admirable art of placing her before
his readers in the light of a wicked
woman deprived of her liberty for
her own good. When night came,
Ruthven called Darnley away, and
the queen was left to her rest in the
scene of the late tragedy; and, adds
Mr. Froude with beautiful equanimity,
"The ladies of her court were forbidden
to enter, and Mary Stuart was
locked alone into her room, amidst the
traces of the fray, to seek such repose
as she could find." This is true, and
in that blood-stained place she passed
the night alone.</p>

<p>"They had caged their bird,"
goes festively on our historian; but
they "knew little of the temper which
they had undertaken to control."
("Undertaken to control" is here positively
delicious!) "Behind that grace
of form there lay a nature like a panther's,
merciless and beautiful." (Vol.
viii. 265.) We have seen a panther's
skin admired, but we never before
heard that the animal had a beautiful
nature. Such are the reflections
suggested to Mr. Froude's sympathetic
mind by the horrible scenes he
has just described.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> One instinctively
trembles for those lambs, the lords,
with such a "panther" near them. All
this time Mr. Froude takes no further
notice of Mary's physical condition
than to treat the necessary results,
which, almost miraculously, were not
fatal, as "trick and policy." (Vol. viii.
266.) The queen was then in the
sixth month of her pregnancy, and the
possible consequences of the horrible
tragedy thus thrust suddenly before her
eyes were not unforeseen. The conspirators
in their bonds had <i>expressly
provided for the contingency of her death</i>.
When Mary escapes from the band of
assassins, Mr. Froude would have been
utterly inconsolable but for the fact
that her midnight ride gives him (vol.
viii. p. 270) the opportunity of executing
(<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempo agitato</i>) a spirited fantasia
on his historic lyre in his description
of the gallop of the fleeing cavalcade.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
It sounds like a faint echo
of BÃ¼rger's <i>Lenore</i>. Then he gives
credit without stint to Mary's iron fortitude
and intellectual address. He
is entirely too liberal in this regard.
Instead of riding "away, away, past
Seton," she stopped there for refreshments
and the escort of two hundred
armed cavaliers under Lord Seton,
who was advised of her coming.
Then, too, the letter she "<i>wrote with
her own hand</i>, fierce, dauntless, and
haughty," to Elizabeth, and which Mr.
Froude so minutely describes&mdash;"The
strokes thick, and slightly uneven from
excitement, but strong, firm, and without
sign of trembling!" This insanity
for the picturesque and romantic
would wreck a far better historian.
The prosaic fact is, that although, as
Mr. Froude states, the letter may be
seen in the Rolls House, <i>Mary Stuart
did not write it</i>. It was written by
an amanuensis, the salutation and signature
alone being in her hand. This
question was the subject of some controversy,
during the past year, in Paris
and London, and Mr. Wiesener, a
distinguished French historical writer,
requested Messrs. Joseph Stevenson
and A. Crosby, of the Record Office,
to examine the letter and give their
opinion. Their reply was, "The body
of the document is most certainly not
in Mary's handwriting." But, after
all, there was no occasion for controversy,
and still less for Mr. Froude's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>blunder. If he had ever read the
letter, he would have seen that Mary
wrote, "Nous pensions vous Ã©crire
cette lettre de notre propre main afin
de vous faire mieux comprendre, etc.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais de fait nous sommes si fatiguÃ©e et</i>
si mal Ã  l'aise, tant pour avoir couru
vingt milles en cinq heures de nuit
etc., que <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nous ne sommes pas en Ã©tat
de le faire</i> comme nous l'aurions souhaitÃ©."
It was her intention to have
written this letter with her own hand,
but on account of fatigue and illness
could not as she would have desired.
"Twenty miles in two hours,"
says Mr. Froude. Twenty miles in five
hours, modestly writes Mary Stuart.
Fortunately, we have been warned
by Mr. Froude against testimony from
that "suspected source!"</p>

<p>We close, for the present, with one
specimen (not by any means the worst)
of Mr. Froude's historical handicraft,
which exemplifies his peculiar system
of citation. He professes to give the
substance of a letter of Mary Stuart
published in Labanoff. (Vol. vii. p.
300.) Here is the letter, side by side
with Mr. Froude's version of it. We
select this out of numerous cases, for
the reason that Labanoff is here more
readily accessible than other authorities
treated in like manner by Mr.
Froude.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>of the contents of a letter of April 4th, 1566,
from Mary Stuart to Queen Elizabeth</i>.
(See vol. viii. p. 282.)</p>

<p>"In an autograph letter of passionate gratitude,
Mary Stuart placed herself, as it were,
under her sister's protection; she told her
that, in tracing the history of the late conspiracy,
she had found that the lords had intended
to imprison her for life; and if England
or France came to her assistance, they
had meant to kill her. She implored Elizabeth
<i>to shut her ears to the calumnies which
they would spread against her, and with engaging
frankness she begged that the past might
be forgotten</i>; she had experienced too deeply
the ingratitude of those by whom she was
surrounded <i>to allow herself to be tempted any
more into dangerous enterprises</i>; for her own
part, she was <i>resolved never to give offence to
her good sister again; nothing should be wanting</i>
to restore the happy relations which had
once existed between them; and should she
recover safely from her confinement, she
hoped that in the summer Elizabeth would
make a progress to the north, and that at
last she might have an opportunity of thanking
her in person for her kindness and <i>forbearance</i>.</p>

<p>"This letter was sent by the hands of a certain
Thornton, a confidential agent of Mary
Stuart, who had been employed on messages
to Rome. 'A very evil and naughty person,
whom I pray you not to believe,' was
Bedford's credential for him in a letter of
the 1st of April to Cecil. He was on his
way to Rome again on this present occasion.</p>

<p>"The public in Scotland supposed that he
was sent to consult the pope on the possibility
of divorcing Darnley, and it is remarkable
that the Queen of Scots at the close of
her own letter desired Elizabeth to give credit
to him on some <i>secret</i> matter which he
would communicate to her. She perhaps
hoped that Elizabeth would now assist her
in the dissolution of a marriage which she
had been so anxious to prevent."</p>

</p>

<p>[The opening paragraph of formal compliment
acknowledges reception of Elizabeth's
"favorable dispatch" by Melville.]</p>

<p>"When Melville arrived, he found me
but lately escaped from the hands of the
greatest traitors on earth, in the manner in
which the bearer will communicate, with a
true account of their most secret plot, which
was, that even in case the escaped lords and
other nobles, aided by you or by any other
prince, undertook to rescue me, they would
cut me in pieces and throw me over the
wall. Judge for yourself the cruel undertakings
of subjects against her who can sincerely
boast that she never did them harm.
Since then, however, our good subjects have
counselled with us, ready to offer their lives
in support of justice; and we have, therefore,
returned to this city to chastise some of its
people guilty of this great crime.</p>

<p>"Meantime, we remain in this castle, as
our messenger will more fully give you to
understand.</p>

<p>"<i>Above all other things</i>, I would especially
pray you carefully to see that your agents
on the Border comply with your good intentions
toward me, and, abiding by our treaty
of peace, expel those who have sought my
life from their territory, where the leaders
in this noted act are as well received as if
your intention were the worst possible, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la
pire du monde</i>,) and the very reverse of
what I know it to be.</p>

<p>"I have also heard that the Count (Earl)
of Morton is with you. I beg of you to arrest
and send him to me, or at least compel
him to return to Scotland, by depriving him
of safeguard in England. Doubtless he will
not fail to make false statements to excuse
himself; statements which you will find neither
true nor probable. I ask of you, my
good sister, to oblige me in all these matters,
with the assurance that I have experienced
so much ingratitude from my own people
that <em>I</em> shall never offend by a similar fault.
And to fully affirm our original friendship, I
would ask of you in any event (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quoique Dieu
m'envoie</i>) to add the favor of standing as
godmother for my child. I moreover hope
that, if I should recover by the month of
July, and you should make your progress as
near to my territory as I am informed you
will, to go, if agreeable, and thank you myself,
which above all things I desire to do.
(Then follow apologies for bad writing, for
which, she says, her condition must excuse
her, the usual compliments in closing a letter,
and wishes for Elizabeth's health and
prosperity.)</p>

<p>"Postscript. I beseech your kindness in a
matter I have charged the bearer to ask you
for me; and furthermore, I will soon write
you specially, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et au reste je vous depÃ©cherai
bientÃ´t exprÃ¨s</i>,) to thank you and to know
your intention, if it pleases you, to send me
some other minister, whom I may receive as
resident, who would be more desirous of
promoting our friendship than Randal<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> has
been found to be."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We leave the reader to form his
own estimate of this method of writing
history. Instead of a letter of
"passionate gratitude," written spontaneously,
as insinuated, it turns out
to be the answer to a dispatch (whether
written or verbal, it matters not)
transmitted by Elizabeth through Melville.
Mary's attitude and language
are dignified and independent, and
the missive, so far from having any
prayer for forbearance in its tone, is
plainly one of complaint and warning
to Elizabeth, couched, it is true, in
terms of politeness. The main subject,
"above all other things," is the
hospitable reception accorded to Riccio's
murderers in England, and Elizabeth
is delicately but emphatically
reminded of her duty and of the violation
of it by her border agents. The
passages of Mr. Froude's version marked
in italics <i>have no existence</i> in Mary's
letter, and are of his own invention.
Mary Stuart says that she has experienced
so much ingratitude from
her own (people) that <em>she</em> would never
offend any one by similarly sinning.
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'ai tant eprouvÃ© l'ingratitude des
miens que je n'offenserai jamais de
semblable pÃ©chÃ©.</i>) Mr. Froude makes
of this that she had experienced too
deeply the ingratitude, etc., "to <i>allow
herself to be tempted anymore into dangerous
enterprises</i>."</p>

<p>What dangerous enterprises? The
murder of Riccio? Was she guilty
of that too? Was it her midnight
escape? Mr. Froude alone has the
secret! And then the postscript? Randolph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>had not only offended, but deeply
injured her, and she wishes Elizabeth
to understand that he must not
be sent back to Scotland.</p>

<p>It is found "remarkable" that Mary,
in her postscript, desires Elizabeth
to receive communication of some verbal
matter (<i>not secret</i>, as Mr. Froude
states) from the messenger. But the
same request occurs twice in the body
of the letter. Mr. Froude is, of course,
accurately informed as to the hidden
meaning of the postscript, and settles
the matter with what "public opinion
supposed," and his usual "perhaps."</p>

<p>This is also an invention of Mr.
Froude. He supposes the supposition!
Then, too, his "evil and naughty
person" is uncalled for; for we know
that it was Bedford's business, as it
is Mr. Froude's calling, to judge any
messenger of Mary Stuart to be "evil
and naughty." In all this, the intelligent
reader will see that, as at page
261, vol. viii., Mr. Froude lays the
foundation of a plan of revenge by
Mary against Darnley, so he here
strives to fasten upon her the resolution
of obtaining a divorce, all going to
make cumulative evidence to be used
when we come to the Darnley murder.
"Deep, sir, deep!"</p>

<p>But there is a more serious aspect
to this matter. For three centuries
this Mary Stuart question has been a
vexed one among historians, and the
never-ending theme of acrimonious
controversy. What prospect is there
of reaching any solution if the subject
continues to be treated as we find it
in the work before us?</p>

<p>So far from settling any question in
dispute, or even solving any of the numerous
secondary problems underlying
the main issue, Mr. Froude, by
his violent partisanship, tortured citation,
paltering with the sense while
tampering with the text of authorities,
attribution of false motives and a
scandalous wealth of abusive epithets,
greatly grieves the most judicious of
those who condemn Mary Stuart, inspires
with renewed confidence those
who believe that she was a woman
more sinned against than sinning, and
begets the conviction that the cause
must be bad indeed which needs such
handling.</p>

"HARDING THE MONEY-SPINNER," ETC.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>"Let us show her the marble likeness,"
suggested Paulus, in an eager
whisper, with the air of a child devising
mischief.</p>

<p>While they were discussing this topic,
a gentle knock was heard at the
door, and then a very pretty girl of
about fifteen, with an open, sweet
countenance, and a remarkably modest,
cheerful bearing, presented herself,
carrying a sort of tray with various
articles for supper arranged thereon.</p>

<p>"May I come in? I am Benigna,"
said the girl, courtesying.</p>

<p>"Come in, Benigna," said the Greek
lady.</p>

<p>"Come in," added Agatha, in Latin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
but by no means with so good an
accent as her mother's. "You seem
like your name; you seem to be Benigna."</p>

<p>The girl looked at the beautiful
child with a sweet, grateful smile, and
immediately proceeded to prepare a
table and three covers for supper.</p>

<p>"Do you know Greek?"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> asked
Aglais.</p>

<p>"No, lady," replied the daughter
of the house. "My father is quite a
scholar; he was one of the secretary
slaves in the great house before he
got his freedom, and my mother has
learnt much from him; but I have
been brought up to help mother in
the inn, and never had time to learn
high things."</p>

<p>Agatha clapped her hands, and exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Then I'll talk my bad Latin to
Benigna, and she shall make it good."</p>

<p>The girl paused in her operations
at the table, and said,</p>

<p>"I thought Latin came naturally
to one, like the rain, and that it was
Greek which had to be worked out,
and made, just as wine is."</p>

<p>The landlady, carrying various articles,
entered as her daughter uttered
this valuable observation, and she
joined heartily in the laugh with
which it was greeted. Benigna gazed
round for a moment in amazement,
and then resumed her work, laughing
through sympathy, but very red from
the forehead to the dimples round her
pretty mouth.</p>

<p>The supper-table was soon ready.</p>

<p>Paulus, at whom the hostess had
frequently looked wistfully, now remarked
that they all felt much gratitude
for the kindness they were receiving,
and never could forget it.
Crispina, who was going out at the
moment, did not reply, but lingered
with her hand upon the door; the
other hand she passed once across her
eyes.</p>

<p>Then the Greek lady observed,</p>

<p>"Good hostess, these are the apartments
you intended for some barbarian
queen, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lady; for Queen Berenice,
daughter-in-law of King Herod
the IdumÃ¦an, called Herod the Great,
with her son Herod Agrippa, a wild
youth, I understand, about eighteen
years old, and her daughter Herodias."</p>

<p>"I heard the tribune quÃ¦stor, who
commands the prÃ¦torians, plead for
us with your husband," continued
Aglais; "and I suppose that the
quÃ¦stor's generous eloquence is the
cause of our being received into your
house at all. But this does not account
for your extraordinary kindness
to us. We expected to be barely tolerated
as inconvenient and unwelcome
guests, who kept better customers
away."</p>

<p>"Inconvenient and unwelcome!"
said Crispina, who seemed ready to
cry, as, looking around the little group,
her glance rested again upon Paulus.</p>

<p>"Whereas," resumed Aglais, "you
treat my dear children as if you were
their mother. Why are we so fortunate
as to find these feelings in a
stranger?"</p>

<p>The hostess paused a moment.
"Honored lady," said she, "the reason
is, that I once was the nurse of
a youth whom I loved as if he were
my own child; and it seemed to me
as if I saw my brave, beautiful, affectionate
nursling again when I saw
your son; but so long a time had
passed, I nearly fell with fright and
astonishment."</p>

<p>Agatha went to the bust of Tiberius,
lifted it, and, pointing to the marble
image, said in a low, tender voice,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"You nursed him?"</p>

<p>A little cry of dismay escaped the
lips of our hostess.</p>

<p>"No one ever thought of looking
beneath," said she. "My daughter
and I arrange and dust the room. I
must remove my poor boy's image.
He is indeed forgotten by most people
now; but it might harm us, and
alas! alas! could not help him, if this
silent face, that never smiles at me,
never talks to me any more, were to
be discovered. Do not speak of this
to any body, I beg of you, good lady,
and my pretty one. You will not?"
added she, smiling, but with tears in
her eyes as she looked at Paulus. "I
feel as though I had reared you."</p>

<p>They said they would take care
not to allude to the subject at all, except
among themselves, and then Aglais
remarked,</p>

<p>"You speak in sorrow of the youth
whom you nursed. Is he then
dead?"</p>

<p>"<i>Eheu!</i> lady, he is dead nearly
twenty years; but he was just about
your son's age when they put him to
death."</p>

<p>"Put him to death? Why was he
put to death, and by whom?" asked
Aglais.</p>

<p>"Hush! MÃ¦cenas and the emperor
ordered it to be done. Oh! do
take care. The whole world swarms
with spies, and you may be sure an
inn is not free from them. Things
have been more quiet of late years.
When I was young, I felt as if my
head was but glued to my shoulders,
and would fall off every day. As for
Crispus, did I not make him cautious
how he spake?"</p>

<p>"But your foster-son?"</p>

<p>"Ah poor boy! Poor young
knight! He was mad about the ancient
Roman liberties; a great student,
always reading Tully."</p>

<p>"Was that his crime?" demanded
Aglais.</p>

<p>The hostess wiped her eyes with
the sleeve of her <i>stola manicata</i>, and
said, in a tone little above a whisper,
looking round timidly, and closing the
door fast,</p>

<p>"Why, Augustus came suddenly
one day into a <i>triclinium</i>, where he
caught a nephew of his trying to hide
under a cushion some book which he
had been reading. Augustus took
the book, and found that it was one
of Tully's. The nephew thought he
was lost, remembering that it was Augustus
who had given up Cicero to
Mark Antony to be murdered. There
the emperor stood, fastened to the
page, and continued reading and reading
till at last he heaved a great breath,
and, rolling up the book on its roller,
laid it softly down, and said, '<i>A great
mind, a very great mind, my nephew</i>;'
and so he left the room."</p>

<p>"Then it was not your foster-son's
admiration of Cicero that caused his
death?"</p>

<p>"My foster-son was not Augustus's
nephew, you see; but <i>eheu!</i> how different
a case!&mdash;the nephew of a former
rival of Augustus. Nor used the
emperor's nephew to talk as my poor
child would talk. My foster-son used
to say that for Augustus to have given
up Tully, his friend and benefactor,
to be murdered by Mark Antony, in
order that he, Augustus, might be
allowed to murder somebody else, and
then to discover that neither he nor
the human race could enjoy justice,
nor see peace, nor have safety, till
this very same Antony should be
himself destroyed, was not a pretty
tale. Cicero had sided against, and
had resisted Julius CÃ¦sar; yet Julius
had given back his life to a man of
whom Rome and the civilized world
were proud. The same Tully had
sided <em>with</em>, not against, Augustus,
and had been the making of him; yet
the life which a noble enemy had
spared and left shining like a star, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
base friend stole, and suffered to be
quenched; and this for the sake of a
monster who, for the sake of mankind,
had to be very soon himself
destroyed. This was not a nice tale,
my poor Paulus used to say."</p>

<p>"Nor was it; but your Paulus?"
cried Aglais. The travellers all held
their breath in surprise and suspense.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What! the youth whom that bust
represents, and whom Augustus put
to death, was called Paulus?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They said he had engaged in
some conspiracy, the foolish dear!
But now, lady, I have been led, bit by
bit, into many disclosures, and I beseech
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fear not," interrupted Aglais; "I
cannot but cherish a fellow-feeling
with you; for, although I have something
to ask of the emperor, it is justice
only. I, too, look back to experiences
which are akin to yours. My
son yonder, whom the marble image
of your foster-son so strikingly resembles,
bears the same name, Paulus;
and the name of his father was that
which headed the first list of those
who, the Triumvirate agreed, should
die."</p>

<p>"Permit me, now, to ask once
more who you are, lady?" said Crispina.
"I know well the names upon
that list."</p>

<p>"My husband," replied the Greek
widow, "was brother of the triumvir
Lepidus."</p>

<p>"The triumvir was our master,"
answered the landlady; "and alas! it
is too true that he, the triumvir, was
timid and weak, and his son, about
whose image you have asked me, knew
not, poor youth, when he so bitterly
blamed Augustus for sacrificing Tully
to Mark Antony, that his own father
had given up a brother&mdash;that brother
whom you married&mdash;in the same terrible
days, and just in the same kind
of way."</p>

<p>"Whose bust, then, do you say is
this which is so like my son?" asked
Aglais.</p>

<p>"The bust of your son's first cousin,
lady. My foster-son's father was
your husband's brother."</p>

<p>"No wonder," cried Agatha, "that
my brother should be like his own
first cousin!"</p>

<p>"No," said Aglais; "but it is as surprising
as it is fortunate that we should
have come to this house, and have
fallen among kind persons disposed
to be friends, like our hostess, her
good husband, and little Benigna yonder."</p>

<p>"There is nothing which my husband
and I would not do," said Crispina,
"for the welfare of all belonging
to the great Ãmilian family, in
whose service we both were born and
spent our childhood; the family which
gave us our freedom in youth, and
our launch in life as a married couple.
As for me, you know now how I must
feel when I look upon the face of your
son."</p>

<p>A pause ensued, and then Aglais
said,</p>

<p>"Your former master, the triumvir,
wrote to my husband asking forgiveness
for having consented to let his
name appear in the list of the proscribed,
and explaining how he got it erased.
Therefore, let not that subject
trouble you."</p>

<p>"I happen, on my side, to know
for a fact," answered the hostess,
"that the one circumstance to which
you refer has been the great remorse
of the triumvir's life. The old man
still mumbles and maunders, complaining
that he never received a reply
to that letter. He would die happy
if he could but see you, and learn
that all had been forgiven."</p>

<p>Before Aglais had time to make
any answer, the landlord appeared,
carrying a small <i>cadus</i>, or cask, marked
in large black letters&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
L. CARNIFICIO<br />
S. POMPEIO<br />
COS.<br />
</p>

<p>Benigna had previously set upon a
separate <i>mensa</i>, or table, according
to custom, fruits, and fictile or earthen
cups.</p>

<p>"I thought so!" cried good Crispus.
"Women (excuse me, lady, I mean
my wife and daughter) will jabber
and cackle even when ladies may be
tired, and, as I sincerely hope, hungry.
Do, Crispina, let me see the
ladies and this young knight enjoy
their little supper. This Alban wine,
my lady, is nearly fifty years old, I do
assure you; look at the consul's name
on the cask. Benigna, young as she
is, might drink ten <i>cyathi</i> of it without
hurt. By the by, I have forgotten
the measure. Run, Benigna, and fetch
a <i>cyathus</i> (a ladle-cup) to help out the
wine."</p>

<p>"Jabber and cackle!" said the
hostess. "Crispus, this lady is the
widow, and these are the son and
daughter of Paulus Ãmilius Lepidus."</p>

<p>The landlord, in the full career of
his own jabber, was stricken mute for
a moment. He gazed at each of our
three travellers in turn, looking very
fixedly at Paulus. At last he said,</p>

<p>"This, then, accounts for the wonderful
likeness. My lady, I will never
take one brass coin from you or yours;
not an <i>as</i>, so help me! You must
command in this house. Do not think
otherwise."</p>

<p>And, apparently to prevent Aglais
from answering him, he drew his wife
hastily out of the room, and closed
the door.</p>

<p>Benigna was left behind, and, with
winning smiles and a flutter of attentions,
the young girl now placed the
chairs, and began to cackle, as Crispus
would have expressed himself,
and to entreat the wanderers to take
that refreshment of which they stood
so much in need. They all had the
delicate and graceful tact to feel that
compliance with the kindness which
they had so providentially found was
the only way to return it which they
at present possessed.</p>

<p>It is historical to add that appetite
gave the same advice. Their hunger
was as keen as their tact. During
supper the mother and son spoke little;
but Agatha, both during the repast
and for some time afterward,
kept up a brisk conversation with
Benigna, for whom the child had taken
an inexpressible liking, and from
whom she drew, with unconscious
adroitness, the fact that she was engaged
to be married. That sudden
affection of sympathy which knit the
soul of David to that of Jonathan
seemed to have bound these two together.
The landlady's considerate
daughter at length advised Agatha to
defer further communications until she
should have a good night's rest. Paulus
seconded the recommendation,
and left his mother and sister with
their Greek slave Melena and with
Benigna, and retired to his own bedroom.
This chamber overlooked the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impluvium</i>, or inner court, whence the
incessant plash of the fountain was
heard soothingly through his lattice-window,
the horn slide of which he
left open. The bedroom of the ladies,
on the other hand, overlooked
the garden and bee-hives, to which
Crispina had alluded. The sitting
apartments, opening into each other,
in one of which they had supped,
stood between; all these rooms being
situated in the projecting west wing,
which they entirely filled. Thus closed
the day which had carried to their
destination the travellers from Thrace.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>Next morning when they met at
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jentaculum</i>, or breakfast, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
a marvellous improvement in Agatha's
looks. She had been the earliest out
of bed; had seen from her window,
under a brilliant sunshine, the beautiful
landscape unroll itself in the various
forms which the landlady had
truly though inadequately described;
and she then had run down into the
garden.</p>

<p>In due time&mdash;that is, very soon
afterward&mdash;she had been chased by
the bees, had fled, screaming and
laughing, with the hood of her <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ricinium</i>
drawn completely over the head
by way of helmet against the terrible
darts of her indignant pursuers, and
had been received in the arms of Benigna,
who had heard the cry of distress
and had flown to the rescue,
brandishing a long, reedy brush, like
the mosquito brushes of modern times.
Rallying in a bower of trellis-work
covered with ivy, whence a wooden
staircase led up to the first floor of
the house, by way of a landing or
platform, over which rose another bower
clad in the same ivy mantle&mdash;facing
round, I say, upon her enemy at
the foot of this staircase, she had soon
ventured once more into the garden
with Benigna, and the two girls, jabbering
and cackling much, had gathered
a large nosegay of autumnal
flowers. With this booty, which Benigna
had made so big that Agatha
could hardly hold it in her small and
elegant hands, the latter damsel had
returned to the bower, had seated
herself upon a bench, and had begun
to sort the flowers in the relative positions
which best showed their tints.
Here she relied upon gradation, there
upon contrast. Her delicate Greek
taste in the performance of this task
drew exclamations of delight from
Benigna.</p>

<p>"There!" the innkeeper's daughter
would cry; "how pretty! That is
the way! That so, and then that,
and that! They look quite different
now! Exactly! I never imagined it!"</p>

<p>When Agatha had finished the arrangement
to her own satisfaction, an
exploit which was nimbly achieved,
"Now, Benigna," said she, with her
pretty foreign accent, "sit down here;
just do, and tell me all about every
thing."</p>

<p>Benigna stared, and Agatha proceeded,</p>

<p>"So you are engaged to become
the wife of a very good and handsome
youth, who in himself is every
thing that can be admired, except
that, poor young man! he is not very
courageous, I understood you to say.
Now, that is not his fault, I suppose.
How can he help feeling afraid if he
does feel afraid?"</p>

<p>At this moment the voice of Crispina
was heard calling her daughter
to help in preparing the breakfast,
and Benigna, whom Agatha's last
words had thrown into some confusion,
as the same topic had done the
previous evening, made an excuse
and ran away, with the light of roses
vivid in her cheeks.</p>

<p>Agatha remained, and looked out
upon the garden, and beyond it upon
the sweet country, with its varied beauty.
She remained listening peacefully
and dreamingly to the hum of
bees, the twittering of birds, the voices
and footsteps in the inn, and inhaling
the perfumes of the nosegay which
she had arranged, and the cool freshness
of that pleasant morning hour,
when the sun behind her and behind
the house was throwing the shadows
of buildings, sheds, trees, and cattle
in long lines toward the Tyrrhenian
Sea. While thus calmly resting, admiring,
and musing, a lady in a dark
robe of poil, (<i>gausapa</i>,) with a very
pallid face and large black eyes, stood
suddenly in the doorway of the bower,
and blocked out the lovely prospect.
The stranger smiled, and, holding out
a bunch of flowers, said,</p>

<p>"My pretty young lady, I see that
the offering I have been culling for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
you has lost its value. You are rich
already. May I sit down in this pleasant
shady place a moment to rest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you may, certainly," said
Agatha.</p>

<p>"I suppose," resumed the stranger,
"that you belong to this house, my
little friend? I am a stranger, and
merely lodging&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are lodging, too, and strangers,"
answered Agatha.</p>

<p>"From your accent," continued the
other, "I judge you to be Greek."</p>

<p>"Mother is," replied Agatha; "but
brother calls himself a Roman knight,
and even noble."</p>

<p>"I knew it!" cried the lady; "you
have it written in your countenance.
I, too, am a noble lady; my name
is Plancina. Have you ever seen
Rome?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Ah! how you will be enchanted.
You must come to see me. I have a
house in Rome; such a pretty house,
full of such curious things! Ah!
when you see Rome, you will hold
your breath with wonder and delight.
I will make you so happy when you
come to see me in my pretty house."</p>

<p>"You are a very kind, good lady,
I should think," quoth Agatha, looking
up from her flowers, and gazing
long at the pallid face and the large
black eyes; "and if we go to Rome, I
and my mother will visit you, perhaps."</p>

<p>"My house is among the willows
and beeches of the Viminal Hill," said
the lady. "Remember two things&mdash;<i>Viminal
Hill</i>, with its beeches and its
willows, and <i>the Calpurnian House</i>,
where the Piso family have lived for
generations. My husband, Piso, has
had great losses at dice. I am rich
enough to spend a fortune every year
for half a century, and we have still
at our house all the pleasures that can
be thought of. What pains I will
take to amuse you! You cannot conceive
the splendors, dresses, games,
sports, shows, and beauties of Rome;
the theatres, the circus, the combats,
the great wild beasts of all sorts from
all countries, the dances&mdash;"</p>

<p>As she pronounced the word "dances,"
a youthful male voice was heard
at a little distance, saying, "While
they change horses here, we will stretch
our limbs by a stroll in the garden
behind the inn. Make haste, worthy
innkeeper; order your servants to be
brisk."</p>

<p>And almost at the same moment a
brilliantly beautiful, dark, eastern-looking
girl, in a Syrian costume, appeared
at the entrance of the bower. Behind
her came sauntering the youth
whose voice had been heard. He
was of about Paulus's age, had an
olive complexion, was sumptuously
dressed, and exhibited a strong family
likeness in face to the girl. Last followed
a woman in middle life, appareled
in costly robes, suited to travel,
haughty, languid, and scornful of
mien.</p>

<p>Plancina and Agatha looked up
and surveyed the new-comers. The
brilliant damsel remained at the entrance
of the bower examining its
occupants with a hardy, unabashed
glance; whereupon Plancina, after a
moment's pause, occasioned by the
interruption, resumed and concluded
her sentence thus,</p>

<p>"No, you can form no idea of the
gayeties of Rome; the games, the
shows, the theatres, the glories, the
pleasures, the jests, the <i>dances</i>."</p>

<p>"But all your good dances come
from foreign lands&mdash;from the east,
indeed," interrupted the damsel, nodding
her head repeatedly and sneeringly;
"you must admit that."</p>

<p>"Not <i>all our good</i> alone," answered
Plancina sternly, noticing that the
woman in middle life smiled approvingly
at the girl who had obtruded
the remark; "not <i>all our good</i> alone,
but <em>all</em>. The office of the outside
world is to try and amuse Rome."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what is Rome's office?" asked
the damsel.</p>

<p>"To be amused by them, if she
can," answered the Roman.</p>

<p>"Come away, Herodias," said the
haughty, languid, and scornful-looking
woman; and the two strolled
down the middle walk of the garden.
The youth who had come with them
lingered a moment or two behind,
standing in the middle of the gravel-walk
and gazing straight into the
bower, while he flirted a sort of horse-whip
around the heads of one or two
tall flowers which were growing outside
along the border of the walk.</p>

<p>Plancina looked steadily at him,
and he at her. The lad withdrew
after a few moments, without a change
of feature.</p>

<p>"What starers!" muttered Agatha.</p>

<p>"They have a talent for it, indeed,"
said Plancina. "A hardy family,
putting one thing with another. I
think I know who they are. The
mother, if she were the mother, called
the daughter, if she were the daughter,
Herodias. My husband thinks of
going to Syria, and indeed Tiberius
has offered him the procuratorship
of Judea; but he would not condescend
to go in any smaller capacity
than as prefect of Syria. An acquaintance
of ours, <i>young Pontius Pilate</i>,
wants to get the procuratorship. The
minor office would be a great thing
for <em>him</em>. But my husband, Piso of
the Calpurnians, cannot stoop to
<em>that</em>. I may meet yonder family
again."</p>

<p>"Those people are looking back,"
observed Agatha, who had paid very
little attention to her companion's
speech.</p>

<p>Plancina rose, and, going to the
entrance of the bower, honored the
strangers with a steady glance. The
scornful-looking foreign woman in
sumptuous apparel met it for a moment,
and then turned away. Her
son and daughter turned away at the
same time.</p>

<p>"Ah! they are gone," murmured
Agatha; "they do not like you to
gaze so at them."</p>

<p>"It is but a Roman," returned
Plancina, "looking at barbarians.
They always shrink in that curious
manner. And why this Greek lunacy?"
muttered she; "and why this
Attic mania?"</p>

<p>"Attic what?" asked the half-Greek
girl.</p>

<p>"Nothing, my dear," replied Plancina;
"only you are not Greek, you
know; your father's race and the
name you bear settle that question;
your very mother is now, and has
long since become, a Roman citizen;
you must always prefer Rome to
Greece; never forget that rule, or you
and yours will perish."</p>

<p>Agatha opened wide the ingenuous
young eyes, and seemed to be most
seriously alarmed.</p>

<p>Plancina smoothed her pale brows,
which had been frowning; and continued
with a stern smile,</p>

<p>"I am only giving you a friend's
warning. Your mother and brother
have a suit to urge at court. There
exists a pestilent Greek faction which
are all doomed to destruction; tell
your mother that you must all beware
of being mixed up with them, and
you will escape their perdition. A
Greek, like your mother, with something
to ask, is peculiarly liable to
make the mistake of seeking Greek
friends. If she do, she is utterly lost,
however powerful may seem the prince
who patronizes the accursed cabal."</p>

<p>Agatha shrank and trembled, murmuring
like an echo Plancina's last
adjective&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exitiabilis</i>.</p>

<p>"Do not stare at me so, my little
dear," continued Plancina. "There
is the Prince Germanicus. Only for
him&mdash;every body knows it, and every
body says it; the thing is no secret&mdash;Piso,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
my husband, would be now prefect
of Syria; and like Crispus Sallust,
when I was a little girl, would
have recovered ten times the fortune
out of which he has been cheated
at dice. I am called a rash, violent,
and an untamable woman. The moment,
however, that any body gives
you any information about court parties
and political factions, every thing
I am saying will be mentioned. I
do not hide my disgust. Foreign
barbarians of all sorts swarm; they
creep through postern doors; they
privately influence all the destinies of
that world of which Romans have the
name publicly of being masters. We
are trodden under the feet of Greeks,
Jews, and Chaldeans; the first beat
us by genius, by eloquence, and artistic
skill, by general intellectual force
and subtlety; the second by superstition-inspired
obstinacy, by incredible
and unspeakable importunity, by steadfastness
in sordid servility, by sorcery,
divination, necromancy, and delusion;
not all delusion, I grant you; for I
myself have seen the demons of Thrasyllus,
the Babylonish Greek."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Agatha, "seen demons?
And what does a Babylonish
Greek mean?"</p>

<p>"A Greek initiated in the Babylonish
mysteries."</p>

<p>"And who is Thrasyllus?"</p>

<p>"A magician."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"A man who calls demons and spirits
of the air, as you would call your
pet birds, and they come to him."</p>

<p>"May the unknown God love me!"
cried Agatha, shuddering. "What
are the demons like?"</p>

<p>"Not like our sculptures, believe
me," answered Plancina. "I dare
not tell you; I have seen what no
words can say."</p>

<p>She paused, shrugged her shoulders,
and then added,</p>

<p>"Some forms were like the human,
with red fire in the veins instead of
blood, and white fire in the bones instead
of marrow; eyes they possessed
that had no comfort in them.
They had the air of being utterly
without interest in any thing, only
that their eyes were filled with fear;
yet it seemed to me with knowledge,
too: unspeakable fear, immense knowledge;
wells and pools they appeared,
full of fear and knowledge. When
they glanced upon you, there were
pale rays of hatred strangely combined
with an expression of indifference,
fear, knowledge, and hatred. If you
looked at the eyes, when they looked
not at you, you saw nothing but an
expression of fear and knowledge;
but when they did look at you, you
saw fear, knowledge, and hatred too.
All these faces mocked without smiling,
and scoffed without enjoyment.
Something, I thought, was dripping
down the wan cheeks, and there was
a look of fixed surprise long ago, of
long-past astonishment&mdash;the trace left,
and the feeling gone. The emotion
of boundless amazement had once
been there; the signs of it were left
all over the countenance, but, if I
may so speak, petrified&mdash;an immedicable
scar, an ineffaceable vestige.
The character of the countenance was
that of a dead astonishment&mdash;the astonishment
was dead; it was no longer
an active sentiment. It had been
some boundless wonder; the greatest
which that creature had ever experienced,
and the event which had caused
it had apparently been the most
serious which that being had ever
known."</p>

<p>"What a truly tremendous description!"
exclaimed Agatha.</p>

<p>The other made no reply; and before
any further conversation could
occur between them, a young man,
in the dark-brown habiliments of a
slave, entered the garden from the
inn, and after a hasty glance in various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
directions, approached the bower.
His features were very good; he
was well made, of a pleasing address,
and had a look of uncommon intelligence.
He possessed, in a small degree,
and a humble way, that undefinable
air of elegance which mental
culture sheds over the countenance;
but with this advantage he betrayed
certain symptoms of awkwardness and
timidity. Standing at a little distance
from the door of the arbor, he made
a low bow to Plancina, and said he
was the bearer of some commands.</p>

<p>"Commands from whom?" she demanded.</p>

<p>He answered, bowing low again,
by merely stating that his name was
Claudius.</p>

<p>Plancina instantly rose, and took
leave of Agatha, enjoining her not to
forget the warnings and counsels she
had given. Agatha then saw her
hastily reÃ«nter the hotel, followed
by the handsome slave. Thereupon,
buoyantly recovering her spirits, which
the presence and the words of this
woman had depressed, she ascended
the staircase to the landing overhead,
where she was joined by her mother
from the room within.</p>

<p>Agatha immediately told Aglais
every thing which had passed between
her and Plancina.</p>

<p>"I don't think, my dear child, we
shall be likely to trouble her in her
nice house among the willows and
beeches of the Viminal Hill," said
Aglais; and as Paulus now came out
upon the landing, a second edition
of the narrative was produced for his
information.</p>

<p>"Germanicus," said he, "is more
like the last of the Romans than in
any sense reprehensible or degenerate
in his tastes. His love for Greece
and his admiration for Athens are an
honor to his understanding. They
are nothing else. This has nothing
to do with preferring barbarians and
barbarous influences. My education,
<i>edepol!</i> has to be completed; but I
am educated enough to know that
Rome goes for schooling to Greece
as much as ever she did. Was not
Julius CÃ¦sar himself what they call
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">GrÃ¦culus</i>? I rather think he was
even deeper than Germanicus in Greek
lore; but, therefore, all the more fitted
for Roman command. The Romans
continued to be barbarians long after
the Greeks had become the teachers
of the world; and were it not for
Greece, they would be barbarians still.
As for warning us not to dare to make
friends for ourselves of this person or
that, or of any who appreciate intellect&mdash;for
this means to appreciate
Greeks&mdash;it is like warning us to remain
friendless, in order that we may
the more easily be crushed. It is the
wolf's advice to the sheep, to send
away her dogs; but I am more dog
than that myself. This pale, beetle-browed
lady ought to have enjoined
those to be timid who know how.
Dare do this! Dare do that! For
my part, I am not afraid to do any
thing that I think right."</p>

<p>His mother pressed Paulus's hand
affectionately, and his sister's high
spirit, which had cowered under the
dreadful conversation of Plancina,
shone in her eyes as she smiled at
him.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, in the large room within,
breakfast had been prepared for
the wanderers on a table drawn opposite
to and near the open folding-doors
of the arbor where they were conversing;
and the landlady now summoned
them to partake of that repast.</p>

<p>After breakfast, at which Crispina
herself waited on them, Agatha asked
where Benigna was.</p>

<p>The landlady smiled, and stated
that a friend of her daughter's had
called, and was doubtless detaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
her, but she would go at once and
bring the girl.</p>

<p>"On no account," interposed Aglais;
"Benigna, I dare say, will unfold
to my daughter all about it by
and by. Unless you have some pressing
business to take you immediately
away, will you kindly inform us of
the news, if there be any, and let us
sit in the arbor while you tell us?"</p>

<p>Accordingly they went into the
bower on the landing overlooking the
garden, and Crispina told them the
news.</p>

<p>In the first place, she told them
that the emperor's expected visit to
FormiÃ¦ was delayed on account of
the state of his health. It was now
thought he would not arrive for two
or three days more, whereas he was
to have entered FormiÃ¦ that very
morning. Crispina added, that it
would not surprise her if he did not
come for a week yet.</p>

<p>In the second place, Queen Berenice
with her son, Herod Agrippa,
and her daughter Herodias, who were
to have occupied those very apartments,
had arrived at the inn, but
had now gone forward.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Agatha, "those
must have been the persons who, an
hour ago, looked into the arbor below
this one, when that pale woman
was talking to me. The elder called
the younger Herodias."</p>

<p>"The same," continued the landlady.
"Finding that they cannot be
accommodated in my house, young
Herod has proposed to proceed with
all their train to FormiÃ¦, where&mdash;royal
though they be&mdash;they will be
nobody's guests; and as there is not
a place of public entertainment in
that town, and the weather is delightful,
he says they will pitch two or three
tents, and one splendid pavilion of
silk, on the verge of the green space
outside of FormiÃ¦, where the games
are to be held."</p>

<p>"Only fancy!" cried Agatha, clapping
her little hands.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Crispina told them, with
fifty gossiping details, that the entertainments
to be given in honor of the
emperor and the opulent knight Mamurra,
from whom the town took its
name, would be stupendous. FormiÃ¦,
we may mention, was frequently called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mamurrarum</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">urbs mamurrana</i>,
from the colonel or chiliarch Mamurra.
This gentleman had devoted his boyhood
and youth to the cause of Julius
CÃ¦sar, and afterward of Augustus in
the civil wars; had gained considerable
military reputation, and, above all,
had amassed enormous wealth.</p>

<p>He had long since returned to his
native FormiÃ¦, where he had built a
superb palace of marble, good enough
for an emperor. In that palace the
emperor was now to be his guest.
He and Agrippa Vipsanius, the founder
of the Pantheon, had long before
been among those by whom, in compliance
with the often-announced wish
of Augustus, not peculiarly addressed
to them, but generally to all his wealthy
countrymen, Augustus had expended
incalculable sums in adorning Rome
with public edifices, for which costly
materials, and the science and taste
of the best architects, had alike been
employed. As Augustus himself said,
(for himself,) "They had found it of
bricks, and were leaving it of marble."</p>

<p>"I have read verses by Catullus
upon this knight Mamurra," said Aglais.</p>

<p>"So you have, my lady," replied
Crispina. "Well, he has just knocked
up a circus in the fields adjoining FormiÃ¦,
and is preparing to exhibit magnificent
shows to his neighbors and
to all comers, in honor of the emperor's
visit to the town of the Mamurras
and the Mamurran palace. Tiberius
CÃ¦sar, who is also to be the
knight's guest, promises to use this
same circus, and to give entertainments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of his own there, and Germanicus
CÃ¦sar, before marching north
to fight the Germans, and drive them
out of north-eastern Italy, is to review
at FormiÃ¦ the troops destined
for that expedition, as well as the
great bulk of the prÃ¦torian guards
under Sejanus. The guards are uncertain
what portion of them the CÃ¦sar
may take with him northward."</p>

<p>"Mother, we shall see the shows,
we shall see the shows!" cried Agatha.</p>

<p>"Oh! and I am so slow. There
is another ingredient yet in my wallet
of tidings," exclaimed Crispina; "and
only think of my almost forgetting to
remember it."</p>

<p>"Remember not to forget it," said
the Greek girl, holding up her finger
with an admonishing and censorious
look at the landlady. "What is this
particular which you have, after all,
not forgotten to remember?"</p>

<p>"My charming little lady, it is a
particular which concerns the land of
your mother, and the people of Greece;
for seldom, say they, has that land
or people sent to Rome any body like
him."</p>

<p>"You accused yourself of being
slow; but now you gallop. Like
whom?"</p>

<p>"Like this noble young Athenian."</p>

<p>"Galloping still faster," rejoined
Agatha.</p>

<p>"What noble young Athenian?"</p>

<p>"This Athenian, gifted as his countryman
Alcibiades, eloquent as our
own Tully, acute and profound as
Aristotle, honorable as Fabricius,
truthful as Regulus, and O ladies!
with all these other excellencies, beautiful
as a poem, a picture, a statue, or
a dream!"</p>

<p>"There's a description," quoth Agatha,
laughing.</p>

<p>"More eloquent than precise, I
think," said Paulus.</p>

<p>"Yet sufficiently precise," added
Aglais, "to leave us in no doubt at
all who is meant by it. It must be
young Dionysius; it must be <i>Dion</i>."</p>

<p>"That is the very name!" exclaimed
the hostess.</p>

<p>"My mother knows him," said Paulus.
"My sister and I have often
heard of him; so have thousands;
but we have not seen him. It is he
who carried away all the honors of
the great Lyceum at Athens on the
left bank of the Ilissus."</p>

<p>"The right bank, brother," said
Agatha; "don't you remember, the
day we embarked at the PirÃ¦us
somebody showed it to us, just opposite
Diana Agrotera, which is on the
left bank?"</p>

<p>"It is all the same," said Paulus.</p>

<p>"Mother, just tell Paulus if left and
right are all the same," said Agatha.
"That is like Paulus. They are not
the same; they never were the same."</p>

<p>"All the ladies at the Mamurran
palace," resumed the hostess, "make
toilets against him."</p>

<p>"Toils, you mean," said Paulus.</p>

<p>"Yes, toils," continued the hostess.
"They are intended as toils for him;
they are great toils and labors for the
poor girls; the <i>ornatrius</i> and they are
toilers for the fair dames themselves."</p>

<p>"It is all the same," again quoth
Paulus.</p>

<p>"And how do these toilets prosper
against Dionysius the Athenian?"</p>

<p>"They tell me he is not aware of
the admiration he excites&mdash;is totally
indifferent to it."</p>

<p>"Base, miserable youth!" cried Paulus,
laughing. "These Roman dames
and damsels ought to punish him."</p>

<p>"You mean by letting him alone?"
asked the landlady.</p>

<p>"No; that would kill him," returned
Paulus with a sneer, "being what
he is."</p>

<p>"Then how punish him?" asked
she.</p>

<p>"By pursuing him with their blandishments,"
answered Paulus; "that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
if they can muster sufficient ferocity.
But I fear the women are too kind
here in Italy. I am told that even
in the midst of the most furious passions,
and while the deadliest agonies
are felt by others around them, their
natural sweetness is so invincible that
they smile and send soft glances to
and fro; they look more bewitching
at misery (such is their goodness) than
when they see no suffering at all.
Yes, indeed! and as the gladiators
fight, they have a lovely smile for
each gash; and when the gladiator
dies, their eyes glisten enchantingly.
We have not these entertainments in
Greece, and the Greek Dion must
soon feel the superiority of the Roman
to the Greek woman. Pity is a beautiful
quality in a woman; and the
Greek ladies do not seek the same
frequent opportunities of exercising it
as the Italian ladies possess, and, <i>eheu!</i>
enjoy."</p>

<p>"Is Paulus bitter?" asked Aglais.
"Is Paulus witty?"</p>

<p>"Talking of wit, my lady," pursued
the hostess, "none but our dear old
Plautus could have matched this young
Athenian, as Antistius Labio, the great
author of five hundred volumes, has
found to his cost."</p>

<p>"Labio! Why, that must be the
son of one of those who murdered
CÃ¦sar," exclaimed Paulus. "My father
met his father foot to foot at the
battle of Philippi; but he escaped, and
slew himself when Brutus did so."</p>

<p>"That was indeed this man's father,"
said Crispina. "The son is a
very clever man, and a most successful
practitioner in the law courts.
Wishing to mortify Dionysius, he said
in his presence, at a review of the
troops at FormiÃ¦ yesterday, that he
was grateful to the gods he had not
been born at Athens, and was no
Greek&mdash;not he!</p>

<p>"'The Athenians also entertain,'
replied Dionysius, 'the idea which
you have just expressed.'</p>

<p>"'What idea?' asked Antistius Labio.</p>

<p>"'<i>That their gods watch over them</i>,'
replied Dionysius. Ah my lady!
you should have heard the laughter
at Labio; the very centurions turned
away to conceal their grins. Some
one high at court then took the Athenian's
arm on one side, and Titus Livius's
on the other, and walked off
with them. Labio did not say a
word."</p>

<p>"Pray can you tell us, good Crispina,
whether Germanicus CÃ¦sar is
to be a guest of the knight Mamurra?"
asked Paulus.</p>

<p>The landlady said she believed he
would be for a day or two, and that
she thought it was even he who had
taken Dion's and Livy's arm, and
walked with them apart.</p>

<p>"It is some time," said Aglais,
"since Catullus indited those epigrammatic
verses against the hospitable and
opulent knight. This Mamurra must
be very old."</p>

<p>"Yet, my lady," replied Crispina,
"he has a ruddy face, a clear complexion,
and downright black eyebrows."</p>

<p>"There is a wash called <i>lixirium</i>,"
said Aglais with a meaning smile.</p>

<p>"Ah! but," cried Crispina, laughing
with no less knowing a look,
"that makes the hair yellow; and the
brows of the knight are as black as
the jet ornaments in your daughter's
hair."</p>

<p>"You can tell us, no doubt," said
Paulus, "who those ladies must be
that came with Tiberius CÃ¦sar yesterday
from that splendid mansion on
the Liris. They were in beautiful
litters; one of sculptured bronze, the
other of ivory, embossed with gold
reliefs."</p>

<p>"I know who they are, of course,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
said the landlady; "they are half-sisters,
the daughters of the late renowned
warrior and statesman, the builder
of the Pantheon, Agrippa Vipsanius,
but by different mothers. One of
them was the wife of Tiberius CÃ¦sar."</p>

<p>"Was!" exclaimed Paulus; "why,
she's not a ghost?"</p>

<p>"She is, nevertheless; her husband
has another wife," said the landlady;
adding, in a low voice, "a precious
one, too; the emperor has required
him to marry the august Julia."</p>

<p>"The august!" murmured Aglais
contemptuously, with a shrug of the
shoulders; "getting old, too."</p>

<p>"I am sure," resumed the landlady,
"no one can describe the relationships
of that family. Agrippa Vipsanius,
you must know, married three
times. His second wife was Marcella,
daughter of Augustus's sister,
Octavia; and this Marcella became
the mother of the elder of the two
ladies whom you saw. Well, while
this Marcella was still living, but after
she had had a daughter called Vipsania,
Augustus made Agrippa put
her away to marry, mind you, this
very same august Julia, Augustus's
own daughter, and therefore Marcella's
first cousin. This Julia, who
had just become a widow, having lost
her first husband Marcellus, is the
mother of the other lady whom you
saw, who is called Julia Agrippina,
and who thus came into the world
the second cousin of her own half-sister.
Well, Agrippa, the father of
both girls, leaving the august Julia a
widow for the second time, Tiberius
CÃ¦sar marries Agrippa's eldest daughter
Vipsania, and has a son by her,
called Drusus; and now, while Vipsania
is still living, Augustus makes
Tiberius put her away to marry the
aforesaid august Julia, the mother of
the younger daughter, Julia Agrippina,
who is Tiberius's first and likewise
second cousin."</p>

<p>"I can hardly follow you in the
labyrinth," said Aglais.</p>

<p>"No one can, my lady, except
those who make a study of it," said
the landlady, laughing; "but it's all
true. Julia, Augustus's daughter, is
the wife of the father of both these
girls, first cousin to the eldest of them,
mother and cousin-in-law of the younger,
and has now also been made wife
to the husband of the elder, her own
first cousin, and become the sister-in-law
of her own daughter and cousin-in-law
to the younger."</p>

<p>"Medius fidius!" cried Paulus, staring
stupidly, "what a tremendous
twisted knot! Julia's daughter, half-sister,
and second cousin is put away,
that the half-sister's husband may
marry the half-sister's stepmother and
second cousin, or something like that."</p>

<p>"Or something like that," continued
Crispina; "but there is no end to
it. Tiberius CÃ¦sar is now father-in-law
and brother-in-law to one woman,
and the husband and stepfather-in-law
to another, while the mother of
the younger half-sister becomes the
sister-in-law of her own daughter."</p>

<p>At this moment Agatha, who was
opposite the outer door of the embowered
landing, leading down by a
flight of stairs into the garden, through
the other arbor before mentioned, suddenly
exclaimed, "There's Benigna
walking in the garden with a man!"</p>

<p>They all looked, and saw Benigna
and a young man, wearing a brown
tunic and slippers, in a distant alley
of fig-trees, talking earnestly as they
strolled together. Crispina smiled
and said, "I must really tell you that
my Benigna's betrothed lover came
here unexpectedly at daybreak. He
has obtained a week's holiday, and
will spend it, he vows, in the inn.
We have had to use some skill, I promise
you, in finding room for him.
He is to sleep in a big trunk with the
lid off, stowed away in the angle of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
corridor behind a curtain. He is a
very good and well-instructed youth,
knows Greek, and is severely worked
as one of the secretaries of Tiberius
CÃ¦sar, whose slave he is, as I think
Benigna has mentioned to my little
Lady Agatha yonder."</p>

<p>"When is the marriage of dear
Benigna to take place?" asked Agatha.</p>

<p>"Of course the poor young man,"
replied Crispina, "cannot marry until
he gets his freedom. Whenever Tiberius
CÃ¦sar allows him to shave his
head, and put on the <i>pileus</i>, (cap of
liberty,) we shall have a merry wedding."</p>

<p>"What sort of master is Tiberius
CÃ¦sar?" asked Paulus.</p>

<p>The landlady said she was thankful
she did not personally know him;
but she had never heard any complaint
of him made by Claudius, her
future son-in-law.</p>

<p>"Your future son-in-law, Claudius!"
exclaimed Agatha in amazement.
"Then it was your future son-in-law
who had something to say to that
Dame Plancina, with the pale face
and black eyebrows?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of, my little lady,"
returned the hostess.</p>

<p>"Ah! but he had, though," persisted
Agatha. "He came to the arbor
door, and distinctly stated, with
a low bow, that he had commands
for that lady; and then she said from
whom; and he said, my name is Claudius;
that is what he said; and then
she jumped up in a remarkable fluster
and went into the house, and he
followed her. But then why she
should jump up in a fluster, because
a slave said his name was Claudius,
I can't imagine," concluded Agatha,
pondering.</p>

<p>The hostess looked surprised.</p>

<p>"I think it could not be because a
slave's name was Claudius," she said;
"nor do I understand it."</p>

<p>"Is that your demon-seeing dame,
Agatha?" asked Paulus, stretching
himself; "for I have a notion that
when I parried the fellow's blow who
wanted to cut me down in so cowardly
a fashion, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There was a female scream; do
you remember it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I have been thinking the
woman who screamed was a woman
whom your description of that fierce
dame in the arbor exactly fits. If
so, she was in the train of Tiberius,
and of those ladies of whom our good
hostess has just given us such an interesting
genealogical and matrimonial
account."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps the commands for
Plancina were from Tiberius CÃ¦sar,"
quoth Agatha.</p>

<p>Crispina shook her head, but appeared
a little serious. A short silence
followed. Paulus broke it by
asking the landlady to get a letter
forwarded for him to the military tribune,
Velleius Paterculus, at FormiÃ¦.
"I wish," he said, "to take advantage
of the delay in the emperor's
visit, and to see the country, to fish
in the river, to move about far and
near; provided Paterculus, to whom
I have given a promise to report myself,
has no objection."</p>

<p>The hostess brought him some <i>liviana</i>,
or second-class paper, the best
she had, some cuttle-fish ink, and a
reed pen, told him to write his letter,
and undertook to transmit it at once
by a runner belonging to the hostelry.
She then left the room.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p>The letter was sent, and in the
course of the forenoon the <i>tabellarius</i>,
or letter-carrier of the inn, returned
from FormiÃ¦. Crispina brought him
to Paulus, who was in an avenue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the garden watching some players as
they contested a game of quoits or
<i>discus</i>. This avenue connected the
garden proper with the open country
westward, terminating in a cross-hedge
of myrtle, through which a little wicket
or trellis gate opened. "The man
has brought no letter back," the hostess
said, signing at the same time to
the messenger to deliver the particulars
of his errand.</p>

<p>He had found the tribune, he said,
and had given him the letter and
asked for an answer. The tribune
was at the moment inspecting a body
of troops. He read the note, however,
and immediately took out of his
belt both his <i>stylus</i> and <i>pugillaria</i>, or
hand-tablets; when the prÃ¦torian prefect
Sejanus, happening to pass, entered
into conversation with him, and
the messenger then saw Velleius Paterculus
hand to Sejanus Paulus's letter.
After reading it, the general gave
it back, said something in Greek, and
went away. The tribune thereupon
told the bearer that he would send
an answer during the day by a messenger
of his own. Paulus thanked
the man, who then withdrew.</p>

<p>Our hero, who had prepared his
fishing-tackle, a portion of which he
had in his hand, remarked that it was
vexatious to lose so fine and favorable
a day. "Moreover, why should
I be a prisoner?" he suddenly exclaimed.
"I have a triple right to
my personal liberty, as Roman citizen,
knight, and noble. And what
have I done to forfeit it? What have
I done except parry the blow of an
assassin whom I neither injured nor
provoked?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" murmured Crispina; and
just then Cneius Piso, having a bandage
round his head, and leaning on
the arm of Plancina, was seen passing
into the inn before them from another
part of the garden.</p>

<p>The landlady stood still a moment,
till the two figures had disappeared,
when she said, with a slight motion of
the thumb in the direction of Piso,
"He reports himself quite well now
except for a headache. He and his
lady leave us in an hour for Rome,
and I hope I may say both <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vale</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salve</i>. You ask what you have
done. Have you not come to Italy
to claim rights which are indisputable?"</p>

<p>"Is that reason?"</p>

<p>"It is a thousand reasons, and another
thousand, too. Alas! do not
deceive yourself, as your namesake
and cousin did, about the character
of the world."</p>

<p>At the door of the inn they separated,
she to attend to the multifarious
business of her household, and
he to loiter purposelessly. After a
little reflection, he went quite through
the house by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impluvium</i>, and the
central corridor beyond it, and looked
into the public room, or <i>atrium</i>.
At one table a couple of centurions
sat playing dice with the <i>tesserÃ¦</i>, and
shouting the names of half a dozen
gods and goddesses, as their luck fluctuated.
At another table a powerfully
built, dark, middle-aged man,
having a long, ruddy beard streaked
with gray, upon whom Asiatic slaves
waited, was taking a traveller's repast;
his slaves helping him to costly wine,
which he drank with a grimace of
dissatisfaction, but in formidable quantities.
Other groups were dotted
round the large apartment. In order
not to draw needless notice, for all
eyes turned to him for a moment, except
those of the two dice-throwing
and bellowing centurions, Paulus seated
himself behind an unoccupied table
near the door. While idly watching
the scenes around him, he thought
he heard his name pronounced in the
passage outside. He listened, but
the noise in the room made him uncertain,
and the voice outside was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
less audible, as of one who had
passed the door while speaking.</p>

<p>Presently he heard, in a much louder
tone, the words, "Why, it is not
our carriage, after all. Let us return
and wait where we can sit down."
And the speaker again passed the
public room, coming back, apparently,
from the porch.</p>

<p>Paulus happened to be sitting close
to the door, which was open; a curtain,
as was common, hanging over
the entrance. This time, in spite of
the noise in the dieta, a word or two,
and a name, though not his own, struck
him. He fancied some one said, "No
harm to her; but still, not the brother&mdash;the
sister, my trusty Claudius."</p>

<p>Where had Paulus heard those tones
before? In itself, what he had overheard
was a sufficiently harmless fragment
of a sentence. Nevertheless,
Paulus rose, left his table, lifted aside
the door-curtain, and went into the
corridor, where he saw Cneius Piso
and Plancina, with their backs to him,
walking toward the end of the passage
opposite the porch, but he nearly
stumbled against a young man going
the other way. This person, who
was good-looking, in both senses of
the word, wore the sober-colored <i>exomis</i>,
or tunic, the long hair, and the
slippers of a slave. He had in his
right hand a stylus; in his left, tablets
of citron-wood, open and covered
with blue wax, on which he was reading,
with his head bent, some note
which he had made there.</p>

<p>"It is my fault, noble sir," said he;
"I was stooping over these and did
not observe you; I beg you to pardon
my awkwardness." And he bowed
with an air of humility.</p>

<p>"It is I, rather, who am to blame,"
said Paulus, scanning steadily the features
of the slave, who had made
his apology with a look of alarm, and
in exaggerated accents of deprecation.</p>

<p>Shortly after this incident, while
Paulus, who had not returned to the
<i>atrium</i>, was leaning dreamily over the
balustrade of the inn's central court,
and watching the fountain in the impluvium
there, he was struck heavily
on the shoulder from behind by an
open hand. Turning round slowly,
he beheld a man in the very prime of
life, who was entirely a stranger to him.</p>

<p>"I was told I should find you here,
excellent sir," said the stranger.</p>

<p>Paulus took in, at a glance, his
dress and general appearance. He
had a thick brown beard, neatly trimmed,
and open, daring, large blue
eyes, in which there was nothing
whatever sullen or morose; yet a sort
of wildness and fierceness, with a
slight but constant gleam of vigilance,
if not subtlety. On the whole, his
face was handsome; it was conspicuously
manful, and, perhaps, somewhat
obdurate and pitiless.</p>

<p>His stature was good without being
very lofty. He had broad shoulders,
rather long, sinewy arms, a deep chest,
and, altogether, a figure and person
not lacking any token of agility, but
more indicative of huge strength.</p>

<p>He wore sandals, the laces of which
crossed each other up his mighty legs,
which were otherwise bare, and a
white woollen <i>diphera</i> covered his
shoulders, and was belted round his
waist.</p>

<p>"And who told you that you would
find me here?" asked Paulus; "for a
few minutes ago I did not know I
should find myself here."</p>

<p>"There goes the youth who told
me," answered the other pointing, and
at the same moment Paulus saw the
slave, against whom he had walked
in the passage, cross on tiptoe an
angle of the court-yard, and vanish
through a door on the opposite side.</p>

<p>"Claudius," continued the stranger,
"is an acquaintance of mine, and
chancing to meet him as I entered
the hostelry, I asked for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"And pray who are you, and what
do you want with me?" asked Paulus,
after the slave, who must, he now
felt sure, be the Claudius to whom
Benigna was betrothed, had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Who am I?" returned the stranger;
"a good many people know my
name, and my person, too. But that
matters not for the present. Your
second question is more immediately
important. 'What do I want with
you?' To deliver to you a letter; nothing
more. Understanding that I
meant to stroll out in this direction,
the distinguished tribune, Velleius Paterculus,
requested me to hand you
this."</p>

<p>And he produced from a fold in
the breast of his white woollen tunic
a letter, having a written address on
one side, and a thread round its four
ends, which thread was knotted on
the side opposite to that bearing the
superscription. The knot was secured
by a waxen seal, upon which the
scholarly writer had, in imitation of
the deceased minister MÃ¦cenas, impressed
the engraving of a frog.</p>

<p>Paulus opened it and read what
follows:</p>

<p>"To the noble Paulus Ãmilius Lepidus,
the younger, Velleius Paterculus
sends greeting:</p>

<p>"Go where you like, amuse yourself
as you like, do as you like&mdash;fish,
ride, walk, read, play, sing&mdash;provided
you sleep each night at the Post
House of the Hundredth Milestone,
under the excellent Crispina's roof.
Be careful of your health and welfare."</p>

<p>"So far so good," said Paulus; "I
am a prisoner, indeed, but with a tolerable
long tether, at least. I am
much obliged to you for bringing me
the letter."</p>

<p>"Imprisonment!" observed the other.
"I have heard a knot of centurions,
and also soldiers unnumbered,
talk of your imprisonment, and of the
blow with which it seems to be connected.
You are a favorite, without
knowing it, among the troops at FormiÃ¦.
One fierce fellow swore, by
quite a crowd of gods, that your blow
deserved to have freed a slave, instead
of enslaving a knight; that is,
to have freed you had you been a
slave, instead of enslaving you, who
are already a knight."</p>

<p>"I feel grateful to the soldiers,"
said Paulus. "You are doubtless an
officer&mdash;a centurion, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Well, they do speak freely," replied
the stranger, "and so do I;
therefore you have made a fair guess;
but you are wrong."</p>

<p>"Ah! well," said Paulus; "thanks
for your trouble, and farewell. I must
go."</p>

<p>"One word," persisted the other.
"I am a famous man, though you do
not seem to know it. The conqueror
in thirty-nine single combats at
Rome, all of them mortal, and all
against the best gladiators that ever
fought in circus or in forum, stands
before you. At present I am no longer
obliged to fight in person. I keep
the most invincible <i>familia</i> of gladiators
that Rome has hitherto known.
You are aware of the change of morals
and fashions; you are aware that
even a senator has been seen in the
arena. Some day an emperor will descend
into our lists." (This, as the
reader knows, really happened in the
course of time.) "Join my family,
my school; I am Thellus, the lanista."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Paulus, his nostrils
dilated, and his eyes flashing. "In
Greece, where I have been bred, gladiatorial
shows are not so much as
allowed by law, even though the gladiators
should be all slaves; and because
some senator has forgotten the
respect due to the senate and to himself,
and has no sense either of decency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
or humanity, you dare to propose
to me, the nephew of a triumvir, the
son of an honorable and a famous soldier&mdash;to
me, the last of the Ãmilians,
to descend as a gladiator into the arena,
and to join your school, <i>mehercle!</i>
of uneducated, base-born, and mercenary
cut-throats!"</p>

<p>The lanista was so astounded by
this unexpected burst of lofty indignation,
and felt himself thrust morally
to such a sudden distance from the
stripling, at least in the appearance of
things, that he uttered not one word
for several instants. He glared in
speechless fury at the speaker, and
when at length he found voice and
ideas he said,</p>

<p>"Do you know that I could take
you in these unarmed hands, and tear
you limb from limb where you stand,
as you would rend a chicken&mdash;do you
know that?"</p>

<p>"I do not," said Paulus, in slow
and significant accents, facing round
at the same time upon the lanista
with deliberate steadiness, and looking
him fixedly in the face; "but if
you even could, it would suit my humor
better to be murdered where I
am by a gladiator than to be one."</p>

<p>"By the Capitoline Jove!" cried
Thellus, after another rather long,
doubtful pause, laughing vehemently,
"when I place your skill of fence,
about which I have heard a particular
account, by the side of your high
spirit, you really do make my mouth
water to number you among my pupils.
I have not a man in my <i>familia</i>
whom you would not, when a little
addition to your years shall have perfected
your bodily vigor, stretch upon
the sand in ten minutes. But what
mean you, after all? You do not
wish to hurt my feelings, because I
make you a friendly offer in the best
shape that my unlucky destiny and
state of life afford me the means of
doing? Do you, then, so utterly despise
the gladiator? Have you reflected
on it so deeply? Who, nevertheless,
displays in a greater degree
many of the severest and highest virtues?
Do you despise the man who
despises life itself, when compared
with honor in the only form in which
honor is for him accessible? Answer
that. Do you despise abstemiousness,
fortitude, self-control, self-sacrifice,
chastity, courage, endurance? Answer
that. Who is more dauntless in
the combat, more sublimely unruffled
when defeated, more invincibly silent
under the agony of a violent death,
accompanied by the hootings of pitiless
derision, and <em>whose</em> derision,
whose mockery, is the last sound in
his ears? <i>Let that pass.</i></p>

<p>"But who pays a dearer price for
the applause of his fellow-men when
it is his? Who serves them more
desperately in the way in which they
desire to be, and will needs be, served?
Who gives them the safe and cruel
pleasures they demand more ungrudgingly,
or under such awful conditions?
Who comes forward to be mangled
and destroyed with a more smiling
face, or a more indifferent mien?
Who spurns ease, and sloth, and
pleasure, and pain, and the sweet
things of life, and the bitter things of
death, in order to show what manhood
can dare and what manfulness
can do, and in order to be thoroughly
the man to the last, with the same
constant and unconquerable mind, as
the very gladiator whom you thus insult?
Women can often show <i>heroism</i>
in pain while shrinking from danger;
and, on the other hand, amidst
the general excitement and the contagious
enthusiasm of an army in
battle, to fight pretty well, and then
to howl without restraint in the surgeon's
hands, is the property of nearly
all men. Some who face danger
badly endure anguish well; and many,
again, who cannot support pain will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
confront danger. But if you wish to
name him who does both in perfection,
and who practises that perfection
habitually, you will name the
gladiator. Nor is it pain of body
alone, nor loss of life alone, which his
calling trains him to undergo with
alacrity. Are you sure that our motives
are simply and solely that grovelling
lust of gain which you imply?
<i>Mercenary</i> you dare to term us?
Mercenary! The gambler is mercenary.
Is the gladiator like your high-born
voluntary gambler? Is the gladiator
deaf to praise? Indifferent
to admiration? Reckless of your
sympathy? Is he without other
men's human ties and affections, as
the gambler is? Has the gladiator
no parents whom he feeds with that
blood which flows from his gashes?
No wife whom he is all the time protecting
with that lacerated and fearless
breast? No children whom his
toils, efforts, and sufferings are keeping
out of degradation, out of want,
and out of that very arena which he
treads with a spirit that nothing can
subdue, in order that those whom he
loves may never enter it?"</p>

<p>While Thellus thus thundered with
increasing and increasing vehemence,
the clear-faced youth whom he addressed,
and who had confronted his
words of menace without any emotion
except that of instinctive and settled
defiance, was and appeared to be
quite overwhelmed. Had Paulus been
struck bodily, he could not have felt
any thing like the pain he suffered.
The words of the gladiator smote the
lad full to the heart, like stones shot
from a catapult.</p>

<p>Thellus gazed thoughtfully at him
during the pause which ensued, and
then resumed by exclaiming,</p>

<p>"Mercenary! that is, he takes pay.
Does the author take pay? answer
that. Do the lawyer and soldier take
pay? Does the magistrate take pay?
Does, or does not, the emperor take
pay? Does the vestal virgin herself
take pay? If the gladiator did, and
suffered, and was all he does, all he
suffers, all he is, in mere sport, and
at his own personal expense, I suppose
you would respect him. But
I, Thellus&mdash;I, the gladiator&mdash;I, the
lanista&mdash;would scorn him, and spurn
him, and spit upon him. Blame the
community who go to these sports,
and sit in shameless safety; blame
the hundreds of thousands who succeed
other hundreds of thousands to
applaud us when we kill our beloved
comrades, and, at the same time, to
howl and hoot over those same brave
friends whom we kill; blame those
who, having cheered us when we slew
our faithful companions, yell at us in
our own turn when we are slain;
blame men for taking us when we are
little children, and rearing us expressly
to be fit for nothing else; blame
men for taking the little ones of captured
warriors who have in vain defended
their native lands against the
discipline and skill of Rome; blame
men for mingling these poor infants
in one college with the foundlings
and the slaves to whom law and
positive necessity bequeath but one
lot in this life; blame those who thus
provide for the deadly arena. Blame
your customs, blame your laws, blame
your tyrannous institutions, against
which the simplicity and trustfulness
of boyish years can neither physically
nor mentally struggle; blame, above
all, your fine dames, more degraded&mdash;ay,
far more degraded and more
abased than the famishing prostitutes
who must perish of starvation, or be
what they are; blame your fine dames,
I say, who when, like the august Julia,
they import the thick silks of India,
are not satisfied till they pick them
<i>thin</i> and transparent before wearing
them, lest their garments should conceal
their shame; and thus attired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
pampered with delicacies, gorged with
food, heated with wine, surfeited with
every luxury, reeking and horrible,
know not what else to do to beguile
the languid intervals of systematic
wickedness, than to come to the arena
and indulge in sweet emotions over
the valiant and virtuous fathers of
homes and hopes of families, who
perish there in torture and in ignominy
for their pleasure."</p>

<p>"O God!" cried young Paulus.</p>

<p>"Well may you," cried Thellus,
"be filled with horror. Ah! then,
when will a god descend from heaven,
and give us a new world? I have
one child in my home, a sweet, peaceful,
natural-hearted, conscience-governed,
loving little daughter. Her
mother has gone away from me for
ever to some world beyond death
where more justice and more mercy
prevail. The day when I lost her
I had to fight in the arena. <i>Eheu!</i>
She was anxious for me, she could
not control her suspense; she saw the
execrable Tiberius. Bah! do you think
I'm afraid to speak? Of what should
I be afraid? Thellus has been at
the funeral of fear; yes, this many a
day," continued Thellus, raising his
voice; "she came to the Statilian
amphitheatre against my express command;
she saw the execrable Tiberius,
contrary to every custom, after I had
been victor in four fatal encounters,
when I was worn out with fatigue,
order me to meet a fresh antagonist;
and looking up among the hundred
thousand spectators, I beheld the
sweet, loving face. I beheld the clasped
and convulsive fingers. But, lo,
who came forth to fight against me?
Whom had the accursed man provided
as my next antagonist? Her
only brother, poor Statius, whom Tiberius
knew to be a gladiator, and
whom he had thus selected for the
more refined excitement of the spectators
to fight against Thellus; but,
above all, for his own more refined
enjoyment, for the monster had tried
and found my poor Alba incorruptible;
and this was his revenge against
a wretched gladiator and his faithful
wife. Statius was no match for me;
I tried to disarm him; after a while I
succeeded, wounding him at the same
time slightly. He fell, and his blood
colored the sand. I looked to the
people; they looked to Tiberius, waiting
for the sign of mercy or execution.
I was resolved in any case not to be
the slayer of Statius.</p>

<p>"The prince turned up his thumb,
to intimate that I was to kill my
wounded opponent. The amphitheatre
then rang with a woman's scream,
and the people, with one impulse,
turned <em>down</em> their hands. I bore Statius
in my own arms out of the arena;
but when I reached home, I found my
wife was near childbirth, delirious, and
raving <i>against me</i> as the murderer of
her brother. She died so, in my arms
and in her brother's. She left me my
poor little Prudentia, who is dearer to
me than all this globe."</p>

<p>After taking breath, he added, quoting
Paulus's words,</p>

<p>"But we are a gang of base-born, uneducated,
and mercenary cut-throats."</p>

<p>"Oh! forgive, forgive, forgive my
words," exclaimed Paulus, stretching
out both hands toward the gladiator.</p>

<p>Thellus took those hands and said,</p>

<p>"Why, I love you, lad. I love
you like a son. I am not high-born
enough to be father to the like of you;
but it is not forbidden me to love a
noble youth who hates baseness and
is ignorant of fear. I'll tell you more;
but first answer me&mdash;are you of opinion,
from what has passed between
us, that Thellus is an uneducated
man?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you are better
educated than I am."</p>

<p>"In any case," replied Thellus, "I
am ready to confess that the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
and virtues exercised by gladiators
are exercised for a wrong purpose,
and in a wrong way. But tell me,
why is bread made? You will not
say because bakers bake it. That
would be a girl's answer; it would be
saying that a thing is because it is, or
is made because it is made. Why
is it made? Because it is wanted.
Would bakers bake it if nobody ate
it? If nobody wanted to live in a
house, would masons build any? or
would there even be any masons?
You could not, I grant, have music
if there were no musicians, if none
wanted music. It is the gladiator,
unquestionably, who does the fighting
in the arena; but if none wanted the
fighting, you would have no gladiators.
I have told you how we are
trepanned in helpless infancy; and
not only reared, prepared, and fitted
for this calling, but hopelessly unfitted
for every other. We supply the spectacle&mdash;but
who desires the spectacle?
It is not we; we are the only sufferers
by it; we detest it. But whatever in
so dreadful and wicked a pastime can
be noble, courageous, unselfish, heroic,
we the same, we the victims, give
and exhibit; and all the selfishness of
it, all that is cowardly in it, all that is
cruel, base, despicable, execrable, and
accursed, sits on the benches, and applauds
or yells in the wedges;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> this
you, <em>you</em>, who go thither, and bring
thither us, your victims, this you produce,
this is your contribution to it.
Ours is honor, valor, skill, and dauntless
death; yours, inhumanity, cowardice,
baseness, luxurious ease, and
a safe, lazy, and besotted life."</p>

<p>"It is true," said Paulus. "Hideous
are the pleasures, detestable the
glories of this gigantic empire; but
<i>unless, as you say, a God himself were
to come down from heaven</i>, how will it
ever be reformed?"</p>

<p>"How, indeed?" answered Thellus.</p>

<p>Little did they dream who a certain
Child in Syria was, who had then
entered his eleventh year!</p>

<h2>THE POPE AND THE COUNCIL, BY JANUS.</h2>


<p>Since the apostolic bull convoking
the General Council of the Vatican,
now in session, has been issued by
Pius IX., an immense literary activity
has manifested itself in most countries
about the great and important questions
which are supposed to claim
the attention of that august assembly
of the Catholic Church. Not only
Catholic, but also Protestant reviews
have engaged in various ways in the
discussion of matters relating to the
council. Very numerous, indeed, are
the pamphlets&mdash;nay, books and volumes
of greater import&mdash;that have
been published within the last ten
months in Italy, Belgium, France,
England, and Germany. It is particularly
in this latter country that
publications concerning more or less
the present council have been most
numerous, and prominent reviews have
given able and elaborate notices of
most of them. Several publications,
of this character have been rendered
accessible to Italian, French, and English
readers, thus exhibiting the importance
attached to them outside of
Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>It is our present purpose to enter
upon a closer examination of a work
which we have already briefly noticed
in a former number, we mean the
book, <cite>The Pope and the Council, by
Janus</cite>, of which an authorized translation
appeared both in England and
in this country.</p>

<p>We adduce this fact as a very peculiar
one, which will cause still greater
surprise to the reader when he is informed
that an authorized French
translation appeared but a short time
after the original itself.</p>

<p>The reader has already been told
what he is to think of the orthodoxy of
<i>Janus</i>, when his doctrines are judged
by the criterion established by the
church. But let us state here at once
that we have a right to apply the Catholic
test to the doctrine set forth by
<i>Janus</i>. For they, namely, the authors
(p. 14,) expressly profess to be in communion
with the Catholic Church,
though "inwardly separated by a
great gulf from those whose ideal of
the church is an universal empire."
The translator, too, presents <i>Janus</i> as
"a work of <i>Catholic authorship</i>," and
declares "<i>the authors members of a
school, morally if not numerically strong,
who yield to none in their loyal devotion
to Catholic truth</i>!"</p>

<p>In view of such declarations, we
may proceed to inquire, What is the
aim of <i>Janus</i>? The authors can best
answer this question; for, in their opinion,
since the forgery of the Isidorian
Decretals, about the year 845, the primacy
has been distorted and transformed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The papacy, such as it has become, presents
the appearance of a disfiguring, sickly,
and choking excrescence on the organization
of the church, hindering and decomposing
the action of its vital powers, and bringing
manifold diseases in its train."</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, <i>Janus</i> boldly asserts <i>Ã 
priori</i> that the approaching council
will not enjoy that freedom of deliberation
necessary to make it truly
&oelig;cumenical.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The recently proclaimed council is to be
held not only in Italy, but in Rome itself;
and already it has been announced that, as
the sixth Lateran Council, it will adhere
faithfully to the fifth. That is quite enough;
it means this: that whatever course the
synod may take, one quality can never be
predicated of it, namely, that it has been a
really free council." (Pp. 345, 346.)</p></blockquote>

<p>These extracts would be quite sufficient
to show the aim of <i>Janus</i>, and
his view of the "pope and the council."
How such harsh and preposterous
language may be reconciled with
<i>loyal devotion to Catholic truth</i>, and
that <i>commendable piety</i> which the authors
of <i>Janus</i> profess, we ask candid
and impartial readers to decide.</p>

<p><i>Janus</i> considers it to be true piety
"to expose the weak points of the
papacy, denounce its faults, and purposely
exhibit their mischievous results;"
appealing to a saying of St.
Bernard, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melius est ut scandalum oriatur,
quam ut veritas relinquatur</i>. It
is this intense love of truth which
prompts <i>Janus</i> "to oppose, frankly
and decisively, every disfigurement"
(p. 20) which the church has undergone
for nearly a thousand years.
"<i>To ward off so fatal a catastrophe</i>,"
with which the church is now threatened
by the council, the authors have
attempted in this work to contribute
to the awakening and direction of
public opinion, (p. 27,) and have entered
this "protest, based on history,"
and appeal to the "thinkers among
believing Christians," and are modest
enough to hope that their "labors
will attract attention in scientific circles,
and serve as a contribution to ecclesiastical
history." (Preface.)</p>

<p>We cannot, therefore, be surprised
that a work with such a <i>scientific</i> programme
should have caused some sensation,
even among Catholic theologians,
many of whom were not slow
to unmask the <i>historical representations</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
and "direct reference to original
authorities," of which <i>Janus</i> makes
such great parade. That <i>Janus</i> was
hailed with great delight, not only
abroad but also in this country, by an
anti-Catholic press, and nearly all reviews
or periodicals, cannot be a matter
of wonder, when we know that
such allies as <i>Janus</i> within our own
pale are welcome to the enemies of
the church.</p>

<p>In England, <i>Janus</i> was heralded by
a grand preliminary and concomitant
flourish of trumpets. Every thing was
done by a certain very small but very
zealous clique to give this book as
great a publicity as possible.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The
<cite>North British Review</cite>, the <cite>Saturday
Review</cite>, and the <cite>Academy</cite>, have joined
in one chorus of eulogy, exulting
over the victory which they think <i>Janus</i>
has achieved. Among the many
admirers of <i>Janus</i> in our country, suffice
it to say that one writer has been
so fascinated by this "<i>work, so entirely
made up of facts</i>," that he triumphantly
exclaims, "No one can help feeling
convinced of its veracity." Nay, more
than this, the same reviewer pays a
compliment to <i>Janus</i> which, considering
the source it comes from, involves
a strange contradiction. It runs thus,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The author (<i>Janus</i>) shows himself
throughout a <em>thorough</em> Catholic, but an <em>earnest</em>
and liberal Christian, a learned canonist,
a faithful and discriminating historian."</p></blockquote>

<p>Without further comments, we propose
to meet <i>Janus</i> and his admirers
upon equal grounds, since it is their
earnest wish</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"that the reader's attention should be exclusively
concentrated on the matter itself,
and that, in the event of its evoking controversy,
no opportunity should be given for
transferring the dispute from the sphere of
objective and scientific investigation of the
weighty questions under review." (P. 28.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We have no reason to dread <i>that
facts and "original authorities" must
and can speak for themselves</i>, and we
too shall hope to see where the saying
of Pope Innocent III. is verified,
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Falsitas sub velamine sanctitatis tolerari
non debet</i>."</p>

<p>In presence of such a vast amount
of matter as <i>Janus</i> gives to his readers,
and we might say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i>
with such little semblance of order
and system, it becomes necessary to
confine our examination to three leading
points: 1. To the manner in which
the investigation is conducted, or the
scientific character of the work; 2.
To the orthodoxy which the authors
profess; 3. To the historical and critical
parts of the book.</p>

<p>1. As is correctly stated in the
"Translator's Notice," the substance of
the volume already appeared in a series
of articles in the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Zeitung</i>,
or Gazette of Augsburg, in
March, 1869, under the heading of
"The Council and the <i>Civilta</i>." In
these articles, "historical facts" were
brought forward, which called forth
prompt and sharp answers from the
Catholic reviews of Germany, where
several falsehoods were exposed and
denounced as gross misrepresentations.
When these articles were issued
in their present form, the authors
of <i>Janus</i> took no notice of the exposure,
but quietly dropped from their
book these three mendacious statements.
Not a word of apology or
retractation was offered. An able
theologian<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> has pointed out these tactics
of <i>Janus</i>; but, to our knowledge,
no reply was given.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our <i>Janus</i>," says the same critic, "may
feel quite at ease; he will not be brought to
the stake either for his historical criticism,
or even for his heresies; but he has branded
himself as a forger by the very act of spiriting
away these lies, only to come forward
with a look of perfect innocence and palm
off upon the world others more numerous."</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, the new name of <i>Janus</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>assumed by the authors, has also a
figurative meaning, inasmuch as a different
face may be exhibited, just as
the case may demand. <i>Janus</i> declares
his love and attachment to the church
and the primacy, and regards it as a
<i>complete misapplication</i> of the term
<i>piety</i> "to conceal or color historical
facts and faulty institutions." (P. 20.)</p>

<p>Hence the inference will be legitimate
to stigmatize as impious a mode
of investigation which misstates and
distorts historical facts, shaking at the
very foundation both the church and
the primacy. And this is precisely
what <i>Janus</i> would accomplish, even
contrary to his own avowed intention.
For, according to him, "The primacy
rests on divine appointment;" and
still it has been transformed, and has
become destructive to the church,
rending asunder <i>that unity</i> which to
uphold and represent it had been instituted.
(Pp. 18, 21.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since the ninth century, a transformation
of the primacy, artificial and sickly, the
consequences of which have been the splitting
up of the previously united church into
three great ecclesiastical bodies, divided and
at enmity with each other."</p></blockquote>

<p>If such is the case, where, may we
ask, is that primacy of <i>divine institution</i>
to be found?&mdash;that primacy ever-living
and indefectible as the church
herself. And yet, we have the word
of <i>Janus</i> for it, the primacy, divinely
instituted as the centre of unity, has
virtually become extinct, and has failed
to be the source and centre of unity.
Did <i>Janus</i> himself dare to face
this inevitable and logical conclusion?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Roman bishops not only believed
themselves to be in possession of a divine
right, and acted accordingly, but this right
was actually recognized by others." (P. 22.)</p></blockquote>

<p>How is this profession to be reconciled
with the following one, "that
the form which this primacy took depended
on the concessions of the particular
local churches"?</p>

<p>What the privileges were which
Christ himself bestowed on the primacy,
<i>Janus nowhere</i> attempts to
state. Where, then, is his reason for
asserting that the form which the primacy
took depended on concessions?
Wherein consist the privileges inherent
in the primacy by divine right,
and which are those conceded by the
local churches? Until <i>Janus</i> has
distinctly defined these respective limits,
with what show of logic and
scientific process can he pronounce
that for eight centuries the primacy
was <i>legitimately developed</i>, and since
the ninth century so fatally transformed
and totally disfigured? Truly, if
he had committed himself to any <em>precise</em>
theory,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> he would have exposed
himself to an inglorious refutation; as
it is now, he has taken refuge in silence.
And yet, in justice to himself,
and in order to save his scientific reputation,
<i>Janus</i> was obliged to define
these divine rights of the primacy
before he could venture to say that
they had been <em>fatally</em> transformed;
thus he is able to bring forward "a
very dark side of the history of the
papacy." Superficial minds may be
ensnared by this deceitful procedure,
but fair and scientific thinkers will
rise indignantly and enter their solemn
protest against such an abuse of logic
and history. Moreover, it is obvious
that a primacy whose form, that is,
rights inherent to it, are made dependent
upon the consent of those over
whom it is to be exercised, is illusory,
and is a mere shadow. It is very
difficult to understand how such a
novel mode of reasoning should have
escaped our authors, who have "written
under a deep sense of anxiety,"
and we fear that, by pledging their
faith to such dogmas as the infallibility
of the church, and the divinely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>appointed primacy of St. Peter and
his successors, in the person of the
bishops of Rome, they have either
deluded themselves or hoped to delude
others by hollow professions of
faith and a hypocritical show of piety.</p>

<p>The authors, having thus left a wide
and open field in which to lead astray
and bewilder the minds of their readers,
do not hesitate to assert, "No
one acquainted with church history
will choose to affirm that the popes
ever exercised a fixed primatial right
in the same way" over the churches
in different countries. Quite a captious
and vague affirmation in each
and every particular. Are we to
understand that, because the same
primatial rights were not everywhere
and uniformly exercised, there
were no acknowledged rights of the
primacy? And yet to this conclusion,
however illogical, such a proposition
would lead. If the Roman bishops
have not at all times exercised
the same rights over the churches in
Egypt as over those of Africa or Gaul,
it is simply owing to the different condition
of the various churches, where
the exercise of such rights was not
necessary, and by the very nature of
things varied to meet the exigencies
of the churches. What opinion would
we form of a writer&mdash;we may be permitted
to use a familiar illustration&mdash;who,
from the fact that Congress did
not at one time enforce the same article
of our constitution in the State
of Ohio as it did in Virginia, concluded
that this legislative body possessed
not, or was not conscious of possessing,
the same rights and power granted
by the constitution in Ohio as in
Virginia? This is precisely what <i>Janus</i>
would induce his readers to believe
regarding the rights of the primacy.
That the popes throughout
the first centuries of the church exercised
primatial rights, <i>Janus</i> readily
grants, and must grant from the position
he assumes. Now, if the exercise
of such rights over the various churches
at different periods of the <i>ancient</i>
church, taken <i>collectively</i>, <i>involve all
those prerogatives</i> which the papacy
has since claimed and enjoyed, we
must of necessity infer that the rights
of the primacy, as understood and exercised
at the present period, are identical
with those of the first eight centuries.</p>

<p>This we could prove by a "work
entirely made up of facts, and supporting
all statements by reference to
the original authorities." Yes, this
has already been done by able and
judicious historians; among the more
modern ones we may appropriately
challenge a careful perusal of the
history of Dr. DÃ¶llinger,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> in which a
complete enumeration of the prerogatives
exercised by the bishops of Rome
over the whole church, both in the
east and in the west, may be found,
together with a direct reference to
many and unexceptionable historical
facts. Under the present head we
merely refer to the action of Pope St.
Victor, in the second century, against
the churches of Asia Minor concerning
the question of paschal celebration
against the Quartodecimans; St.
Stephen, against the Anabaptists in
Africa; St. Cornelius, against Novatus
and Felicissimus; St. Dionysius, in the
case of Paul of Samosata, Bishop of
Antioch, when the Emperor Aurelian
himself would not sustain him, and
referred to the Bishop of Rome for a
final decision; all these statements attested
by such writers as Eusebius,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Socrates,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
and Theodoret.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> How
about the appeal of the Montanists to
the Bishop of Rome, mentioned by
Tertullian<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> himself? Did not Marcion
repair to Rome to obtain a reversal
of the sentence passed against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
him?<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Did not that illustrious champion
of faith, St. Athanasius of Alexandria,
appeal to Pope Julius I. against
the Arians, when the Council of Sardica
was convoked at the request of
the pope in the year 343, and the
supremacy of the Roman bishop
solemnly acknowledged, to whom all
must appeal for final sentence?<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><i>Janus</i>, however, with this most conspicuous
incident of history before
him, says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is no mention of papal rights, or
any reference to a legally defined action of
the Bishop of Rome in other churches, with
the single exception of the canon of Sardica,
which never obtained universally even in the
west." (P. 23.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Having produced one most remarkable
instance of the application
of this canon of Sardica, we now must
inform our readers that this same <i>canon</i>
of the Synod of Sardica was inserted
in a Latin version of a collection
of canons known by the name
of "Prisca Collectio,"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> as early as the
fifth century, and regarded as a code
of laws attesting the tradition of the
<i>ancient</i> church, according to the maxim
of St. Vincent of Lerins, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod
semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus
creditum est</i>. In like manner did St.
John Chrysostom, that great doctor
of the eastern church, appeal to Pope
Innocent I., although his adversary,
the usurper Theophilus, had sent delegates
to Rome to gain the pontiff,
who annulled all the acts of Theophilus
and his party against the illustrious
patriarch. The letter which St.
Chrysostom<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> wrote to the pope adds
great strength to our argument. St.
Cyprian, too, by whose authority our
adversaries would fain triumph, sent
the acts of synods held by himself to
the Bishop of Rome for confirmation,
and also asked St. Stephen to <i>depose</i>
Marcion, Bishop of Arles, as being a
partisan of Novatian, and to appoint
another in his place. But we must
ask pardon of the reader for having
already been too long in these references&mdash;though
as yet we have said
nothing of the many acts and letters
of Pope St. Leo the Great&mdash;all of
which demonstrate beyond the shadow
of doubt that the most ample
exercise of <i>all primatial</i> prerogatives
was made in nearly all the churches
of the Christian world. A rapid
glance over the discourses and letters
of the distinguished pontiff, in the
voluminous work of Ballerini, will
corroborate our assertion in its whole
extent. What are we to think of
these words of <i>Janus</i>, "No one acquainted
with church history will
choose to affirm that the popes ever
exercised a fixed primatial right"?
To us, it would seem nothing less
than an appeal to the ignorance of
his readers. A similar proceeding we
notice in the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The well-known fact speaks clearly
enough for itself, that throughout the whole
ancient canon law, whether in the collections
preserved in the eastern or the western
church, there is no mention made of papal
rights."</p></blockquote>

<p>We do not attribute such a confused
and inaccurate knowledge to
<i>Janus</i>, that he is not fully aware what
all these collections comprise. These
collections or codes of law are pretty
numerous,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> both in the Greek and in
the Latin churches, and some of them
contain besides the "Canones Apostolorum,"
not only many decrees of the
councils, both particular and &oelig;cumenical,
that were held during the third,
fourth, and fifth centuries, but also
the decretals of the early popes. Thus,
for instance, the collection made by
the monk Dionysius<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> comprises, in a
chronological order, the decretals or
decrees of all the popes from St. Siricius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>in the year 395, to St. Anastasius
II. in 486. Another Spanish
collection of canons, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber
Canonum</i>, is very comprehensive,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
embracing the decrees of all the synods
that were held in the eastern
and western churches, together with
the decretal letters of twenty popes
from St. Damasus to Gregory the
Great. A similar collection of canons
in Africa was approved by the Synod
of Carthage in 419. Now, according
to our authors, in <i>all these
collections</i> "no mention is made of
papal rights, or any reference to a legally
defined action of the Bishop of
Rome in other churches." Truly!
we need but challenge an examination
of many decrees of synods, and
of the official letters of the popes contained
in these collections, and we
shall find all primatial rights fully exercised
and universally acknowledged.
Who does not know the splendid
testimonies of the fathers in the councils
of Ephesus and Chalcedon, both
of which acknowledged in their acts
the supremacy of the see of Rome!
As to the many decretal letters of the
popes, there are no more celebrated
documents in early history than the
professions of faith given by Pope
Celestine I. to the bishops of Gaul
against Semipelagianism,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> St. Boniface
to the bishops of Illyria, St. Gelasius
in a decree on <i>canonical</i> Scripture and
the well-known formula of Pope St.
Hormisdas,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> subscribed to by the eastern
bishops. By far the greater number
of these pontifical letters constituting
those <i>collections</i> imply one or another
prerogative exercised by the bishops
of Rome, who were ever conscious,
even in <i>those early ages</i>, of being the
supreme teachers and guardians of
faith appointed by Christ himself.
With what mien of self-sufficiency and
confidence <i>Janus</i> can style a "well-known
fact," something of which just
the very opposite results from an inspection
of historical records, is more
than unintelligible in authors who
make such ado about their scientific
fairness. With a desire to save <i>Janus's</i>
reputation as a <i>learned canonist</i>
and <i>faithful historian</i>, we must presume
such a grave misstatement wilful,
and naturally enough he must
have reckoned on readers who have
little or no knowledge of the "ancient
collections of the canons." Yet
we must not fail to enter an energetic
protest against these self-proclaimed
"scientific labors and contributions
to ecclesiastical history." Is it by
such unblushing assertions, without
proof to sustain them, that the authors
show their "love and honor for an
institution" which forms an essential
part of the constitution of the church?</p>

<p>The whole introduction of this work,
covering nearly thirty pages, exhibits
a programme with summary indications,
whence <i>Janus</i> infers that with
the present council the system of absolutism
is to be crowned, and the
church to come within the grasp of
a "powerful coalition." This great
danger to the church the anonymous
authors feel in duty bound to avert,
and to oppose this "advancing flood-tide,"
in which we may discover another
characteristic mode of warfare,
since <i>Janus</i> deems it necessary to "assail
a powerful party, with clearly ascertained
objects, which has gained
a firm footing through the wide ramifications
of the Jesuit order." And
this party he can only attack by
"bringing forward a very dark side
of the history of the papacy." Indeed,
a singular mode of warfare, but
one which presents no feature of novelty.
Have not the Reformers of
the sixteenth century, like most of
their forerunners, concealed their true
aim by attacking ostensibly the Curia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
or some religious body, as Luther did
the Dominicans, and in the seventeenth
century did not the Jansenists resort
to a similar stratagem? Now, with
such a clear profession before us, why
these assaults on the hierarchy and
the church in general for the last
thousand years? Why make the whole
church accountable for the misdeeds
and <i>menacing coalition</i> of a party?
Why, as <i>faithful Catholics</i>, appeal, not
to the council nor to the hierarchy, but
"to the thinkers among believing Christians"?
<i>Reformers</i> before <i>Janus</i> usually
appealed from the popes to general
councils, but he surpasses them all by
appealing neither to the one nor to the
other, but to the laity, who may even
pronounce on the "reception or rejection
of the council or its decisions."
Assuredly no further arguments need
be brought forward to satisfy candid
and discriminating minds that <i>Janus</i>
has ill succeeded in masking his true
purpose; nor can his professions of
loving truth and justice stand the test
of criticism, or the dignity of scientific
investigation tolerate the insolent
treatment it has suffered at the hands
of <i>Janus</i> and his school. For those
among our readers who must be
shocked at seeing names of men distinguished
for their learning and piety
at a very critical period in Germany,
quoted in support of the opinions
of this school of traitors, (pp.
16, 17,) we can say that <i>Janus</i>, by
attributing to such men a similarity
of views with himself, makes a gratuitous
and bold assertion, corroborated
by no reliable authority; only one
name, that of the eccentric Baader,
lends any probability to this impudent
statement. But such names as Walter,
Philipps, Hefele, Hagemann,
GfrÃ¶rer, and even DÃ¶llinger up to a
certain time, renowned for their profound
researches and contributions
to ecclesiastical history and jurisprudence,
are studiously omitted by <i>Janus</i>;
nor would it have served his purpose,
since the eminent theologians
just mentioned have undermined and
exploded whatever scientific or historical
basis Febronianism and Gallicanism
could boast of, and which <i>Janus</i>
would reÃ«stablish. In summing up
our considerations on this point, we
fully concur in the remarks of an able
writer, that <i>Janus</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"does his utmost to overthrow what is at
present by far man's strongest barrier against
the rapid and violent inflowing atheistic tide,
without attempting to substitute another in
its place. If his book could exercise any
real power, that power would be put forth
in favor of those whom the author agrees
with us in regarding as the most dangerous
enemies of every highest human interest."</p></blockquote>

<p>This serious apprehension has been
fully verified by the many admirers
<i>Janus</i> has found in the hostile camp;
nay, the apostate Froschhamer has
even complimented <i>Janus</i> publicly,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
with only one restriction, namely, that
he has only gone half-way, and finds
fault with this inconsistency.</p>

<p>2. We did not propose to content
ourselves with the gratuitous assertion
that <i>Janus</i> is not "throughout a
thorough Catholic and earnest Christian;"
but we shall make it clear that
he has already seceded from well-established
points of doctrine, and even
rendered his scheme of reforming the
church an impossible hypothesis. As
we have already stated, <i>Janus</i> directs
his attacks against a "party"&mdash;ultramontanism&mdash;which,
he says, is "essentially
papalism." (P. 34.) But while
professing to oppose an "ultramontane
scheme," he finally arrives, by a
very promiscuous array of <i>historical
facts</i> and <i>scientific investigations</i>, at the
conclusion that the entire church, led
by the popes during the last thousand
years, has been dragged into this
gross error and devastating <i>torrent</i> of
ultramontanism. By means of a <i>huge forgery</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>the "whole constitution and
government of the church has been
changed"&mdash;that is, has become a human
institution, and lost its divine
character. What, then, is the result
the writers of <i>Janus</i> arrive at as to
their own position? "Inwardly a
great gulf separates" them from such
a church and its chief pastor&mdash;that is,
from Pius IX. and the episcopacy.
For in another place (p. 3) he affirms
that the doctrines he attacks are "identical
with those of the chief head."
Does it not follow from these premises
that <i>Janus</i> excludes himself from this
"centre of unity," as the see of Rome
has been called by St. Cyprian, Bishop
of Carthage? Likewise St. Jerome,
in his book against Rufinus, asks the
latter, "Is your faith the faith of the
Church of Rome? If so," he adds,
"we are both Catholics." During
the pontificate of St. Hormisdas, from
the year 514 to 523, two hundred and
fifty bishops signed a formulary sent
them by the pope, in which they declared
that they who were not in all
things in union with the apostolic see
were cut off from communion with
the Catholic Church.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>By what right, then, or by what interpretation,
we demand, can <i>Janus</i>
be called a "thorough Catholic"?</p>

<p>The unity and indefectibility of the
church of Christ are essential doctrines,
most clearly and distinctly embodied
in the sacred Scriptures. But
<i>Janus</i> no longer admits them, as the
following passages will show:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The previously united church has been
split up into three great ecclesiastical bodies,
divided and at enmity with each other....
When the presidency in the church became
an empire, ... then the <i>unity</i> of <i>the church</i>,
so firmly secured before, was <i>broken</i> up."
(P. 21.)</p></blockquote>

<p>According to <i>Janus</i>, a "great and
searching reformation of the church
is necessary;" and, let it be understood,
not in matters of discipline,
which can vary, but in matters of
faith&mdash;yes! in the most important
points touching the divine constitution
of the church.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The popes possessed none of the three
powers which are the proper attributes of
sovereignty; neither the legislative, the administrative,
nor the judicial."</p>

<p>"For a long time nothing was known in
Rome of definite rights bequeathed by Peter
to his successors."</p>

<p>"The bishops of Rome could neither exclude
individuals nor churches from the
church universal." (Pp. 64, 66.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Confront these assertions with the
few but remarkable facts already given
from history, and what becomes
of them?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There are many national churches which
were never under Rome, and never even had
any intercourse with Rome." (P. 68.)</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Janus</i> then proceeds to give examples
of such autonomous churches,
and we confess that it has seldom
been our lot to see any thing more
vague and evasive.</p>

<p>In the first place, we refer to the letter
of the Syrian bishops, which was
read in the fifth session of the synod
held in Constantinople in the year
536, by the Patriarch Mennas; moreover,
the profession which the Archimandrites
and other Syrian monks
sent to Pope Hormisdas, in which
they plainly acknowledge and invoke
the Bishop of Rome as supreme guardian
of the entire flock of Christ.</p>

<p>If the churches in Persia, in Armenia,
and in Abyssinia, before they
were commingled and entangled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the different Gnostic sects and Monophysites,
or Jacobites, were in union
with the churches of Alexandria, of
Antioch, and Constantinople, who, in
their turn, recognized the supremacy
of the see of Rome, in what possible
sense can they be called <i>autonomous</i>?
Frumentius had been ordained Bishop
of Axuma, in Abyssinia, by St. Athanasius,
Archbishop of Alexandria, toward
the year 326.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Will <i>Janus</i> claim
St. Athanasius as his partisan respecting
this autonomy? His attempt to
claim the same autonomy for the early
Irish and British churches is no
less hazardous, and we refer to Dr.
DÃ¶llinger's history<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> for a refutation
of such claims. In this connection,
however, it was only our purpose to
prove from <i>Janus's</i> own admission
that the "unity of the church was broken
up." Quite natural, too, since
the "centre of unity" no longer preserved
its divine mission and character!</p>

<p>We hasten to another grave charge
against the orthodoxy of <i>Janus</i>,
namely, that he denies the primacy
both in its divine institution and in
its rights. The true primacy he reviles
as "papalism," and would substitute
a mere primacy of honor or
"presidency." For it was only during
a few centuries that the primacy
had a <i>sound</i> and <i>natural</i> development;
since then it has become disfigured
by human "fabrications," and
consequently exists no longer. Such
being the case, we are unable to discover
even a supremacy of honor,
lawfully exercised by the pope. We
solicit a careful examination of the
primacy as it appears in the <cite>Ancient
Constitution of the Church</cite>, and in the
<cite>Teachings of the Fathers</cite>, (pp. 63-75,)
and the inevitable conclusion derived
from those assumptions, sounding
like oracles of Delphi, will be this,
the plenitude of power assumed and
exercised by the Bishop of Rome over
the whole church has no foundation
whatsoever, neither in the Scriptures,
as interpreted by the fathers, nor in
ancient tradition, but has been and
still is an encroachment on the privileges
of the particular churches, a
usurpation exercised by force and oppression&mdash;in
fine, an innovation on the
divine constitution given to the church
by Christ. Every thing that is advanced
by <i>Janus</i> purporting to trace
historically the origin and causes of
papal power and its "unnatural development,"
even with that illustrious
pontiff St. Leo the Great, (p. 67,) taking
up nearly two thirds of the volume,
proves, if any thing, that no
special prerogative was given to St.
Peter by Christ, and hence could not,
of course, be "hereditary in the line
of Roman bishops." (P. 74.) The
great <i>nightmare</i> of <i>Janus</i> is, indeed,
the pope's infallibility, or the supremacy
of the Roman see in doctrinal decisions;
but while assaulting the former
in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pÃªle-mÃªle</i> warfare, he utterly destroys
the primacy itself; though it
would seem that infallibility properly
understood is but a corollary of the
primacy itself. While professing to
reject the doctrine of the "papacy,"
<i>Janus</i> discards a truly apostolic doctrine
of the Catholic Church, and we
cannot but suspect him of well-calculated
dissimulation when he says that
the "authors of the book profess their
adherence to the conviction that the
primacy rests on divine appointment."
Contrast this with the statements quoted,
and we can hardly refrain from
sentiments of abhorrence and indignation
at such duplicity, as, on the one
hand, we find it stated that "the ancient
church found the need of a bishop
possessed of primatial authority,"
and, on the other hand, "nothing was
known of definite rights," and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
"same powers were exercised by the
bishop of Antioch, Jerusalem, or Alexandria."</p>

<p>The orthodoxy of <i>Janus</i> and his
abettors is impeachable in another no
less serious point. The church has
ever been conscious of her own infallibility,
whereby she is protected from
all error in teaching "all truth to the
nations;" in other words, it has ever
been firmly believed among Catholics
that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ecclesia docens</i>, or teaching
church, succeeded to the divinely bestowed
privilege of apostolic infallibility,
and, whether congregated in
council or dispersed throughout the
world, is a true exponent of "unity
in faith and grace" with her divine
Founder. If this were not so, in what
possible sense could the church be
called "a pillar and ground of truth"?
Where would the assistance and guidance
of the Holy Spirit have any visible
action or influence, if it be not
to preserve her "immaculate, holy,
and pure"? Hence, those beautiful
images employed by the Apostle St.
Paul, of the "union of the body with
the head," of this truly <i>spiritual alliance
of Christ with his spouse</i>, that is,
the church, through whose ministry
the life of Christ descends from the
head to the members, Christ's life being
nothing else but truth and grace.</p>

<p>But if we adopt <i>Janus's</i> idea of
the church, she has become as the
"harlot of Babylon," a depositary of
falsehood and iniquity. For he denies
the unerring authority of &oelig;cumenical
councils under the conditions
in which it has always been received
as a dogma by Catholic theologians.
The oath of the bishops toward the
apostolic see, prescribed for many past
centuries, is pronounced by <i>Janus</i> as
incompatible with "that freedom of
deliberation and voting" which are
essential to such an assembly. But,
we may ask, does this oath interfere in
the least with the strict obligation of
keeping the faith intact and inviolable?
Does this oath imply any violation
of Catholic conscience? You
might as well assert that the oath
taken by a member of Congress, or of
a particular legislature, to support and
abide by the constitution, interferes
with his liberty of speaking and voting.
In keeping with this hypothesis
of <i>Janus</i>, all the councils that were
held in the west, and universally acknowledged
as &oelig;cumenical, "were
perverted, and mere tools of papal
domination&mdash;shadows of the councils
of the ancient church." (P. 154.) But
the councils held in the east were truly
&oelig;cumenical, because the popes had
<i>nothing</i> to do with them, (pp. 63, 64;)
but the emperors, on the contrary, exercised
all those prerogatives which
the popes afterward usurped; hence
the councils in the west were but a
"sham and mockery" when compared
to the <i>genuine</i> &oelig;cumenical councils
held by the emperors, "who sometimes
trenched too closely on this
freedom." (P. 354.) Yet the weight
of imperial power and domination
does not do away with that essential
condition of an &oelig;cumenical council.
But with the popes the case is quite
the reverse! Truly admirable logic
of our <i>Janus</i>! He is not content
with unprincipled expositions and illogical
hypotheses, but resorts to positive
<i>falsification</i> of history when he
says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Neither the dogmatic nor the disciplinary
decisions of these councils (held in the
east) required papal confirmation; for their
force and authority depended on the consent
of the church, as expressed in the synod,
and afterward in the fact of its being generally
received."</p></blockquote>

<p>And again,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The popes took no part in convoking
councils. All great councils were convoked
by the emperors; nor were the popes ever
consulted about it beforehand." (Pp. 63,
64.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>What is the verdict of history on
these points? That very <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latrocinium</i>
of Ephesus, in 449, which <i>Janus</i> so
adroitly would put among those councils
that were regarded as &oelig;cumenical,
called forth a protest not only
from Pope Leo the Great, but also
from the eastern bishops, because the
ambitious Dioscorus assumed to himself
the right of presiding, and, as
Prosper and Victor remark in their
chronicles, "usurped the prerogative
of the supremacy." The most ancient
historians, Socrates, Sozomenus,
and Theodoret, who continued the
church history of Eusebius, attest
unanimously those prerogatives of
the Roman bishop, which our authors
would so boldly deny. Thus, Sozomenus,
in the third book of his history,
chapter 10, says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is a pontifical law (<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Î½á½Î¼Î¿Ï ÎÎµÏÎ±ÏÎ¹Îºá½Ï</span>)
that whatever has been done without the
judgment of the Roman bishop, be null and
void."</p></blockquote>

<p>Socrates, alluding to the Arian Synod
of Antioch in "EncÃ¦niis," in
431, by the adherents of Eusebius,
Patriarch of Constantinople, and which
pronounced the deposition of St. Athanasius,
observes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Neither Julius, the Bishop of Rome, was
present, nor did he send any one thither to
take his place; though it is prohibited by
ecclesiastical law that any thing be decreed
in the church without the consent of the
Roman pontiff."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When, therefore, St. Athanasius, together
with Paul of Constantinople,
Marcellus of Ancyra, and Asclepas
of Gaza, sought the protection of
Pope Julius, the latter had their cause
examined in a council held at Rome
in 343, at which a great number of
eastern bishops were present. Whereupon
the pope declared the accused
bishops innocent, restored them to
their sees, and severely censured those
who had concurred in the sentence
of deposition against Athanasius and
the other bishops. Let it be understood
that the Arian bishops, too, on
their part, had appealed to the same
pope. The action taken by the Pontiff
Julius in this grave affair is designated
by the historian Socrates<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> as a
"prerogative of the Roman Church."
In like manner, Pelagius appealed to
Pope Innocent I.; Nestorius, to Pope
Celestine, to whom St. Cyril of Alexandria
had already reported.</p>

<p>CÃ¦lestius, a disciple of Pelagius,
already condemned by the Synod of
Carthage, invoked the arbitration of
Pope Zosimus;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Eutyches, having
been excluded from the communion
of the church by Flavian, Patriarch
of Constantinople, appeals to Pope
St. Leo, who in his turn calls upon
Flavian to give an account, which the
latter does without delay. The correspondence
between Leo and Flavian
on this point shows the falsehood
of <i>Janus's</i> assertion, that the "fathers
had given the see of Rome the privilege
of final decision in appeals,"
(p. 66,) and that the "bishops of
Rome could exclude neither individuals
nor churches from the communion
of the church universal." Who does
not know the remarkable words of St.
Augustine, when Pelagius had been
condemned by the synods of Milevis
and Carthage in 416, and still persisted
to hold communion with the
church? Pope Innocent ratified the
decrees of the synods, and the illustrious
champion against Pelagianism exclaims,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Two councils have already been sent to
the apostolic see; thence answer has been
received; the case is terminated; may the
error too be ended."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Vain, too, is the attempt of our
authors to give dark colors to the
transactions between the fathers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>the Council of Chalcedon and Pope
St. Leo I. (P. 67.) Let us see what
the fathers of this council say to the
pope, when they request him to sanction
that <i>famous</i> twenty-eighth canon,
which the legates of Leo had refused
to sanction. They say, "Knowing
that your holiness hearing (what has
been decreed) will approve and confirm
this synod and close their petition
thus,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We therefore pray that by thy decrees
thou wilt honor our judgment, and we having
in all things meet manifested our accordance
with the head, so also may thy highness
fulfil what is just. (<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Î¿ÏÏÏ ÎºÎ±á½¶ á¼£ ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÏá¼£
ÏÎ¿Î¹Ï ÏÎ±Î¹Ïá½¶Î½ á¼Î½Î±ÏÎ»Î·Ïá½¡ÏÎ±Î¹ Ïá½¸ ÏÏá¼ÏÎ¿Î½</span>.)"<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Leo I. did not sanction this twenty-eighth
canon, for the very reason
that it implied, though in equivocal
terms, that Rome obtained the primacy
on account of its political dignity.</p>

<p>Nor is it true that the fathers by
this canon claimed "equal rights" for
the see of Constantinople; but merely
<i>patriarchal</i> rights and exemption
from subordination to Alexandria and
Antioch, as the sixth Nicene canon
had ordained. Pope Leo I. in his
letter<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> to the Emperor Marcian affirmed
that Constantinople was indeed
an "imperial," but no "apostolic
city." Compare this with the words
of <i>Janus</i>, "But when Leo had to
deal with Byzantium and the east, he
no longer dared to plead this argument."
Anatolius, Patriarch of Constantinople
at that period, previous
to the Council of Chalcedon was
obliged to hold a synod in the presence
of the papal legates, in which
Leo's letter to Flavian was read and
signed, and Eutyches sentenced and
deposed. Even at the Council of
Ephesus, in 431, St. Cyril presided as
plenipotentiary of Pope Celestine, who,
upon a report sent him by St. Cyril,
had condemned the Nestorian errors
in a synod held at Rome in 430, and
summoned Nestorius to retract within
ten days under pain of excommunication.
How trivial, then, and calculated
to confuse the reader, must
this remark of <i>Janus</i> seem, "At the
two councils of Ephesus others presided."
It is a well-known fact that
the papal legates at the Council of
Chalcedon declared that it was a high
misdemeanor of the second assembly
of Ephesus, in 449, and a crime in
Dioscorus of Alexandria, that it was
presumed to hold a general council
without the authority of the apostolic
see; and Dioscorus was accordingly
deposed.</p>

<p>The Council of Chalcedon was not
convoked before Pulcheria and Marcian
had requested and obtained the
consent of Pope Leo I., and at its
termination the fathers said in their
letter to the pope that he had presided
over them by his legates as the
"head over the members;" and that
the emperor had been present for the
maintenance of decorum.</p>

<p>Why, then, allege such examples as
the despotic actions of Constantius,
against whom such great and distinguished
bishops as St. Athanasius, St.
Hilary of Poitiers, and Lucifer, raised
their pastoral voice, when this same
emperor so harassed the bishops
at Rimini and Seleucia in 359, aided
by the cunning of Ursacius and Valens,
that they subscribed to an ambiguous
but not heretical formulary.
Wherefore, St. Jerome exclaims, "Ingemuit
totus orbis et Arianum se esse
miratus est." The purpose of <i>Janus</i>
in placing these assemblies among
other councils universally regarded as
&oelig;cumenical, appears, to say the least,
suspicious! (P. 354, and Translator's
Notice.)</p>

<p>We might yet quote many examples
to exhibit what must be styled
<i>gross misrepresentation</i> and <i>falsification</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
of history on the part of <i>Janus</i>,
when he thus plainly states that the
popes were never <i>consulted</i> when councils
were convoked, nor <i>allowed</i> to
preside, <i>personally</i> or by <i>deputy</i>&mdash;and
"it is clear that the popes did not
claim this as their exclusive right,"
(p. 63.) If any thing were wanting
to corroborate our argument, we need
but allude to the declaration of the
Patriarch Mennas of Constantinople,
and many other eastern bishops.
When the Emperor Justinian would
continue the council which was convoked
with the express consent of
Pope Vigilius, who withdrew his permission
after the emperor issued an
edict on the <i>three articles, (tria capitula,)</i>
the pope fled to Chalcedon,
whence he directed a letter to the
whole church,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> giving an account of
the deplorable state of things, adding
that he had deposed the haughty
bishop, Theodorus of CÃ¦sarea, and suspended
Mennas of Constantinople,
with the bishops who took his part.
The declaration made by Mennas and
other bishops, professing their entire
submission, affords a most striking example
of the supreme authority of
the apostolic see in the midst of such
turmoil and religious disputes, the
pope being an exile and the bishops
enjoying the protection of the emperor;
and hence not a vestige of coercion
in their unqualified declaration,
which we may be pardoned for subjoining
here. It is as follows,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Following the apostolic doctrine, and
anxious to maintain ecclesiastical unity, we
are about to frame the present declaration,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
We receive and acknowledge the four holy
synods, ... and all other things that
were decreed and written in these same synods
by common consent with the legates
and representatives of the apostolic see, not
only in matters of faith, but every thing
that was so defined and enacted in all other
causes, judgments, constitutions, and ordinances
we promise hereby faithfully and
inviolably to observe."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A circumstance which gives greater
weight to this whole exposition is,
that these councils were chiefly attended
by eastern bishops, among
them the patriarchs of Constantinople;
and that the Roman pontiffs,
though not personally present, still
by their representatives, who were not
all bishops, exercised such high prerogatives.
The emperors themselves
recognized these rights of the see of
Rome both by their laws and public
acts.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>We have been rather prolix, and
have carried our examination further
than we intended; but it seemed necessary
to sustain our charges against
<i>Janus</i> and his admirers by various
and most unexceptionable authorities
from history, and the canons of the
early councils. The supremacy of
the Bishop of Rome in <i>teaching</i> and
<i>governing</i> the universal church, could
not be exhibited in a more resplendent
light than in connection with
general councils, those grand assemblies
of the hierarchy of the church.
Nothing, therefore, was better calculated
than the futile essays of the
anonymous authors of <i>Janus</i> to depreciate
and obliterate, if possible, these
prerogatives of the Roman pontiffs
in connection with &oelig;cumenical councils,
in order to lay the foundation of
their hypothesis, that since the ninth
century papal usurpation and ambition
held high sway in the church,
"hindering and decomposing the action
of its vital powers." How far
<i>Janus</i> has succeeded in finding such
a <i>basis</i> for <i>his edifice</i> in history and in
ancient canonical collections, how far
his statements are supported by "<i>reference</i>
to <i>original authorities</i>," the
candid and judicious reader of church
history will have been able to decide.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>If <i>Janus</i> asks the verdict of history
for <i>his</i> "Ancient Constitution of the
Church," that verdict cries aloud
against such a miserable caricature,
and his appeal to past tradition is an
appeal to ignorance or wilful prejudice.
We have impeached his orthodoxy
on points of the very first importance,
and in vain do we look for
those "original authorities" which
should verify his hypothesis of the
"ancient church."</p>

<p>Before summing up our arguments
on this head, we will be allowed to
point out another serious and most
pernicious error of <i>Janus</i>. He says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The force and authority of the decisions
of councils depended on the consent of the
church, and on the fact of being generally received."
(Pp. 63, 64.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet we must examine what is meant
by this consent of the church; here is
his theory:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When a council passes sentence on doctrine,
it thereby gives testimony to its truth.
The bishops attest, each for his own portion
of the church, that a certain defined doctrine
has hitherto been taught and believed there;
or they bear witness that the doctrines hitherto
believed, involve, as their necessary consequence,
some truth which may not yet
have been expressly formalized. As to
whether this testimony has been rightly given,
whether freedom and unbiassed truthfulness
have prevailed among the assembled
bishops&mdash;on that point the church herself
is the ultimate judge, by her <i>acceptance</i> or
<i>rejection</i> of the council or its decisions." (P.
334.)</p></blockquote>

<p>What a precious theory indeed of
our authors! The teaching body in
the church, or the hierarchy, are <i>mere</i>
witnesses in giving testimony to the
truth. But this testimony may ultimately
be rejected; for whether such
a testimony has been rightly rendered
or not, is left to the decision of the
church&mdash;consisting of the clergy and
<i>laity</i>. Whence by a rigid conclusion
it follows that the <i>highest tribunal</i> of
"acceptance or rejection" of the decisions
of a general council, is with the
great mass of the faithful or "thinkers
among believing Christians." In
view of such plain propositions, we
should like to be informed how inerrancy
or infallibility can be attributed
to an &oelig;cumenical council? We may
then select any council and doubt, as
<i>thinking Christians</i>, "whether freedom
and unbiassed truthfulness have prevailed
among the assembled bishops."
All certainty is excluded by such a
theory, where the decisions of a general
council are only binding when
accepted by the church outside of the
council. This is nothing less than a
complete negation of traditional and
sound Catholic doctrine&mdash;it is simply
proclaiming the broad Protestant dogma
which grants the widest scope to
the private judgment of the individual.
In one direction have the
authors of <i>Janus</i> been consistent;
for they purpose by their labors "to
contribute to the awakening and direction
of public opinion," which is
the tribunal charged by <i>Janus</i> to reject
in advance the decrees of this
council. (P. 345.) He himself makes
an extensive use of this great privilege;
for, according to him, since
the ninth century there were no truly
&oelig;cumenical councils; the whole
church has been forced and cajoled
into giving a wrong testimony. All
councils since the period just named
have proclaimed the views and tenets
of a party as the constant belief of
all Catholic Christendom. Such an
issue <i>Janus</i> would fain declare impossible.
Alas! for his beautiful theory,
destroying with one hand what he

<p>"The church in its totality is secured
against false doctrine."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is precisely the dilemma in
which <i>Janus</i> has involved himself.
The whole work from beginning to
end is intended to show that the
church has sunk into a labyrinth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
errors, that she has radically changed
her ancient and divine constitution,
that her centre of unity has become
disfigured and sickly, that her vital
powers are in a state of decomposition.
Does all this not imply false
doctrine? Has the church not thereby
fallen away from Christ and the apostles?
Perhaps <i>Janus</i> will say that it is
only the <i>hierarchy</i> that <i>erred</i>, not the
"thinkers among believing Christians,"
himself, of course, among the
latter.</p>

<p>Well may we inquire of <i>Janus</i> and
his <i>admirers</i>, What has become of the
promises made to the church by her
divine Founder? Where is that spirit
of truth to guide her through her
pastors, the bishops united with the
supreme Head? Where is that firm
rock against which the gates of hell
shall not prevail?</p>

<p>These questions are so intimately
connected with the whole divinely
reared edifice of the church of Christ,
that to deny what the authors of
<i>Janus</i> have done is heresy in its worst
form, as much as Arianism, Pelagianism,
or Nestorianism. We cannot
withhold from our readers the appreciation
of a candid and thoughtful
outsider on the position <i>Janus</i> has
followed throughout his work:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the liberal Catholicism of <i>Janus</i> and
his friends is an infallible system, it is an
infallible system which has succumbed at
once to a false pretence of infallibility on one
side and an openly-admitted fallibility on
the other. Now, infallibility which is beaten
for centuries, <i>both</i> by a sham infallibility
<i>and</i> by admitted incapacity for true infallibility,
is infallibility of a very novel kind, very
difficult to imagine. It looks, at first glance,
very like a rather specially fallible kind of
fallibility with a taste for calling itself grand
names. If <i>Janus</i> and his friends are right,
no paradox of the Christian faith is half as
great as theirs, which maintains that the true
infallibility of the church has not only lain
<i>perdu</i> for centuries, but has been impersonated
by a growth of falsehood without any interposition
on the part of the divine source
of infallibility. That, we confess&mdash;with all
our respect for the wish of <i>Janus</i> to enter a
protest on behalf of liberty and civilization&mdash;we
do find a hypothesis somewhat hard
even to listen to. A dumb infallibility that
cannot find its voice for centuries, even to
contradict the potent and ostentatious error
that takes its name in vain&mdash;is that the sort of
divine authority to which human reason will
willingly go into captivity? But we might
sympathize with the authors of <i>Janus</i>, in
spite of their utterly untenable intellectual
position, if they seemed to us to have any
clear advantage in moral earnestness and
simplicity over their opponents. But, while
there is a certain school of ultramontanes
that simply and profoundly believes in the
infallibility of the pope, in spite of all the
critical and historical difficulties which the
liberals ably parade and sometimes even
overstate, we find it hard to believe that the
latter believe cordially in any church infallibility
at all." (Quoted by the <cite>Dublin Review</cite>,
January, from the <cite>Spectator</cite>, November
6, 1869.)</p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 center">TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF THE REVUE DU MONDE CATHOLIQUE.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE WOODEN SHOE.</h2>


<p>Jacques was a fisherman&mdash;a lucky one
too. He had a little house, all
his own, and, in it Jeanne who had
been for seven years his wife, and
Ange, the jolliest little scamp that ever
romped about a fisherman's cottage.
But these are not all his treasures.
He has, besides, a store of nets and
a boat called the Fine-Anguille. The
sea was never yet too rough for either.
For it never stormed until the Fine-Anguille
had come with her crew,
snug and dry, to her mooring. The
captain of this frigate was Jacques; the
mate&mdash;and what a mate he was!&mdash;was
Fanor, a Newfoundland, peer and
prince of all dogs. Every body knew
the Fine-Anguille. Every body knew
Fanor. And well it was for many of
them that they did. They had made
his acquaintance under memorable circumstances.
For, when Fanor looked
from his kennel at night along the
dark coast, he could see the glow of
many a fireside which would have
long been dark and cheerless if he
had not rescued from the waves the
strong arms that earned its fuel.
Many a mother felt something queer
in her throat and in the corners of
her eyes when she saw the great shaggy
brute, and thought of a certain little
head that might long ago have
been pillowed in the sea-weeds.</p>

<p>But when the feast of our Lady of
Larmor came, ah! then Fanor was
in his glory. Did he walk in the procession?
Of course he did! Did he
not know what was the proper thing
for a respectable dog to do and where
his right place was, after the banners?
"Ah!" said Jacques, "he's a Christian.
He's no dog; he is almost a man."</p>

<p>After Jacques, and Fine-Anguille,
and the sea, Ange was the dearest
friend of this dog. Fanor paid the
most delicate attentions to this little
fellow. He kept back his strength
and refrained from those boisterous
leaps; he gave Ange a thousand tender
caresses with his great cold nose
and with his paw; and, when he licked
his hands, he scarcely moistened
them. It was plain that he was in
love with this baby. And as for
Jeanne, she loved nothing in the world
besides Jacques and Ange and the dog.</p>

<p>For you and me, and the thoughtless
or busy world, what a grand sight
to watch the sea in September! so
deep, so dark, it falls and rises with
ever-increasing majesty. There is a
menace in its ceaseless roll, its beauty
is terribly grand, and from the shore
we admire its strength and its immensity.
But how differently it appears
to the poor fisher's wife! For her there
is nothing to admire in the ocean.
For her it is only a source of anxiety
and dread. How gloomy to her is
the evening as it settles over this ever-tossing
plain; how her heart starts at
the vague threats of the wind! This
blue and white-crested mass is perhaps
a shroud. Is there no moaning
save that which the listless water
makes? And, when the horizon lowers,
is the wild call of the sea-bird the
only strange cry that can be heard?
And, as the wind sweeps from the
stormy offing, we perhaps think it
beautiful. But to the fisher's wife it
is dreadful. She fears for him who
toils in the abyss. What can a little
shell like Fine-Anguille and a man
and a dog do against the ocean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>We may say, "How beautiful!"
But she cries, "Holy Virgin! the sea
is too high! Sweet Jesus! it blows
too, too hard."</p>

<p>One day Jeanne was with Ange on
the beach and Jacques was preparing
Fine-Anguille for fishing. Jeanne sat,
knitting, by the water's side. Ange
had kicked off one of his little wooden
shoes, and with his rosy little foot
was playing in the water. He laughed,
he shouted, he splashed the little
waves that ran softly upon the sand.
Ah! what grand fun he was having.</p>

<p>It was evening. The setting sun
bathed the entire coast in purple, and
the water, still and peaceful, reflected
this scene of splendor.</p>

<p>Ange had tied a string to his little
shoe and had thrown it out on the
water.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said he, "look! see my
Fine-Anguille! In a minute I am going
to make a storm."</p>

<p>And he splashed away with his bare
foot.</p>

<p>The little shoe tossed from one side
to another; finally it filled with water.
Jeanne looked up and said. "Naughty
boy! put on your shoe. Quick!"</p>

<p>Just then, somebody touched her
shoulder. It was a stranger, from
Paris, perhaps. This seemed probable
from the haughty air, which people
from the city always have, and
also from his cold, harsh look and his
pale countenance.</p>

<p>Jeanne was frightened.</p>

<p>"I want a boat," said this strange
person, "to go out into the offing."
Jacques approached. "If you like,
sir, I am ready. Here, Fanor!"</p>

<p>"What! take that brute along with
us? Horrid cur! He is filthy and
smells of old fish. I can't bear him
for a companion."</p>

<p>"I will not go without my dog,"
said Jacques.</p>

<p>"Come!" said the stranger, "this
beast is of no use. I will give you
a louis to leave the dog." Jacque
looked at his wife hesitatingly. Jeanne
was pale. The stranger tossed the
louis in his hand.</p>

<p>Just then Ange cried, "My shoe
has gone to the bottom!" And Jeanne
said, "Don't go without the dog."</p>

<p>Soon the Fine-Anguille left the
shore, and, breaking through the rosy
water, disappeared in the distance,
like a faint cloud.</p>

<p>Jeanne turned again toward the
house, carrying her child, whose little
foot hung bare over her dress.</p>

<p>When she reached the heights, she
turned to scan the horizon. She saw
a thick gray band stretched along it.
Seized with anxious foreboding, she
paused.</p>

<p>"Will it be fair?" she asked of Father
Lucas, the cow-herd. "What
sort of a night will they have over by
the Thunder Rocks and the White
Mare, and in the offing?"</p>

<p>Father Lucas, in turn, scanned the
horizon. "Fine-Anguille is a good
sea boat!" said he; and passed on
with his cows.</p>

<p>"It is the wind!" thought Jeanne,
as Ange by an unconscious movement
covered his foot with her apron.
"It is the wind! God be merciful
to us!" Then she entered the house.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock gusts began to blow.
The waves moaned piteously. Jeanne
could not sleep. But neither the
moaning of wind nor wave could disturb
Ange as he lay wrapped snugly
in his cradle. His mother struck a
light. One is not so much frightened
when one can see clearly. Then it
seems as if one could do any thing;
but what can one do against the
wind?</p>

<p>"The wind! O my God! the
wind," cried Jeanne. "But, at any
rate, Fanor is with him!"</p>

<p>Then, as every thing creaked and
moaned around her, she fell into a
light slumber. She saw the great sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
with its frightful gulfs, its white yawning
mouth and threatening rocks, and
its deceitful shoals. She saw her child
on the beach, splashing the water with
his naked foot. She saw the little
wooden shoe which had been ship-wrecked.
Then she heard the voice
of Ange murmuring, "I'll make a
storm!"</p>

<p>Jeanne trembled.</p>

<p>Then, as the roof of the cottage
moved and creaked, she remembered
how the waves had entered the little
shoe.</p>

<p>All at once she rose up and took
Ange, fast asleep, in her arms. She
threw her cape over her shoulders.
It was raining hard and the wind
blew strongly. She lit a lantern; a
sudden gust put it out, and she was
left in the black darkness. But the
surf made so much noise that it served
as a guide. She reached the beach
in safety.</p>

<p>"Ange! O Ange! if Fine-Anguille
has perished!"</p>

<p>The belfry of Larmor stood black
in the sombre night, and the sea
dashed its white foam at the very
steps of the church.</p>

<p>Jeanne seated herself on the damp
sill, and, wrapping Ange in her cloak,
waited with longing eyes, counting
every wave.</p>

<p>Slowly the day broke, and the storm
abated as the sun rose. It shone first
on the fortress of Port-Louis, then
along the rest of the coast; and
Jeanne saw the little wooden shoe
broken among the pebbles&mdash;"Broken!
and yet so light! It ought to have
floated!"</p>

<p>Then Jeanne saw the Fine-Anguille.
Her sail was rent and tattered.
Her broken mast hung half in the
water. All that could be hoped was
that she might come in with the tide,
and that Jacques would be able to
avoid the rocks. Perhaps they still
preserved their oars! As she listened,
she thought she heard them striking
on the row-locks; but no, it was the
wind. The broken mast might still
serve to hold them off the rocks. Already
she could hear Fanor's voice.
But on the heaving plain her glance
could barely follow the little craft.
Finally, as a sudden gust blew afresh,
it disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>Jeanne closed her eyes. And, when
they reopened, Jacques and Fanor
were beside her. Jacques was pale;
Fanor with red, distended nostrils, and
panting, shook the water from his
shaggy coat.</p>

<p>"Wife," said Jacques, "we have
been very unlucky! We beat all night
against the wind. I wished to come
in last evening after we had doubled
the citadel; I knew it would blow.
But that fool of a Parisian would see
the offing! He is dead now. God
have mercy on him! I have never
worked so hard in all my life! To
lighten the boat he wanted to drown
Fanor. And when he saw the breakers,
he would jump overboard to
swim. Fanor went after him and
brought him to the gunwale; and,
while I was lending him a hand,
puff! we were all in the water together.
Holy Mother! how I did lay
about me. I caught a plank. 'Hold
on, Fanor!' said I. But Fanor had
left the stranger and had seized me
by the collar. And so I made the
shore. O the brave beast! he's no
dog; he is almost a man!"</p>

<p>"And Fine-Anguille?" said Jeanne.</p>

<p>"She will come in with the tide.
She is as light as a wooden shoe."</p>

<h2>CARDINAL POLE.</h2>


<p>Cardinal Pole was a representative
man. As Archbishop of Canterbury
he stands in direct contrast to
Cranmer. Each of these primates
was at the head of a host during a
period of mortal conflict. They led
respectively the forces of the old and
of the new faith. Pole represented
the Catholics of England, especially
the wiser and better part of them.
Cranmer was one of the feeblest and
worst specimens of the reformers.
He had not even the unenviable
merit of being true to his own principles.
He could not stand the shock
of battle, and though a standard-bearer,
he surrendered his colors in
the hope of saving his life. Pole, on
the contrary, suffered persecution for
righteousness' sake, and the cruel fate
of his mother and his near relatives
warned him but too plainly of the end
that awaited him if he should ever
come within reach of the tyrant. Let
us trace his history, though but in
outline; for we shall find it full of interesting
matter, food for reflection,
and lessons of piety. There are
many men of less importance and
less merit whose lives are better
known than his. One who enjoyed
his friendship during many years&mdash;Ludovico
Beccatelli, Archbishop of
Ragusa&mdash;has left us a record of his
acts, and painted his character with
a faithful hand. To him principally,
and to Cardinal Pole's own writings,
we are indebted for what we have
learned respecting him; for though
much is to be found on the subject
of his career in the pages of Lingard,
Strype, Flanagan, Hume, Strickland,
and Froude, it is to those higher
sources especially, together with the
state papers of the time, that every
one must remount who would obtain
reliable information.</p>

<p>It was when Henry VII. had passed
the middle of his reign, and Alexander
VI. filled the papal chair, that
Reginald Pole was born at Stowerton
Castle in Staffordshire. His father
was Sir Richard Pole, (afterward
Lord Montacute, or Montague,) a
Welsh knight, and his mother was
Mary, Countess of Salisbury, daughter
of that Duke of Clarence whom
Edward IV. drowned in a butt of
Malmsey. He was the cousin also
of Elizabeth, Queen of Henry VII.
and mother of Henry VIII. He had
thus all the advantages which people
attach to high descent, and no pains
were spared to give him an education
suited to his rank and prospects.
The monasteries were then schools for
the instruction of boys of good family,
and to one of these Reginald was
sent when a child. It was the Carthusian
monastery at Shene, from whence
he was removed in time to Magdalen
College, Oxford, where he laid the
foundation of his future learning, and
was taught by the celebrated Linacre,
the preceptor of Prince Arthur,
and physician to Henry VIII. and the
Princess Mary.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> His education was
carried on at the cost of Henry; for
which reason he often in after life
spoke of the king with gratitude.
He was but a boy when he obtained
his degree of B.A., and might (like
Wolsey, who graduated at Oxford
when fourteen years old) have been
called the "Boy Bachelor." He was
also admitted very early into deacons'
orders; at seventeen he was made
Prebendary of Salisbury; and at nineteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>Dean of Wimborne and Exeter.</p>

<p>The reformation had not yet broken
out. England was ruled without
a parliament by the all-powerful minister
Cardinal Wolsey; and Henry
VIII., who had in 1513, when Pole
was at Oxford, won the battle of the
Spurs and taken Tournay, appeared
for a moment as a competitor for the
imperial crown on the death of Maximilian.
It was part of his good
pleasure that Reginald Pole should
be highly educated, and accordingly
about the year 1520, when the youth
was twenty years old, he caused him
to repair to the University of Padua
to complete his studies. Reginald
resided in that seat of learning in
great splendor. A numerous retinue
attended him, and he enjoyed the society
and esteem of many eminent
persons, such as Bembo<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
and Sadolet.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
His morals were pure, his manners
graceful, and his amiability made
him much beloved.</p>

<p>After five years of university life, he
returned to England, and was received
by Henry with many marks
of royal favor. But he shunned the
splendors and seductions of the court,
and retired to a house that had belonged
to Dean Colet within the Carthusian
monastery at Shene. Henry's
erratic career had begun; and
he was seeking to obtain a divorce
from his faithful and virtuous wife,
Catharine of Aragon. Reginald earnestly
desired to escape the complications
that were likely to ensue.
He knew that a storm was gathering;
and after two years of retirement at
Shene, he obtained Henry's permission
to pursue his studies at the University
of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> He was not yet
priests' orders, neither had he taken
monastic vows. For this a curious
reason was assigned.</p>

<p>All the contemporaries of Queen
Catharine affirm that she earnestly
desired a union in marriage between
her daughter, the Princess Mary and
Reginald Pole. His mother, the
Countess of Salisbury, had always resided
with Mary, and the biographers
of Pole with one voice declare that
Mary had regarded him with favor
from earliest childhood. We ought
not, however, to lay too much stress
on this fact, since the disparity of
their ages was too great to admit of
their being lovers at an early period
of life. Reginald was sixteen years
older than Mary, yet it is not surprising
that, when her proposed marriage
with the Emperor of Germany
was broken off, and Reginald, having
returned to England, appeared at
court in his twenty-fifth year conspicuous
for the culture of his mind and
the beauty of his person, the queen
should wish to see him become the
husband of her child. He was of
royal blood, and very nearly resembled
his ancestor Edward III. and
his great-uncle Edward IV. His
portrait was taken by Michael Angelo
for that of the Saviour of men in the
grand painting of the Raising of
Lazarus. He revived, therefore, in
his carriage and features the memory
of the heroic Plantagenets from whom
he descended. Already renowned
for learning, and with a mind enriched
with travel and residence in foreign
lands, he had frequent opportunities
of seeing the lovely Mary
who would probably one day be
Queen of England. Lady Salisbury
still lived with her, and she was both
her relative and friend. The princess
showed great partiality for the
noble and accomplished Reginald;
and at a much later period a marriage
was proposed between them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
a matter of state convenience, but
without its being very long or seriously
entertained.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Reginald was not suffered to remain
long in peace at the University
of Paris. An order arrived requiring
him to procure opinions favorable to
the divorce, in concert with Langet,
the brother of the Bishop of Bayonne.
The task was ungrateful to him, full
of danger, and hardly to be executed
with a clear conscience. He resigned
it to his colleague, and was soon
recalled. He might have succeeded
Wolsey in the see of York, and possibly
Warham in that of Canterbury,
had he been willing to pander to the
vicious inclinations of his royal master.
He wavered, indeed, for a moment,
and fancied he had found an
expedient by which he might satisfy
Henry without wounding his own
conscience. He repaired to Whitehall
Palace, and there, in the stately
gallery, he stood before the anti-christian
king. He loved that king
in spite of his wickedness; for he
owed to him his education, together
with many dignities and splendors.
He loved him too well to deceive him.
The truth could not be suppressed.
It wrought within him like a pent-up
fire. His feelings overcame him, and
he burst into tears. It was enough
to stir the king's displeasure. It revealed
the secret workings of Reginald's
mind. The divorce would be
a crime&mdash;a horrible crime. The reasons
assigned in its favor were flimsy
deceits. The helpless queen and her
daughter would be victims moving
all hearts to pity. Henry frowned,
and his hand often sought the dagger's
hilt; but though Reginald wept,
it was not likely a Plantagenet should
fear. Upon quitting the gallery, Reginald
was loaded with the bitterest
reproaches by his brothers, and especially
by Lord Montague. He
was induced to write to the king.
He explained his motives in language
equally firm and temperate; and
Henry, into whom the demons had
not yet fully entered, took the letter,
or professed to take it, in good part.
He declared that he loved Pole in
spite of his obstinacy, and that, if his
opinion were only favorable to the
divorce, he should love him more
than any man in the kingdom. History
has taught us how much his
love was worth; for his embraces were
sure pledges of ruin and destruction.
He did not, however, withdraw Reginald's
pension of five hundred
crowns, but allowed him to leave
England again.</p>

<p>Having emphatically declared his
dissent from the resolutions of parliament
and convocation, Pole found
his position more and more uneasy.
He turned his face again to the south,
and in 1532 took up his residence for
a time at Avignon. During his absence
the fatal divorce was completed,
and the doom of England as
a Catholic country was sealed. The
thought of returning to it became distasteful;
and he retired to the monastery
of Carpentras, and subsequently
to his old quarters at Padua. His
leave of absence was extended. He
was enabled to visit Venice. His
pension was duly paid; he received
the revenues of the deanery of Exeter,
and was specially exempted from
the obligation of swearing allegiance
to the children of Anne Boleyn. So
far forbearance was shown toward
him, and he was not insensible to
the indulgence. He always in after
life retained the same feelings, and
even his bitterest invectives were
softened with notes of love.</p>

<p>In the year 1535, when he was in
his thirty-fifth year, (for, being born
in 1500, his years run with the century,)
Pole was requested to send in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
opinion on the authority claimed in
England by the see of Rome. A similar
request was made to all other
English noblemen and gentlemen; for
Henry in his worst deeds endeavored
to fortify himself by public opinion;
and when doctors at the universities
resisted his will, he overcame their
scruples by the help of menacing letters.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Mr. Starkey, a personal acquaintance,
was commissioned to correspond
with Pole, and he advised
him to avoid his previous errors. He
was to say distinctly and honestly
whether he approved the divorce and
the separation from Rome&mdash;whether
they were, in his opinion, right or
wrong in the abstract, and not whether
they might be defended on grounds
of expediency. He insisted the more
on this distinction, because, as we
have seen, when Pole was first consulted
by Henry about the separation
from Catharine, he had hesitated, requested
time for consideration, and
tried to discover reasons for complying
with his sovereign's wishes.</p>

<p>But years had passed since that trying
occasion. The germs of evils had
rapidly developed. Henry's character
had unfolded; Pole's had matured.
Their divergence had become antagonism;
and Pole was in no way disposed
to let the opportunity now afforded
him escape. It was the time
to write what contemporaries widely
scattered, and even posterity, might
read. Brief answers to brief questions
would do for the king; but a volume
would do better for Rome, the
courts of Europe, the people of England,
and the angry glances of the
lawless prince himself. He intended
it, no doubt, for Henry's perusal in
the first instance; but he could hardly
doubt that what he might speak in
secret chambers would be proclaimed
from the house-tops. He showed the
manuscript in parts to Cardinal Contarini.
The language was impassioned
and almost violent. The cardinal
advised discretion, and ended by protesting
against what he considered
fruitless invective. To this Reginald
replied that he knew the king's character
well. He had been too much
flattered. No one had durst tell him
the truth. He could not be moved
by gentleness. His eyes ought to be
opened by the plainest speaking, and
the censures of the church ought long
ago to have fallen upon him. It was
not for his sake only that Pole wrote;
he had the welfare of the flock of
Christ in his heart. He was determined
to expose the matter fully, that
king and people might be thoroughly
warned.</p>

<p>In the mean time the emperor's designs
on England were abandoned;
and the quarrel between him and
Henry seemed likely to be brought
to a peaceful issue. Thus one hope
which Pole entertained of seeing divine
judgments fall on the king of
England was blighted. Yet his book
must be completed. The king must
have the first reading of it. He would
not even submit it to Pope Paul III.
through Cardinal Contarini. Perhaps
he feared that his holiness would think
it ill-timed or intemperate. We certainly
find him lamenting that the
pope did not convince the emperor
how much more blessed it would be
to fight with Henry than with the
Turks&mdash;to be the champion of the
Christian faith in Europe, and drive
back the fearful encroachments of
heresy.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>At length, in May, 1536, Pole's <cite>De
Unitate EcclesiÃ¦</cite>, was completed. His
ardent disposition and his indignant
piety found vent in this composition,
and it rolled along like a river swollen
by rains. The very passages in
it which Mr. Froude holds up to reprobation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>and scorn are those which
Catholics in general will regard with
the most pleasure; they will strike
upon their ears as the voice of one crying
in the wilderness, and denouncing
in just and measured terms the crimes
of a royal heresiarch. It will appear
to them instinct with affection rather
than hatred. "I will cry in your
ears," he says, "as in the ears of a
dead man&mdash;dead in your sins. I
love you&mdash;wicked as you are, I love
you. I hope for you, and may God
hear my prayer. I should be a traitor
did I conceal from you the truth.
I owe my learning to your care." He
draws a hideous picture of Henry's
guilt and presumption, and then proceeds
to dissect a book which Henry
had sent him on the supremacy by
Dr. Sampson, Bishop of Chichester.
He inveighs against the abuse which
Henry made of his regal power, maintaining
that the king exists for the
people, not the people for the king.
He makes the people the source of
kingly power; and his words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">populus
regem procreat</i>, "the people make the
king," involve a distinct denial of</p>

<p class="center">
"The right divine of kings to govern wrong."<br />
</p>

<p>He subordinates the regal office to
that of the priest, and in language
singularly modern, he asserts that sovereigns
are responsible to their people,
and that Henry, by breaking his
coronation oath, has forfeited his right
to the crown, and justified the rebellion
of his subjects.</p>

<p>The third and most important section
follows. It is addressed to Henry
VIII., to England, to the emperor,
and to the Spanish army. He accuses
the king of intriguing with Mary
Boleyn before his marriage with
Anne, and brands the "supreme head
of the church" as the "vilest of plunderers,
a thief, and a robber." He
relates in forcible language the story
of the martyrdom of Sir Thomas
More, Bishop Fisher, and the Charterhouse
monks. He calls on England
loudly to rebel.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"O my country!" he says, "if any memory
remains to you of your ancient liberties,
remember&mdash;remember the time when
kings who ruled over you unjustly were
called to account by the authority of your
laws. They tell you that all is the king's.
I tell you that all is the commonwealth's.
You my country, are all. The king is but
your servant and minister."</p></blockquote>

<p>No trumpet of revolt could blow
louder, yet Pole did not stop even
here. He proclaimed his intention
of exciting the Emperor Charles to
invade England, and to assemble under
his banner all those English who
remained true to God and his holy
church. This part of the treatise,
when printed, was circulated as a
pamphlet in the German States. It
protested that Pole acted in the love
of his country, and "in that love of
the church which was given him by
the Son of God." The Spaniards above
all men were bound in his view to
vindicate the honor of the noble
daughter of Isabella of Castile, whom
Henry had divorced. The king of
France, he believed, would make
peace with the emperor, and at the
pope's bidding undertake the chastisement
of the towering enemy of God
and man.</p>

<p>But the address is not all rebuke
and menace; the tones of wrath melt
into tenderness at the last, and die
away in exhortation to repentance
and promises of mercy. It effected
little. Catharine of Aragon died in
Kimbolton Castle in the same year
in which it came to hand, and Anne
Boleyn, four months later, passed from
the bridal-chamber to the scaffold.
Henry had broken for ever with the
holy see, and England, torn from the
centre of unity, sank and wandered
in an abyss. The book was sent to
England from Venice on the 27th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
May, 1536. It was accompanied
by two letters, one to the king, the
other to Tunstall, Bishop of Durham.
The bishop was to read for the king
what was intended for his majesty only.
By which we must understand that,
if the treatise produced the desired
effect on Henry's mind, it would be
considered as a secret communication;
but if it failed, the author would
then be at liberty to publish it to the
world. It is not certain that Henry
ever read it. He heard reports of it,
however, from Tunstall and Starkey,
and made no mystery of his displeasure
to those around him. To Pole
himself he wrote briefly, requiring him
to return to England and explain his
ideas more fully. Starkey and Tunstall
wrote also, pointing out Reginald's
presumption, which, they said,
if persevered in would become a crime,
and urging him to return to England,
and seek the king's pardon. Pole
was far too astute to obey this summons.
Other letters were addressed
to him, and finding that he would
not venture on the English shore,
Henry's agents tried to persuade him
not to publish the work, and to give
up or burn any copies of it which he
might have retained. But this request
was as fruitless as the former. Pole
continued for a time to receive his
pension, and his book, the effects of
which were likely to be formidable,
was reserved in manuscript till a fitting
occasion for publishing it should
arise.</p>

<p>Being an English subject, in the
enjoyment of certain emoluments and
dignities, Reginald Pole was not altogether
free in his movements abroad.
He could not accept an invitation from
the pope to visit him at Rome without
first obtaining Henry's permission,
or without, at least, expressing a hope
that his majesty would not be offended
if he repaired to the eternal city.
Henry did not deign to reply, but he
induced Reginald's mother and brothers,
Cromwell, and his friends at
home, together with some members
of both houses of parliament, to endeavor
to deter him from the journey
and from accepting any office that
might be offered him in Rome. For
a time, therefore, he resisted the importunities
of his friend Contarini,
and declined the purple held out to
him by Pope Paul III.; for he knew
that in accepting it he should make
the king his implacable enemy and
expose his family to cruel persecution.
But other circumstances arose, which
made the cardinalate appear desirable;
and he accepted it about Christmas,
1536,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and trusted that it might
in the issue aid him in accomplishing
the main purpose of his life. That
purpose was the recovery of England,
in part at least, if not entirely, to the
Catholic faith. The rising in England
which he had predicted had taken
place. The suppression of the
monasteries had filled the faithful in
the north with indignation, and from
the Wash to the borders of Scotland
the people in general flew to arms.
They bore on their standards the emblems
of faith, and the image of Christ
crucified was carried in their front.
The revolt was styled the "Pilgrimage
of Grace," and its object was not
the overthrow of the throne or the
sovereign, but the removal from him
of all evil counsellors and "villein's
blood." It is deeply to the disgrace
of Englishmen that they did not rise
to a man and support the cause of
freedom and religion against the worst
of tyrants. Pole was anxious to afford
the insurgents all the assistance
in his power, and to remove from them
and from the English in general any
pretext for acquiescence in the changes
forced upon them. A legate's commission
was granted him, and he was instructed
to land in England, or to hover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>over its coasts in France or Flanders
as circumstances might require.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
He knew not whether the insurrection
were crushed, or whether Henry, on
the contrary, were in the power of
the rebels. He therefore man&oelig;uvred
with the English government till things
should take a decisive turn, and executed
his commission with delicacy
and dexterity. His professed object
was to receive in Flanders such commissioners
from the king as he might
think proper to send for the purpose
of discussing the points at issue between
the government and the pope.
He brought with him as credentials
five letters; one to the Catholic people
of England; a second to James
of Scotland; a third to Francis King
of France; a fourth to the Regent of
the Netherlands; and a fifth to the
Prince Bishop of Liege. He was
ready to treat with Henry on any reasonable
terms, and hopes were still
entertained at Rome of England's being
reconciled to the holy see. He
was instructed to exhort the emperor
and the King of France to cease hostilities
against each other, and to turn
their arms against the Turks. By this
means they would forward the supreme
pastor's design of convening a
general council for the reformation of
manners and the reconcilement of nations
which had fallen from the faith
to the unity of Christendom.</p>

<p>No sooner had Pole entered France
than the English ambassador there
required that he should be delivered
up, and sent as a prisoner to England.
The lengths to which Henry VIII.
had gone altered the position of his
Catholic subjects, and to be faithful
to God and the holy see was to be nothing
less than a traitor. Reginald Pole
especially had incurred this charge,
and as soon as it suited Henry's purpose,
he preferred it against him without
scruple. The king of France refused
to deliver him up, but he requested
Pole not to ask for an audience,
and to prosecute his journey as speedily
as possible. A treaty with England
obliged the French government to
give no shelter to political offenders,
and Pole was compelled to turn aside
from Paris and repair to Cambray.
His welcome there was no warmer
than in France. The Regent of the
Netherlands had been terrified by
Henry, and Pole was conveyed under
an escort to Liege. A price of
fifty thousand crowns was put on his
head by the king of England, and
four thousand auxiliaries were offered
to the emperor to aid him in his
campaign against France, provided
he would deliver up the person of the
cardinal into Henry's hands. The
hatred of the king became implacable,
and he pursued Pole ever after with
the most murderous intentions.</p>

<p>From his watch-tower at Liege,
Reginald beheld with bitter regret the
failure of every attempt at insurrection
in England. Alternate hopes and
fears preyed on his mind. Conspiracy
against the king seemed to offer
the only chance of averting the triumph
of Protestantism in England.
Rebellion assumed in his eyes a sacred
character, and every insurgent
who fell wore the glory of martyrdom.
He would willingly have seen
his relations plotting against the author
of untold evils to mankind. But
a rumor was spread abroad of his life
being in danger; that assassins were
employed by Henry to murder him;
and the holy father, anxious to preserve
so valuable a life, recalled him
to Italy. He was bent on publishing
his book in defence of the church's
unity, and desired to do so under
the pope's auspices. In a letter to
his secretary, Michael Throgmorton,
Cromwell, who was then Henry's
chief adviser, heaped reproaches upon
Pole for his treason, dared him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
publish his book if he thought fit, defended
his master's resistance of papal
authority, and intimated that Henry
could find means to avenge himself
on Cardinal Pole, even though he
should be "tied to the pope's girdle."
The times, it must be confessed, were
most painful and trying; wickedness
in high places forced many persons
from their allegiance against their will
who would have been, under happier
circumstances, the most loyal and devoted
of subjects. The mind of Cardinal
Pole was deeply imbued with a
love of the Catholic religion, and
wherever he might be, whatever he
might be doing, his unique object was
its reÃ«stablishment in his beloved and
native land.</p>

<p>In June, 1538, we catch a glimpse
of Cardinal Pole among the orange-groves
that skirt the water's edge on
the beautiful bay of Nice. Hither
he came as attendant on the pope in
a congress which resulted in a truce
between France and Spain. But the
name of Henry VIII. was not mentioned
in the treaty on which the sovereigns
agreed. The pope and the
princes were left free to act toward
him or against him as they might
think fit.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1539
Pole's book was printed, and sown
broadcast over Europe. Many additions
had been made to it, and the
excesses into which King Henry had
rushed increased the vehement indignation
of the author. The pope, also,
at the same time, issued his bull of
deposition against the apostate prince.
His crimes could no longer be endured;
the putrid member must be lopped
off from the body of the church.
Cardinal Pole himself was despatched
on another mission, the object of which
was to arouse the Emperor Charles
V. to an invasion of England. He
addressed an apology to the emperor
explaining his conduct, lest his majesty
should fail to see how fealty to the
King of kings may sometimes oblige
a subject to disown allegiance to an
earthly sovereign.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another rising was meditated
in England. The Pilgrimage
of Grace had failed, but the moment
was propitious for another attempt.
The Catholic forces of the empire
would be stirred against Henry by the
pope and Cardinal Pole, and the pacification
of Nice had brought Europe
into the condition most adverse to
the schismatic king. The plot was
discovered by the government, and
suspicions fell on the relatives of Pole.
He was believed to have been in correspondence
with them, and to have
excited them to conspire and rebel.
His brother, Sir Geoffrey Pole, turned
king's evidence, and his accusations
were accepted as truthful; though the
word of a traitor to his own party is
as much to be despised as himself.
Knowing, as we do, that the heart of
Cardinal Pole was burning with a desire
of Henry's overthrow, it will be
to us a question of small interest whether
he really instigated his friends to
revolt or not. Neither shall we be
very careful to inquire into the validity
or invalidity of the charges against
his kinsfolk. If faithful to the king,
they were unfaithful to God; if rebels
against his authority, they were valiant
for the truth. The evidence obtained
in their disfavor was presumptive only;
it proved, indeed, something as to their
general tendencies; but it was not
sufficient for their just condemnation.
They had one crime which could not
be pardoned; they were near relations
of Reginald Pole. The king had not
a more dangerous enemy than he beyond
the seas; and the accused persons
were all of them more or less of
royal blood; all capable, on occasion,
of setting up a rival claim to the
throne, and making their descent,
titles, property, and influence means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
of supplanting the reigning prince.
The Marquis of Exeter, Lord Montague,
and Sir Edward Neville were beheaded
on Tower Hill, December 9th,
1538.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Lady Salisbury was made to
endure a cruel imprisonment, and deprived
of all her property; nor could
she even purchase a warm garment
to protect her aged limbs.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> When
more than seventy years of age, she
was brought to the block. "Blessed
are they that suffer for righteousness'
sake," were her last words. The effect
of these judicial murders on Cardinal
Pole's mind may easily be conceived.
Other injuries may be forgotten
or forgiven, but this shedding
of the blood of innocent and beloved
relatives is a crime that never ceases
to cry to heaven for vengeance.</p>

<p>Pole's mission to Charles V. produced
little effect. Some warlike demonstrations
were made against Henry,
but the emperor soon assured the
legate that it was impossible for him
at that time to proceed further. Reginald
Pole was bitterly disappointed.
Again his hope of the church's triumph
and Henry's discomfiture was blasted.
He saw the wicked in great prosperity
and flourishing like a green bay
tree. But his strength and consolation
was in the inner life. "For me,"
he wrote, "the heavier the load of my
affliction for God and the church, the
higher do I mount upon the ladder
of felicity."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> There were those who
accused him of nourishing a hope
that he should one day be king of
England; but perhaps they have ascribed
to him what was only the foolish
dream of some fond admirers.</p>

<p>This legation was a mockery and a
cross. He was bandied about from
Toledo to Avignon; from Charles V.
to Francis. Neither sovereign could
be induced to unite against the king
of England. Francis refused to receive
the legate unless he brought
with him some written pledge of the
emperor's sincerity, and Charles refused
to give that pledge unless the
cardinal had first been received by
Francis. Pole saw that he was cajoled
by both.</p>

<p>Once more he vacated diplomatic
functions. Once more he retired within
the cloister at Carpentras,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> to hide
his face in mourning and prayer, to
ponder the torments of his saintly
mother, and fix his weeping eyes in
solitude on the image of his crucified
Lord. The emperor had tamely declined
to fight the battles of Jehovah,
and his supineness added wormwood
to Pole's bitter cup. Paul III. had
compassion on his distress, and need
of his counsels. He recalled him
from his retreat near Avignon&mdash;from
the ruins of the Temple of Diana at
Carpentras, to the life and energy of
Christian Rome.</p>

<p>The hatred of Henry toward Cardinal
Pole was increased by this last
attempt to band the most powerful
princes of Europe against him. "Judgment
of treason" was pronounced on
him in England; and efforts were
made to induce foreign governments
to deliver him up. His steps were
tracked by spies; his goings in and
out were watched; and he believed
the poniards of assassins to be often
brandished near him. His aged mother,
the venerable Countess of Salisbury,
was brought to the block,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> as
we have already mentioned. No examination
had extracted evidence of
her guilt; no ground for a criminal
prosecution could be discovered. She
was attainted without previous trial
or confession; for Henry and his abject
minion, Cromwell, were as indifferent
to the forms of law as to the
substance of justice. Her name, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>with that of Pole's nephew,
the son of Lord Montague, and that
of Gertrude the Marchioness of Exeter,
was introduced into a bill of attainder,
though neither of them had
confessed any crime or had been placed
upon trial with means of defence.
The marchioness was pardoned in six
months; of the fate of the young man
no record remains; but the aged countess,
who was the last in a direct line
of the Plantagenets, who was the nearest
relation in blood that Henry had,
and of whom in former days the king
had often said that she was the holiest
woman in Christendom, was dragged
from the tower to the scaffold after a
confinement of two years, and commanded
to lay her head on the block.</p>

<p>"My head," she replied, "never
committed treason. If you will have
it, you must take it as you can."</p>

<p>The executioner performed his office
while the head was held down by
force. Reginald Pole ever after regarded
himself as the son of a martyr,
and accounted that a higher honor
than to be born of a royal line.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>His long residence abroad after his
mother's death was not marked by
events of sufficient importance to require
very special record. At Rome,
the pope granted him a guard, that he
might be protected from plots against
his life contrived by the revengeful
Henry. He corresponded largely
with persons of distinction in various
countries, and his letters, which were
published at Brescia (Brixia) in five
volumes quarto, in 1754-57, under the
editorship of Cardinal Quirinus, are
highly circumstantial, and contain
abundant matter of historical interest
and closely connected with the lives
of Pope Paul III., the Emperor
Charles V., the King of Scots, Edward
VI., Mary, and Elizabeth. In
1562, a work of his appeared, entitled,
<cite>De Concilio Liber</cite>; and in the same
year, at Rome, edited by P. Manutius,
<cite>Reformatio AngliÃ¦, ex decretis Reginaldi
Poli Cardinalis</cite>. Two volumes,
quarto. The book on councils was
written by Pole as president of the
Council of Trent in 1545; and Phillips,
in his life of him,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> speaks of it as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A treatise which, for perspicuity, good
sense, and solid reasoning, is equal to the importance
of the occasion on which it was written,
and shows at once the reach and ease of
the author's genius, and the goodness of his
heart. The preface by Manutius is long, and
one of the most elegant compositions in the
Latin language."</p></blockquote>

<p>Cardinal Pole's life of exile, therefore,
was neither idle nor fruitless.
The labors which his hand then
wrought remain to this day, and are
highly prized by all who love to trace
the stream of history to its fountain
head. The year after Cromwell's disgrace
and death (1541) Pole was appointed
Governor of the Province of
the Patrimony of St. Peter&mdash;the only
part of the States of the Church which
is now left to the Bishop of Rome.
By this kindness on the part of Paul
III., the cardinal was relieved of a
disagreeable dependence on foreign
princes for his daily expenses. His
government was marked by wisdom,
gentleness, and moderation. He always
discouraged severity, though he
held firmly the right of the church to
punish offenders. His leisure hours
were devoted to literature, and in the
writings of ancient and modern poets
and sages he often forgot, for a time,
the miseries of his country, and the
dangers which, even in Italy, beset
his own person.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Disorders among the clergy, a general
corruption of morals, the schism
of Luther, and the excesses of Calvin
conspired to make a general council
the obvious and only remedy that
could be applied. Cardinal Pole and
two other legates were nominated by
Pope Paul III. to preside at the Council
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>of Trent in the year 1542. But
the sittings were suspended amid
the din of arms, and renewed three
years later in the same city. Cardinal
Pole then presided again, having
on his journey been tracked from place
to place by ruffians employed by
Henry VIII. to dispatch him at all hazards.
Such atrocity, however, did
not exasperate Pole unduly, nor cause
him to forfeit his character for clemency
and moderation. It was, on the
contrary, objected to him in Italy, as
afterward in England, that he was
too lenient. It was even laid to his
charge, and made an argument against
his being raised to the popedom, that
during his administration as governor
two persons only had been put to death.
He lived, alas! in an age when laws
were sanguinary, and human life was
comparatively of trifling account.</p>

<p>Cardinal Pole rendered valuable assistance
in the early stages of the Council
of Trent; but in 1546, he was
obliged to discontinue his sittings and
retire, first to Padua, and afterward to
Rome, in consequence of ill health.
The decree of the council concerning
justification,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> as it now stands, was
revised and completed by him. It is
a monument of luminous and concise
statement of scriptural truth, and
perfectly reconciles passages at first
sight discrepant in the epistles of St.
Paul and St. James.</p>

<p>When Henry VIII. was gone to
his account, and the young Edward
mounted the vacant throne, Cardinal
Pole made two unsuccessful efforts
to incline the thoughts of that
young prince favorably toward the true
and ancient religion. But Edward
VI. in his tender years was surrounded
by persons who made it their business
to misrepresent every thing connected
with the Catholic Church.
The boy-king was thus made the tool
and victim of crafty and ambitious men,
who reared the structure of their own
fortunes out of a pile of sacrilege.</p>

<p>When Paul III. died in November,
1549, Cardinal Pole was at the head
of his council, and governor of Viterbo.
The larger part of the cardinals
were desirous of electing him to the
vacant chair; but the number of votes
required being two thirds, the choice
did not ultimately fall on him. It
was not the design of Providence that
he should either be pope of Rome or
king of England; yet he was very near
being the successor of Paul III. on one
occasion, and the husband of Mary,
Queen of England, on others. During
the sitting of the conclave he
wrote an essay, which was afterward
published, on the duties of the papacy.
But the period was not without its
trials. Envious detractors arose, and
charged him not only with being too
lenient in the government of Viterbo,
but also with favoring the modern
errors. It often happens that when
good men avoid severity, their clemency
is blamed; when they are gentle
and charitable toward heretics, their
orthodoxy is impugned.</p>

<p>There was near the lake Benacus,
(now Garda,) in the neighborhood of
Verona, a spot named Maguzano,
where stood, in Cardinal Pole's time, a
monastery of Benedictine monks. To
this retreat the cardinal turned when,
in 1553, he obtained the pope's consent
to resign his government of the
province of Viterbo. His duties as
governor had compelled him frequently
to visit Rome, and that city, which
should have been the abode of peace
and piety, was filled with tumult and
discord, in consequence of the dissensions
between Julius and Henry II. of
France. Many of the cardinal's dearest
friends were no more. Contarini, Bembo,
Sadolet, Cortesius, Badia, and
Giberti, Bishop of Verona, slept the
sleep of death, while Flaminius and
Victoria Colonna, Marchioness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Pescara, had also gone down to the
grave. Cardinal Pole, therefore, was
fain to retire beforehand from a transitory
world, and seek once more in
the shade of the cloister the peace
that passes all understanding and the
prospect of a heaven near at hand.</p>

<p>But it was with him as with so
many others who have betaken themselves
to a spiritual retreat, and bidden
farewell to the busy world at the
very moment when Providence intended
to call them into greater publicity
and more active service than
ever. Edward VI. died on the 6th
of July, 1553, the same day of the
same month on which his father had
stained his hands in the blood of Sir
Thomas More. The Princess Mary
ascended the throne. She was a zealous
Catholic, and if she had only understood
the temper of her subjects;
if she had not attempted to annihilate
a too powerful minority; if she
had been content to encourage the
ancient faith without persecuting the
adherents of the new religion; if she
had married an Englishman, or indeed
any one but a Spaniard, to whom,
on account of his nationality, her
people were unalterably averse, she
might have prolonged her life and
made her reign happy; she might
have been one of the greatest sovereigns
of her age; she might have
established Catholicity in England on
a permanent footing; she might have
bequeathed to her sister Elizabeth a
system of tolerant government, and
have taken it out of her power to
persecute Catholics in her turn, and
to supplant and vitiate entirely the
old religion of the land.</p>

<p>No time was lost by the holy father,
Julius III., in sending Cardinal
Pole to England as legate. Before
setting out on his journey, he entered
into correspondence with the queen, in
order to be certified of her good dispositions,
and received from her the
warmest assurances of welcome and
support.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> She was, in fact, in the early
part of her reign, too eager to announce
her future policy, and would have
done more wisely if she had followed
the counsel of the Emperor Charles
V., who warned her "not to declare
herself too openly while the issue of
affairs was yet uncertain." The successive
rebellions of Northumberland
in favor of Lady Jane Grey, and that
of Sir Thomas Wyatt, ought to have
made her be prudent, and avoid above
all things pressing matters to extremity.
She knew how deeply the nobles
and rich men of her realm were implicated
in the crime of sacrilege, and
how tenaciously they clung to the
spoils of abbeys and church lands of
which they had become possessed.
Scarcely a day passed without some
indication of the insecurity of her tenure
of power&mdash;without some warning
of the necessity of ruling with
impartiality and moderation.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Cardinal Pole was on his way to
England, when he dispatched from
the Tyrol two messengers, one to the
King of France, and the other to the
emperor, informing them of his instructions
to negotiate, if possible, a
peace between them in the name of
the pope. Charles V., however, was
by no means disposed to let Pole proceed
quietly on his journey. He was
bent on marrying his son Philip to
Mary, and he feared that the cardinal
might be either a rival of his son or
an adversary of the match. He refused,
therefore, to see the legate, stopped
him in the heart of Germany,
and caused him to return to Dillingen,
on the Danube. Here he received
instructions from Rome to wait
until circumstances should clear his
path; and here too he learned that
the articles of the queen's marriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>had been agreed to, and the rebellion
of Sir Thomas Wyatt suppressed. But
the chief obstacle to Pole's presence
in England being removed, the emperor
consented to receive him at
Brussels,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and Mary consulted him by
letter as to the bishops whom she
should appoint to fill the sees of those
whom she had removed. The new
prelates were carefully selected; and
when the Catholic religion was again
proscribed in the succeeding reign,
one of them only, Kitchin of Llandaff&mdash;the
calamity of his see&mdash;who had
changed with every change of the
court, abjured the faith of Christ and
adopted that of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Pole was still unable to obtain the
emperor's permission to cross over to
England, because the marriage of
Mary with Philip had not yet been
celebrated. The delay was truly afflictive
to the cardinal and the queen,
and the negotiations carried on by
Pole between the emperor and the
king of France produced little effect.
At last the emperor yielded to
Mary's entreaties; Pole's legatine powers,
though already very ample, were
enlarged; and he was permitted to
accept the invitation of the Lords
Paget and Hastings, with a train of
gentlemen, sent to Brussels for the
purpose of escorting him to his native
country. He was empowered to
reconcile England to the holy see on
such conditions as he should think
proper and feasible, particular faculties
being given to him to dispense
with the restitution of church property
and ecclesiastical revenues. His
agreeable manners and amiable address
pointed him out as the fittest
man in the world to execute so difficult
a commission; and the English
ambassador at Brussels, writing of him
to Mary, said,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"His conversation is much above that of
ordinary men, and adorned with such qualities
that I wish the man who likes him the
least in the kingdom were to converse with
him but one half-hour; it must be a stony
heart which he does not soften."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The bill required for the reversal
of Cardinal Pole's attainder was passed
in November, 1554. It stated
that the only reason for the attainder
had been the cardinal's refusal to consent
to the unlawful divorce of Queen
Mary's father and mother, and its repeal
restored him to all the rights
which he had forfeited through his
probity. The legate having taken
leave of the emperor, set out the next
day in princely style, accompanied by
one hundred and twenty horse. A
royal yacht and six men of war were
in readiness to receive him at Calais.
The wind itself was propitious to his
voyage, and, having been rough and
contrary for several days, suddenly
changed its direction, and wafted the
apostolic messenger safely to the British
shore.</p>

<p>The legate, when he landed at Dover,
was received and welcomed by
his nephew, Lord Montague. He
was treated as one of the royal family,
and on his arrival at Gravesend,
he was met by the Earl of Shrewsbury
and the Bishop of Durham.
They presented him with the act by
which his attainder was reversed; and
in his character as legate he proceeded
with them up the Thames in a
royal barge, at the head of which
shone conspicuously his silver cross.
Masses of spectators lined the banks,
and a large number of smaller barges
followed him up the river till he arrived
at Whitehall, then the residence
of the court. The chancellor with
many lords, the king, and the queen
with the ladies of her court, welcomed
him with affectionate joy. The
palace of Lambeth, which Cranmer
had exchanged for a prison, was richly
furnished for his use, and on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>morrow, the 28th of November, the
lords and commons assembled expressly
to hear from the legate's own lips
the object of his coming. The address
which he delivered was long
and impressive; it dwelt on the dismal
condition of nations cut off from
the unity of the church; and it set
forth the abundant blessings which
would follow from the purpose of the
holy see and the queen being accomplished
in the formal reconciliation
of England to the communion of the
Bishop of Rome. On the next day,
which was the feast of St. Andrew,
the parliament met again, together
with the king, the queen, and the legate.
The nation, like a scattered
and harried flock, was received once
more into the fold of the church by
general consent, amid deep emotion,
praises, and tears of joy. Yet many
who were present had misgivings
about the permanence and solidity of
the union thus affected. They remembered
the recent rebellion in favor
of Lady Jane Grey, the rising of
Sir Thomas Wyatt, the countenance
supposed to be given to the rebels by
the Princess Elizabeth, the extreme unpopularity
of the Spanish alliance, and
the haughty, violent character of Gardiner,
the chancellor, and of Bonner,
the Bishop of London.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Events unfortunately
justified these apprehensions,
and made the short reign of Mary,
for reasons which we shall presently
enumerate, a dismal failure and an instalment
of endless disaster.</p>

<p>The day after the reconciliation,
the lord mayor and other civic authorities
waited on the legate, and
requested him to honor the city with
a visit. Accordingly, on the first
Sunday in Advent he went by water
from Lambeth, landed at St. Paul's
wharf, and proceeded in great pomp
to the cathedral, where high mass
was celebrated in presence of their
majesties and the court. The sermon
was preached by Gardiner, the
Bishop of Winchester, who took occasion
to confess the share which he
had in the national guilt, and to implore
his hearers, who had been influenced
by him when he went astray,
to follow him now that he had recovered
the right path. It was certainly
asking a good deal, since Gardiner
himself had sat with Cranmer and
pronounced the sentence of divorce
between the king and Catharine. He
had also maintained the royal supremacy,
and sold his pen to Henry's
caprice.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The bill which was framed to effect
the restoration of the Catholic religion
in England was very comprehensive
and carefully worded. It
distinguished minutely between the
civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions,
and guarded against what legists are
accustomed to consider the encroachments
of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> It secured to
the owners of church lands the undisturbed
possession of their property
wherever it had been legally conveyanced;
and without this concession
the legate's mission would have proved
fruitless. It was followed by a
release of state prisoners, and by an
embassy being sent to the Roman
see. Before it had reached its destination,
Pope Julius III. died,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> after
a pontificate of five years. He was
succeeded by Marcellus, who reigned
only three weeks, and by his decease
opened the door for renewed exertions
to raise Cardinal Pole to the
papal chair. It was the third time
that Pole's friends had used all their
influence in his behalf. In the conclave
which elected Julius III., Cardinal
Farnese had nearly succeeded
in procuring his election; in the proceedings
which issued in the choice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>of Marcellus, the same cardinal had
obtained letters from the king of
France in Pole's favor; and now
again, when Caraffa was chosen and
took the name of Paul IV., it was not
the fault of Philip, Mary, or Gardiner
that the tiara did not light on
the head of Reginald Pole.</p>

<p>Having mediated a peace successfully
between France and the emperor,
Pole was appointed, by Philip's
special request, chief of the privy
council. He was to be absent from
the queen as little as possible, and
nothing of importance was to be
undertaken without his concurrence.
Pope Paul IV., however, did not look
favorably on Cardinal Pole, and had,
even at this time, some thought of
recalling him to Rome. Meanwhile
the legate with Gardiner made a
slight attempt to arouse the University
of Oxford from its lethargy in
respect to human learning, and a
short time afterward, before the end
of the year 1555, Gardiner being
dead, the cardinal convoked a national
synod to consider the disorders
of the period, and the best means of
stemming the torrent of depraved
morals and strange forms of unbelief.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to enter into
the history of the severe measures
which were adopted for the extirpation
of heresy in England, and which
we may, with the light which subsequent
events have cast upon them,
with reason suspect to have been
extreme and injudicious. We are
concerned only with the history of
Cardinal Pole, and every thing goes
to prove that he always preferred
lenient to severe measures, so far as
he considered it compatible with the
welfare of religion and the safety of
the throne. As for Cranmer, Latimer,
Ridley, and other principal personages
who were put to death, they
deserved their fate on account of the
numerous treasons and crimes which
they had committed, or to which they
had been accessory; and Elizabeth
herself might with perfect justice have
been brought to the block, from
which she was saved only by the
influence of Gardiner, for conspiring
against the crown of her sister. The
whole number of victims brought to
the scaffold was only from two to
four hundred, and numbers of those
who escaped into Ireland were sheltered
and concealed from legal pursuit
by the Irish Catholics, who have
suffered death by thousands for the
sake of religion, but have scarcely
ever inflicted it on others. The fanatics
and demagogues, who with
the cowardly and blood-thirsty instincts
of their species are seeking to
stir up the American people, "who
will not rise, in spite of their prayers
and their prophecies," against the
Irish Catholics of the United States,
will do well to remember this fact,
or rather, as such persons always forget
what does not suit their purpose,
the intelligent and honest citizens of
this republic will do well to remember
it, when these mischief-makers
attribute to their Catholic fellow-citizens
any ulterior design or hope of
ever seeking to propagate their religion
in this country by violent means.</p>

<p>As for Cardinal Pole himself, even
Mr. Froude acknowledges that he
was "not cruel." Burnet testifies
that he rescued the inhabitants of his
own district who were condemned to
death from the hand of Bonner.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
His secretary, Beccatelli, informs us
that "he used his best endeavors that
the sectaries might be treated with
lenity, and no capital punishment inflicted
on them;"<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and he himself declares
that he approved of putting
heretics to death only in extreme cases.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Rigorous and severe punishments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>upon all classes of offenders, coercive
measures and the stern exercise of authority
were, however, according to
the spirit of that age in every country,
and it is not strange that the milder
counsels of the gentle Pole were over-ruled,
and that he was unable to hinder
the executions desired by those
who had the supreme power of the
law in their hands. The administration
of Mary was severe and despotic.
Yet it is false to say that in her spirit
and intentions she was cruel or tyrannical.
What appears to us like an
unnecessary and even impolitic rigor
and vindictiveness against those who,
by the laws of England, were rebels
against both the civil and ecclesiastical
authorities of the realm, was to a
great extent due to the importunate
counsels of the lay-lords. Even Bonner
and Gardiner would gladly have
pursued a milder policy, and the majority
of the bishops and ecclesiastics,
notwithstanding the atrocious persecutions
to which they had been subjected
under Henry and Edward,
would have cordially sustained their
primate if he had been left free to exercise
his authority unimpeded by the
interference of the civil power. Yet,
though Mary's policy was severe, it
was mercy itself compared to that of
Henry, Elizabeth, and their Protestant
successors. It is not only an atrocious
calumny; it is a grim and dismal
jest for the panegyrists of Elizabeth,
and the exculpators of the hideous
massacres of Cromwell, to affix the
epithet of "bloody" to Queen Mary.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Moreover, it is not a mere question
of a greater or lesser amount of bloodshed
which should govern our award
of justice in respect to the two cases.
There is a difference of principle in
the case, which an impartial Jew, Mohammedan,
infidel, or even Protestant
can and ought to admit, as some
have admitted. Those persons who,
in England or elsewhere, have been
put to death by the civil power for
the crime of heresy under the Catholic
law, have been condemned for abjuring
that religion in which they had
been brought up, and which had been
part of the law of the land, as well as
the universal and traditional belief of
the nation, from the beginning of its
formation, or at least for centuries.
Even if the principles of law by which
they were condemned are pronounced
tyrannical and unjust, it is plain
that there is no parity between the
case of a ruler acting on such principles,
in common with other rulers of
the time and of past ages, and according
to maxims universally approved
by jurists and statesmen, and one who
compels his subjects to renounce their
ancient laws and religion, and to abjure
the faith in which they have been
educated, at his individual whim and
caprice. But although we are not disposed
to abandon Queen Mary to her
calumniators, we may give to Cardinal
Pole the high honor of having
been wiser than she was, or than her
other counsellors were, and of having
been in advance of the general spirit
of his age in regard to the wisest and
best method of treating religious errors,
which had taken too deep a root
to be summarily plucked up by a violent
effort; and with these few remarks
upon a topic which requires
much greater space for a satisfactory
discussion, we proceed with the personal
history of the cardinal.</p>

<p>After Cranmer's execution, Cardinal
Pole, who had hitherto been in
deacons' orders, was ordained priest,
consecrated bishop, and invested with
the pallium as Archbishop of Canterbury.
His works of piety were numerous;
he founded religious houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
preached, prayed, and watched for
souls in all respects as one that must
give account. He was made chancellor
of the University of Oxford, by
the resignation of Sir John Mason,
and chancellor of that of Cambridge
also, on the death of Gardiner.</p>

<p>To a sensitive mind there is no
greater anguish than that which springs
from the hostility of those whom it
has faithfully served. This suffering
it was Cardinal Pole's lot to incur.
His whole life had been devoted to
God, the church, and the holy see.
For these he had endured exile, persecution,
and the loss of all things.
For their sakes he had seen his mother
and his dearest relatives dragged
to the scaffold. In their cause he
had studied, written, toiled, prayed,
and wept till his hairs were gray. As
their defender and champion he had
been welcomed to England by his
cousin and sovereign, raised to the
head of the English church, and made
the chief instrument in bringing back
the ancient religion. But having
done so, having given every proof a
prelate could give of his devoted attachment
to his religion, having twice
been on the very steps of the papal
throne, with what agony must his
spirit have been tortured when he
found, as he did find, that he was in
disfavor with Paul IV.; that he was
superseded as legate; that he was recalled
to Rome; and that, to crown
the cup of bitterness, he and his friend,
Cardinal Morone, were to answer to
a charge of heterodoxy before the Inquisition.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Does Almighty God, therefore," he
wrote to the pontiff,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> "require that a parent
should slay his child? Once, indeed,
he gave this precept when he commanded
Abraham to offer in sacrifice his son Isaac,
whom he tenderly loved, and through whom
all the promises made to the father were to
be accomplished. And what are now the
preparations your holiness is making but so
many forerunners of the sacrifice of my better
life, that is, of my reputation? For in
how wretched a sense must that pastor be
said to live who has lost with his flock the
credit of an upright belief?... Is this
sword of anguish, with which you are about
to pierce my soul, the return I am to receive
for all my services?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Happily for the cardinal, Mary and
Philip took his part. They remonstrated
with the pope on the loss
which they and their subjects would
sustain if Pole were recalled, and they
prevailed with the holy father so far
that he consented to the cardinal's
retaining the see of Canterbury, while
he appointed Peto, the Greenwich
friar, to supersede him as legate.
Quite in the spirit of her father, Mary
caused the nuncio who brought this
decision to England to be arrested,
and interdicted Peto from accepting
the legatine office. He never received
any official notice of his appointment,
nor Pole of the papal decision.
He was, however, too loyal a subject
of the pope to avail himself of this
regal interference. He ceased to act
as legate, and sent his chancellor to
Rome with entreaties and protests.
Again the pope required that Pole
should appear in Rome to clear himself
from the charge of heresy; and
Peto was summoned there also to assist
the pontiff with his advice. Proceedings
against the English cardinal
were already commenced, and the
distressing state of things was set at
rest only by the death of some of the
principal actors. Peto, the rival legate,
died, and while the affair was
still in suspense the grave closed over
the disappointed, despairing queen,
and the broken-hearted<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> cardinal.
He was attacked by a quartan ague,
and, feeling conscious of his approaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>end, he made a will, in which he
protested his attachment to the Church
of Rome and especially to Pope Paul
IV., from whom he had experienced
treatment which seemed equally inexplicable
and unkind. His last hours
were passed in acts of devotion, and
it was probably with supreme satisfaction
that he laid his aching head
on the pillow of death on the morning
of the 18th of November, 1558.
His friend, cousin, and sovereign had
preceded him in the dark valley by
only twenty-two hours, and he felt,
no doubt, that his most powerful if
not his best friend was no more. Elizabeth
was already queen, and her Protestant
tendencies were well known.
There was every reason to suspect
that she would reverse the religious
system restored by her sister, and
take advantage of the general unpopularity
which Mary by her severity
had incurred. There was one object
only for which Cardinal Pole could
reasonably wish to prolong his life,
and that was to clear himself from
the extraordinary charge which had
been brought against him by calumniators.
But it was the will of Providence
that his fair and unspotted
fame should be vindicated only after
his death.</p>

<p>During forty days the palace at
Lambeth was hung with black. An
altar was placed in the apartment of
the deceased cardinal, and masses were
said constantly for the repose of his
soul. His body was then conveyed
to Canterbury with great pomp, and
his funeral was followed by large numbers
of citizens and clergy. The exalted
rank of Cardinal Pole, the important
part he had played in the history of his
time, and the high offices he had filled
made him an object of reverence to
the multitude, who knew not, and did
not even suspect, the intrigues of which
he was the victim and the humiliating
charge under which he lay.</p>

<p>We shall not endeavor in this place
to follow the example of his indiscriminating
panegyrists. Suffice it to
say that he was a devoted son of the
church, and that he did all in his power
to resist the impious will of the
tyrant with whom Providence had
brought him face to face. His zeal for
the conversion of England was laudable,
though not crowned with the success
which it deserved.</p>

<p>In his youth he had written a commentary
on Cicero's works; but this
was never printed, and the manuscript
was lost. He excelled in exposition
of the Scriptures, which were his constant
study and delight. "His character,"
Mr. Froude allows, "was irreproachable;
in all the virtues of the
Catholic Church he walked without
spot or stain."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> He was honored
with the friendship of men of great
distinction, such as Sir Thomas More,
Erasmus, Sadolet, Bishop of Carpentras,
Bembo, Friuli, Paul III., and
Ignatius Loyola. His forgiving disposition
may be gathered from the
fact that when three English ruffians
came to Capranica to murder him,
were arrested on suspicion, and confessed
that they were emissaries of
Henry VIII., he would only allow
them to be condemned to the galleys
for a few days. His clemency,
as we have seen, in a relentless age,
caused him to be suspected; and we
have the testimony of Bishop Burnet,
the Protestant historian of the Reformation,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
to assure us that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"such qualities and such a temper as his,
could he have brought others into the same
measures, would probably have gone far toward
bringing back this nation to the Church
of Rome; as he was a man of as great probity
and virtue as any of the age he lived in."</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE YOUNG VERMONTERS.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

DUTY AND TEMPTATION.</h3>

<p>"Hollo! George and Henry,
where are you going in such a hurry?
Can't you stop to speak to a fellow?"
cried Frank Blair to his two
school-mates, George Wingate and
Henry Howe, whom he was trying
to overtake in their walk on a fine
afternoon in June.</p>

<p>"Yes," said George. "We can
stop to speak, but not to stay long,
for we are on our way to the church."</p>

<p>"What are you going to church
for? You'd better come with me; for
I can tell you there's lots of fun going
on that you'll be sorry to lose!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" eagerly inquired
Henry.</p>

<p>"Oh! I can't tell you unless you
join us; all the fellows have agreed
not to tell any thing about it, only to
those who promise beforehand to go
in and keep the whole secret."</p>

<p>"Ah! then," said George, "we
could not agree to any such thing;
for it would be wrong for us to make
a promise like that beforehand. So
we couldn't go with you, if we were
not bound for the church."</p>

<p>"Why are you bound for church
on a week-day?"</p>

<p>"Because," answered George, "to-morrow
will be a festival, and we are
going to help prepare the church, and
then prepare ourselves for celebrating
it."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare! I never did see
any thing like you Catholic boys!
You're a real puzzle to me; as pious
as deacons, and take to religion as
naturally as a duck does to water, and
yet I know you love fun just as well
as any of us. What are you going
to do to prepare for this festival?"</p>

<p>"Oh! we shall help the sacristan,
who is an infirm old man, to make
the church neat and tidy, in the first
place. Then we shall assist in getting
evergreens ready for the decoration;
and we expect our mothers
and sisters with flowers to be arranged
in vases for the altar, while we
are twining and putting up wreaths.
We hope to make the church very
beautiful for the great feast of the
Blessed Sacrament. After we get
this all done, we shall prepare for
holy communion, which we hope to
receive to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And how do you prepare for
that?"</p>

<p>"First of all, we make our examination
of conscience, and say our
prayers in preparation for confession."</p>

<p>"You go to confession! Why, I
thought none but sinners confessed
to the priest."</p>

<p>"And don't you think we are sinners?"
said George.</p>

<p>"Of course not! How can we boys
be sinners? I never thought of such
a thing. I don't believe I'm a sinner
at all! I only love a frolic once
in a while; and I hate religion, because
it's such a gloomy kind of business.
So you think you won't join
us, eh?"</p>

<p>"No; we have other matters to attend
to."</p>

<p>"Well, then, good-by; but you'll
be sorry you didn't go with us, I can
tell you!"</p>

<p>He left them, and the two boys
walked on in silence for some time.
At length Henry said with a sigh,</p>

<p>"Don't you wish we could have
gone with them, George? I'll warrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
you there's some grand fun up.
I wonder what it is?"</p>

<p>"No matter what it is, Henry. We
have only to do what is right, and
what we know we ought to do first,
and then we shall find ways enough
to enjoy ourselves; and have more
enjoyment, too, than we should if we
neglected duty for pleasure."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," said
Henry sadly; "but I can't help thinking
there's more sport in going off
with a lot of boys for a frolic than
there is in being good, and helping
the women fix up the church. It
don't seem to me like boys' work,
to be fussing with wreaths and bouquets."</p>

<p>"Ah my fine fellow! you are really
getting very smart. What do you
think of our fathers, and of Mr.
A&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, two of the
most active business men in the
place&mdash;and yet they take as much
interest in having the church made
beautiful for the divine offices as the
women do. Don't you remember
how Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;, when he couldn't
leave court during the trial of an important
case, sent one of his students,
and his man with a ladder, to help
put up the wreaths last Christmas?
Mighty smart for us boys to think it is
too small business for us, to be sure!
Then, as to the fun, we'll wait and
see how the boys come out with their
frolic. I have my own notion that
there'll be more mischief than sport,
and that we may hereafter be glad
we had no part in it. Frank Blair is
a pleasant, good-natured fellow; but
he is a reckless chap too. He had
learned a great many city tricks before
they came here to live, and will
do any thing for fun, without thinking
of the consequences. Any way, we
know there's nothing like duty first
and play afterwards to make boys
happy."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

RURAL PLEASURES.</h3>

<p>The church was situated in the
very shadow of a wood that skirts
the pretty village of M&mdash;&mdash;, in northern
Vermont. When the two boys
reached it, they found quite an assemblage
of their school-fellows awaiting
the arrival of the sacristan, who
soon appeared, and sent some into
the woods with axes and hatchets to
cut the evergreens, dispatched others
with pails for water, and kept George
and Henry to help him in the church.</p>

<p>They had just finished arranging
all in order and dusting the sanctuary,
when their mothers and sisters
arrived with the flowers, which they
took to a little room adjoining the
sacristy, where the pails of water were
left. Very soon some of the boys came
in with the evergreen trees; the beautiful
trailing pines of several varieties,
and graceful feathery foliage of
brilliant green, together with a profusion
of other wild-wood treasures,
which they had collected. The village
girls also came bringing wild
flowers and other contributions for the
decoration.</p>

<p>Young Catholics in country places
need not be told how pleasantly the
time passed with this company in the
varied occupations of tying wreaths,
arranging bouquets in the vases, putting
up the festooned garlands, winding
the pillars, and executing other
devices, with which they are already
so familiar as to need no information.
But it is certain that the young people
of cities, losing all these true and
natural enjoyments, as well as the
developments of taste and ingenuity
to which they lead, lose a valuable
aid to devotion. They who cannot
participate in the adornment of the
material temple for the worship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
God, by bringing the simple offerings
of the woodlands and the valleys for
its embellishment, lose a very important
incentive to the due preparation
of the spiritual temple for his reception.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of the priest, the
work of decoration was completed,
and each pious heart was gladdened
to see how beautiful the altar
looked, smiling through a profusion
of flowers, whose fragrance hovered
around the tabernacle of the Lord
like a breath from paradise, and embowered
in wreaths prepared from
the "glory of Libanus," together
with tributes from "the fir-tree, the
box-tree, and the pine," which youthful
hands had collected to "beautify
the place of his sanctuary, and to
make the place of his feet glorious."</p>

<p>When all was finished, the cheerful
crowd quietly sought their places
in the church, to prepare for the holy
sacrament of reconciliation.</p>

<p>While these busy performances
were in progress, George had looked
in vain among the young people assembled
to discover two lads who
were near his own age, and in whom
he felt a special interest&mdash;Michael
Hennessy and Dennis Sullivan. He
feared they had been drawn away
into the expedition of their school-mates
mentioned by Frank Blair.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the
priest announced during the mass
that there would be no vespers that
afternoon, as he was going to visit
another parish. After mass, Mr.
Wingate and Mr. Howe told George
and Henry that they intended taking
the two families out to Mr.
Howe's farm, a few miles distant, that
afternoon, and that they might invite
some of their young friends to accompany
them. They were delighted;
for there was nothing they enjoyed
so much as their occasional
visits to the farm. So they sought
among the crowd at the church door
their friends Mike and Dennis; but
they were not to be found. They
invited Patrick Casey, and a few
other boys, to come to their homes
after dinner and join the excursion.</p>

<p>Soon after dinner the large family
carriages were brought up, and such
a bustle ensued, stowing away in the
vehicles baskets filled with buttered
biscuits, cold ham and tongue, sandwiches,
cakes, and sundry other delicacies,
with a package of table-cloths
and napkins, as betokened a grand
supper in the woods, which was of all
things the most delightful to the boys.</p>

<p>The party were soon comfortably
packed into the capacious carriages,
and set off in high glee. When they
arrived at the farm-house, Mrs. Howe
made arrangements for a plentiful
supply of milk, fresh strawberries and
cream, and other things, to be taken
to a certain place in the woods at a
time appointed, and the merry company
set out in quest of the quiet
nooks and shady dells of the forest.</p>

<p>There was no end to the pleasant
incidents that here met our young
people at every turn. They had
scarcely entered the shadowy domain,
when a partridge whirred up
from their very feet into a tree over
their heads, and they soon discovered
she had left a brood of her young
below. Such a scramble as took
place in pursuit of the shy little beauties!&mdash;the
girls holding their aprons,
that the captives might be deposited
in them as fast as caught. It was
funny to see how the wise little creatures
would hide under every chip,
bit of bark, or dead leaf, and, when
these were lifted, how still they would
lie, as if lifeless&mdash;so near the color of
the ground that it was hard to distinguish
them&mdash;and allow themselves to
be taken.</p>

<p>After sufficiently admiring their
tiny prisoners, they set them at liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and resumed their exploration
of the forest. Very soon one of them
came across a night-hawk's nest on
the ground, and called all the party
to admire it, with its treasure of curious
brown eggs. Then they discovered
a blue-bird's nest built with
rare skill in a hole in the trunk of a
tree. And now a splendid gray squirrel
attracted their attention; he ran
up a tree and out to the end of a
limb, where he sat calmly defying all
their efforts to frighten or knock him
off. A discussion upon squirrels and
their habits ensued, and "Grandma"
Howe told them she once saw a large
gray squirrel by a small sheet of water,
where a dashing mountain brook
had subsided into a quiet basin, which
he wanted to cross. He stood on
the margin for some time, as if considering
the matter&mdash;turning himself
to ascertain the direction of the wind,
which happened to be favorable&mdash;then,
seizing a chip that lay near him,
threw it into the water, and springing
aboard of his little craft, raised his
tail to catch the wind, and sailed
across swiftly and safely. When he
gained the other shore, he jumped off,
and did not even have the politeness
to pull his boat ashore after him.</p>

<p>All this time Mr. Squirrel sat eying
his guests of "the green-wood" very
composedly, occasionally stamping his
little foot with pretty pettishness, and
at length fell to nibbling a last year's
beech-nut which he had carried up
to his perch for a lunch with so
much coolness that his young observers
were quite charmed, and determined
to leave him to munch his nut
in peace. They now sought a bright
little brook that danced gayly over
shining pebbles near by, and the murmur
of whose waters, mingling with
the rustle of leaves stirred by the
breath of June, whispered in sweet
harmony the song of the woods.
They soon reached a fringe of graceful
willows marking its course, and
dipping their pendent limbs to kiss
the crystal flood.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Howe overtook the
party and called out, "Boys, who
would like to try some trout-fishing
in the brook?"</p>

<p>Of course the boys were all eager
for the sport; but where was the necessary
fishing-tackle?</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Howe, "you see I
have provided for that," producing a
case filled with jointed rods, flies, lines,
and all needful appliances for trout-fishing.</p>

<p>Each boy was soon supplied, and
started off in search of the deep pools
and sequestered waters favorable for
their sport; while the girls rambled
on, delighting themselves with the
beautiful June flowers, peeping into
each shaded recess for the modest feathered
orchis&mdash;queen of its tribe, and
most fragrant flower of the woods&mdash;and
exploring the more open spaces near
the brook, for the several varieties of
elegant and fantastic "ladies' slippers,"
which abound in the woodlands of
northern Vermont. Then the splendid
lichens and ferns attracted their
admiring notice; and before the hour
for their repast arrived, they had accumulated
a wealth of sylvan treasures
wherewith to embellish their homes,
and keep alive pleasant recollections
of their brief sojourn in those woody
solitudes.</p>

<p>At length an envoy from the farm-house
arrived laden with refreshments&mdash;cards
of pure white honey-comb
filled with transparent sweets,
cream of the richest, field strawberries
in profusion, and milk fresh and abundant
The girls soon spread the snow-white
cloths on the turf at the foot of
an ancient oak by the brook-side, and,
under the direction of the elder ladies,
emptied the baskets and prepared
an ambrosial banquet, while Mr. Wingate
called in the stragglers, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
young fishers of the party, to partake
of it. They were reluctant to leave
sports which they were enjoying so
much, and saw the day drawing to a
close with regret. Each boy brought
a fine string of trout for the Friday
morning's breakfast, and appetites
sharpened by their green wood scramble
to the luxurious and plentiful repast.</p>

<p>At the close of their meal they prepared
to return, and were soon on
their homeward course; the young
people all declaring that they had never
passed an afternoon more delightful.
George and Henry were very
sure, as they remarked to each other,
that Frank Blair and his companions
could not have had so pleasant
a time on their frolic of the evening
before.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

THE TEMPTER AND HIS VICTIMS.</h3>

<p>On the eve of the festival, as Frank
Blair was sauntering down the street,
after he had left George and Henry,
he met Michael Hennessy and Dennis
Sullivan.</p>

<p>"Hurrah boys! you're the very
chaps I wanted to find," said he. "I
say, don't you want to go in with a lot
of us for a real tip-top time?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" they both inquired
eagerly, when Frank said something
in a low voice, to which they responded,
"Yes, yes! we promise;" and he
went on in the same tone to explain
the plan.</p>

<p>"But we can't," said Michael; "our
pockets are as empty as a last year's
bird's nest, and this requires money."</p>

<p>"Oh! never mind that," was Frank's
reply, "I'll plank the tin;" which announcement
was met by a merry shout
and, "We'll go!" from them both.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Frank, "meet us
at the depot within the hour," and
passed on.</p>

<p>Now these boys had been on their
way to the church; but after they parted
with Frank, they turned their course
toward the depot. As they were walking
silently and leisurely along in that
direction, Dennis spoke:</p>

<p>"I say, Mike, it seems to me that
this is not just the right thing we are
doing; our mothers think we are at
the church, and I'm afraid no good
will come of our turning away in this
fashion."</p>

<p>"O you fool!" said Mike, "they'll
never know but we are at the church,
and fun's better than religion any day.
I hate such humdrum ways, going
along every day alike, and never a
scrape of any sort; and so do all the
boys."</p>

<p>"Not all of them; for there's George
Wingate loves fun as well as any of
us, and a grand hand to help it on too;
but he never leaves better things for
it," said Dennis sadly.</p>

<p>"George <em>is</em> a regular brick and no
mistake. He takes to fun and religion,
each in its own time, as if there were
nothing else in the world; but we can't
all be like him, and there's no use in
trying. I warrant you now that, if
he could only have the chance, there's
Henry Howe would a great sight rather
pitch in for fun in a scrape like
this, than go George's roads."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he would," and Dennis
paused a moment sighing; "but I'm
afraid it isn't right, especially for catholic
boys. It's a poor preparation
for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! boys can't be saints.
We'll leave that to our mothers, they
can say prayers enough for us and
themselves too; so we may enjoy ourselves
while we can. But I wonder
where Frank gets all his money; his
father is a stingy old curmudgeon,
they say, and I don't understand it."</p>

<p>"Don't you know that his father's
maiden sister, who lives with him, is
rich, and she fills Frank's pockets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
He told me so. He said that when
he could get his father's permission,
as he did to go to these shows this
afternoon, his aunt furnished all the
money he wanted."</p>

<p>In this way they chatted until they
reached the depot, where a multitude
of wildly excited boys soon absorbed
their attention, and drowned the whispers
of conscience for poor Dennis.</p>

<p>Meantime, as Frank was on his
way home to replenish his purse for
the evening, he met Patrick Casey
and Johnny Hart, and accosted them
much as he had Michael and Dennis.
They objected that they were going
to the church and could not join his
party.</p>

<p>"O fol-de-rol!" said he; "there'll
be chances enough to go to church,
but you won't often have such a
chance as this for a frolic. Mike
Hennessy and Dennis Sullivan are
going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are they?" eagerly exclaimed
Johnny. "Then I'll go too. Won't
you, Pat?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't!" said Pat resolutely.
"If Mike and Dennis choose
to do wrong, is that any reason why
we should? Come along Johnny, and
don't be a fool!"</p>

<p>Johnny hesitated as Patrick passed
on, and Frank said the fools were
those who'd lose all the sport for the
sake of being as dull as beetles, and
making old women of themselves;
adding,</p>

<p>"There'll be time enough to be
pious after you have done being jolly!"</p>

<p>This artful speech decided poor
Johnny, who turned and went to the
depot.</p>

<p>But why did Frank Blair say nothing
of those who refused to go,
while he baited his snare with the
names of those who consented? It
was because boys understand fully
the force of <em>example</em>, and can wield
it with great power to secure their
ends. When we consent to act contrary
to the still small voice of conscience,
we never know how far the
consequences of that act may extend.
Evil examples attract more imitators
than good ones&mdash;but woe to him who
furnishes them; while firm adherence
to the right may win some wavering
soul to the path of duty, which will
shine as one of the brightest jewels
in our crown of rejoicing hereafter!</p>

<p>Johnny had hardly reached the depot
before Frank arrived, and presently
a train of cars came thundering up,
the boys hastening to secure seats for
the little village of H&mdash;&mdash;, a short
distance from M&mdash;&mdash;, where they soon
arrived, and upon leaving the cars
found a great crowd gathered around
an immense tent, awaiting the opening
of the exhibition. This was announced
in astounding illustrated
hand-bills as the most remarkable
one ever witnessed, embracing more
unheard-of enormities in the brute
creation, and wonders of the human
race, than were ever before congregated
in one assemblage.</p>

<p>When the tent was opened, the rush
that ensued baffles description; during
the progress of which Mike's elbows
came in closer contact with the
ribs of a boy near him than was at
all comfortable, while Dennis Sullivan's
fist went very innocently into
the face of a lad who was pushing
his way more sharply than was agreeable
to his neighbors, leaving, in its
unconscious energy, a "black eye"
in his visage.</p>

<p>While the crowd was slowly entering
the tent, the boys from M&mdash;&mdash; indulged
themselves in dealing out a
series of these little jokes, more to
their own satisfaction than to that
of the recipients. At length it was
suspected they were not wholly accidental
or unintentional, when a general
row ensued, and cries of "Hustle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
them out!" "Give them fits!" "Pitch
into the boys from M&mdash;&mdash;!" were
wildly shouted from all sides. Our
heroes stood their ground with a coolness
worthy of a better cause, giving
as many hard blows as they received
and shouting, "Don't you H&mdash;&mdash;
boys want to come to M&mdash;&mdash; to see
the elephant again? Don't you
wish you could, now? We'll show
you we know how to return small
compliments, we will!"</p>

<p>In truth, as it turned out, the M&mdash;&mdash;
boys were in so much "better training,"
as the pugilists say, that those
of H&mdash;&mdash; were in a fair way to get
soundly pommelled, when some men
interfered to stop the fight and inquire
the cause. Frank spoke for his party.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, these youngsters
came to M&mdash;&mdash; the last time we had
a menagerie and circus there, and behaved
themselves so outrageously
that a company of us determined we
would pay them the first chance we
had. And I think we have; grand
fun it has been too!"</p>

<p>"Precious fun it <em>must</em> have been!"
said a plain, farmer-like man; "and
a beautiful pack you've made of one
another out and out! Torn clothes,
broken shins, bleeding noses, black
eyes, and more bumps on your tarnal
heads than the old frenologer feller
that goes round lectering with a skull
ever thought of! A pretty lookin' set
of picters you are, an't you?"</p>

<p>"You bet!" said Frank; then
turning to his companions, "but boys,
I say, didn't we pepper them, though?
I don't believe they'll want to come
to M&mdash;&mdash; the next show-day. If they
do, we'll be ready for them, eh, boys?"</p>

<p>A wild hurrah was the reply, and
they sought a neighboring brook to
wash off such traces of the conflict
as water could efface. At Frank's
invitation they then gathered around
a booth where pies, cakes, gingerbread,
lemonade, candies, and a variety
of other delicacies were dispensed,
where they refreshed themselves
heartily after their exertions.</p>

<p>Before they had concluded their
repast, the crowd had all disappeared
within the capacious tent, and the
shadows of evening were gathering
fast. Not caring to go in directly,
our young adventurers amused themselves
by performing numerous pranks
in which mischief was more conspicuous
than sense or wit.</p>

<p>A young lawyer of the place, being
quite devoted in his attentions to the
merchant's daughter, they took the
sign from his office and placed it on
the front door of the merchant's residence.
They removed a sign from
one of the shops, on which was marked,
"Codfish, salt and fresh; herrings,
pickled and smoked; Boston
cured hams&mdash;for sale here. N.B.
Deacon's skins taken in exchange,"<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
and fastened it over the "meeting-house"
door, writing under it with
chalk, in large letters, "Inquire within."</p>

<p>Seeing a donkey quietly munching
his nettles in a corner of the village
green, they captured him, and with
great exertion succeeded in imprisoning
him within a back shed attached
to a cottage where a maiden lady resided
alone. When they tired of these
and similar foolish exploits, too numerous
to mention, they entered the
tent. Unfortunately, their mischievous
propensities entered with them.
Frank soon began to amuse himself
by tweaking the whiskers of a peevish
old monkey, which forthwith sprang
to the top of his head, and, holding
on by his hair, planted its teeth so
firmly in his ear that the young gentleman
was fain to cry out for the
keeper. At the same moment, Dennis
had placed a piece of tobacco on
the extremity of the elephant's trunk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>and not dodging instantly, as he intended,
was seized by the enraged
animal and tossed to the top of the
tent, coming down upon the bald
head of an elderly gentleman, who,
catching him with one hand, shook
him until his teeth chattered, at the
same time administering telling blows
with the disengaged hand upon the
sorely bruised urchin within his grasp.</p>

<p>While this was going on in one
part of the tent, another of the enterprising
company had ventured to
cross the forbidden inclosure before
the lion's cage, and was glad to escape
from the claws of the animal
with a coat badly torn, and scratches
upon his face which he carried for
many a day.</p>

<p>After a series of similar mishaps,
the party took the down-train for
home, each bearing unmistakable
marks of the <em>fun</em>, and protesting they
never before had such a "tip-top
time," though Frank's misgivings
found utterance in a low voice to
Mike,</p>

<p>"My father's awfully severe, and I
don't know what the old trump will
say to all this when he hears of it;
but it can't be helped now!"</p>

<p>He was not the only one of the
company who was haunted by secret
fears as to how the proofs of the affray,
which each one carried on his
person, would be regarded by their
home circles.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

THE CONSEQUENCES.</h3>

<p>Very quietly did the party of young
pleasure-seekers retire to their beds,
after they arrived at their homes that
evening, fatigued and exhausted with
the excitement of the past few hours.
Nor were they in any haste to make
themselves visible on the following
morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sullivan called Dennis early
to bring some water and assist her,
that they might go to church in good
season; but her calls were unheeded.
So she sought his room, exclaiming,
"Why, what ails you, Dinnie, my boy,
that you cannot awaken for my calling?"</p>

<p>The mother's eye was quick to detect
that something was wrong the
moment it rested on the countenance
of her hopeful son, and she added,</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, Dinnie, darling,
what has happened you, any
how?"</p>

<p>Dennis made an awkward and blundering
apology which entirely failed
to satisfy his mother, who soon drew
the whole story from him.</p>

<p>"It's all along of that dirty Frank
Blair!" said she. "I wish to goodness
he was across the sea, with his rogue's
tricks and monkey pranks! It's no
use trying to rear Catholic children
to respect their religion, and attend
to their duties, among these Yankees!
They'd entice the very priest
at the altar! A pretty shindy you've
cut up now! But get up, and let us
see how you are entirely."</p>

<p>Poor Dennis attempted to obey;
but his head ached so cruelly, he was
so lame and bruised and sore, that
he became faint the moment he tried
to sit up; and one of his eyes was
swollen to such a degree that he could
not open it.</p>

<p>"Bad luck to the mischief of these
boys!" said his mother. "I see he'll
never be able to go with me to church
this day; so he may as well keep to
his bed."</p>

<p>Glad enough was Dennis to creep
back to his nest.</p>

<p>Mike Hennessy and Johnny Hart
were not in so bad a plight, but they
were unable to go to church.</p>

<p>As the boys were lying through the
long hours oppressed with the languor
that follows such wild excitement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
with aching bones, their reflections
upon the frolic and its consequences
were by no means consoling. Nor
did the comparisons they drew between
the lawful sports of the play-ground
and the reckless turbulence
of "<i>tip-top times</i>" fail to decide the
question in favor of the more quiet
enjoyments.</p>

<p>Was it a pale phantom that sat
by the bedside of each during those
hours&mdash;while the joyful bells of the
great feast were sending forth their
jubilant peals&mdash;and searching his very
soul with reproachful eyes pointed an
uplifted finger from the painful realities
of the <em>now</em> to the calm vision of
what <em>might have been</em>, had he followed
the voice of conscience and the
requirements of duty, until he shrunk
affrighted from the picture? Ah! no,
my boys; it was no phantom; it was
the only <em>reality</em> in the sight of which
these mortal frames of ours subside
to dust, and in comparison with the
permanence of which they become&mdash;with
all their importunate sensibilities,
their worldly ambitions, their earthly
cravings, and their fleeting pleasures&mdash;but
the "baseless fabrics of a dream!"
It was the tender, vigilant, and ever-present
friend of the sinner; his best
friend, his other self&mdash;his conscience!
destined to be the crowning joy of
his home in heaven, or to be exchanged
at the portals of death for remorse,
the gnawing "worm that never dies,"
in the regions of "eternal despair"!
Woe to that boy who sins, and who
fails to receive, in his first solitary
hours, a visit from the reproving monitor,
or to profit by its awakening
and warning voice!</p>

<p>The next morning they were so
much better that they could go to
school, and meeting George Wingate
in the yard, he exclaimed, "Why,
boys, where were you yesterday, that
you did not come to church? Henry
and I looked for you through the
whole crowd, to invite you to go with
us to the farm. Pat Casey went, and
we had the best kind of a time; we
were so sorry you were not with
us!"</p>

<p>They replied that they were not
well, and had to stay at home.
George noticed their embarrassment,
and that the face of Dennis betrayed
bruises about the eye, while Mike's
forehead and Johnny's nose displayed
traces of a similar nature, and he
conjectured the cause of their absence
from church.</p>

<p>After school, as he and Henry were
walking home, Henry remarked, "I
suspect, George, that wherever the
boys went that afternoon, they had a
rousing fight, for ever so many of them
show the marks of it. I heard a man
telling that there was a great row
among the boys at the show in H&mdash;&mdash;
that night; and I shouldn't wonder if
our fellows were among them."</p>

<p>"We need not trouble ourselves
about it," George replied; "but I
thought at the time it was very likely
we might be thankful we were called
another way, and had nothing to do
with their frolic. I've noticed that
when boys go off by themselves in
pursuit of fun, they seldom come out
the better for it; and as for enjoyment,
there is just none at all. I
wouldn't give one hour of such pleasure
as we found in the woods for the
wildest frolic they can get up."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," said Henry; "I'm
determined I won't have any part in
their scrapes hereafter. If no other
trouble followed, the shame of going
to confession after a wild row is
enough to destroy all the pleasure."</p>

<p>"Yes," George rejoined; "and I
don't see how our boys who mean to
go regularly to their confession can
join heartily in these mad pranks.
As for those who have no such intention,
why, the less we have to do with
them the better."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

AN OUTSIDE GLIMPSE.</h3>

<p>As Frank Blair had expected, his
father was very much offended at
the share he had taken in the performances
at H&mdash;&mdash;, and the assault
upon the boys, of which he was informed
the next morning by a man
from H&mdash;&mdash;, who told him all about
the fright, and the tricks that had
been played at that place: also, that
the maiden lady, Miss Merton, whose
bedroom happened to be in a part of
the house adjoining the shed where
the donkey was imprisoned, had
been frightened almost to death by
the braying of the animal in the
night. Under the firm impression
that the lion had escaped and
was attacking her house, she rushed
out in her night-dress, and, espying a
light in a small shop near by, broke
in upon three little French shoemakers,
who were sitting up to finish
some job-work that must be ready
for morning. Now, one of these had
been whiling away the time by stories
of a ghost in a Canadian village, that
had visited several families, and could
assume the guise of different persons,
living and dead. He was just reciting
one of the most harrowing of
these incidents when the sudden apparition
of the lady in a long white
dress, with a face of ghastly pallor,
and eyes distended with affright, burst
upon their astounded vision! Not
for a moment doubting its unearthly
nature, one of them jumped through
an open window, another sprung up
a ladder and out upon the roof, while
the third took refuge under a dry-goods
box in the cellar.</p>

<p>The unfortunate lady, thinking that
the lion was in close pursuit, and that
a glimpse of it through the open door
had caused the sudden stampede of
the shoemakers, dared not turn back;
but betook herself to screaming at the
top of her voice, in which she was
joined by the affrighted sons of Crispin
in so vigorous a chorus that the
whole village was soon aroused.</p>

<p>When the cause of all the disturbance
was revealed, and the harmless
animal released from captivity, it was
almost impossible to persuade the
lady that her life was not in danger;
and there was such serious question
of sending to M&mdash;&mdash; and arresting
the juvenile offenders, that Mr. Blair
was advised to go immediately to
H&mdash;&mdash; and settle the matter.</p>

<p>As for the shoemakers, we may be
permitted to add&mdash;somewhat in advance
of our story&mdash;the fact that their
terrified imaginations had so far misled
their reason that they could never
again be persuaded to work in the
shop after night-fall, or be led to believe
fully in the identity of Miss Merton
with their ghastly midnight visitant.</p>

<p>The man who communicated these
details gave Mr. Blair the names of
all the boys of the party whom he
knew, among them those of Michael,
Dennis, and Johnny.</p>

<p>"Those pestilent Irish boys!" Mr.
Blair exclaimed indignantly. "They
are always drawing our Yankee boys
into fights and mischief! Some measures
ought to be taken to make examples
of them, and prevent these
outbreaks."</p>

<p>He intimated the same to Frank
that day while lecturing him severely
for "following such ringleaders" into
disgraceful riots. Frank had too much
honor to permit his father to remain
in this error, and protested stoutly
that it was himself who persuaded
them into it; but it was evident
enough that he failed to convince his
father of that fact. Mr. Blair was
not an ill-natured man, and did not
intend to be unjust; but he unfortunately
indulged the prejudices against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
foreigners into which too many Americans
fall without pausing to examine
whether they are just. They take a
few bad specimens upon which to
found a sweeping sentence against
the whole class, not reflecting that the
vices of the wicked serve to render
them conspicuous, while the modest
virtues of the good only withdraw
them from public notice.</p>

<p>After he had given Frank a very
stern admonition, Mr. Blair proceeded
to inform him that a certain fowling-piece
which had long been the
object of his most ardent desire, and
of which he had hoped to gain possession
before the Fourth of July,
would not now be purchased for him,
on account of his misconduct; and
that immediate steps would be taken
to secure a place for him in the naval
school at A&mdash;&mdash;, in the fall.</p>

<p>These were severe blows to Frank.
The disappointment of his cherished
hopes in connection with the much-coveted
fowling-piece, and his dread
of the naval school, where he knew
the discipline was so strict as to prevent
the possibility of mischief, combined
to make him take a very desponding
view of life in general, and
of what he regarded as the bondage
to "old fogyism," in particular. He
resolved, however, to behave in so
exemplary a manner from that time
as to induce his father to relent, if
possible; for he knew present remonstrance
or pleading would be in vain.</p>

<p>He became so very quiet and regular
in his deportment that he soon
won "golden opinions" on all hands,
much to the delight of his aunt, with
whom he was a special pet, and who
hoped her brother might yet allow
him to remain at home.</p>

<p>It was an unusually warm summer,
and a Mrs. Plimpton, a friend of the
Blairs from the city where they had
formerly resided, came to pass the
warm season with them, bringing her
family&mdash;a son about the age of Frank,
and two daughters younger.</p>

<p>Soon after she came, Mrs. Wingate
and Mrs. Howe called to see her, and
brought George and Henry to call
upon the young strangers and Frank.</p>

<p>When they left, Mrs. Plimpton remarked,
"What very agreeable people!
And those young lads&mdash;so sociable,
modest, and gentlemanly! I do
not wonder that Frank's manners are
so genial and quiet, since he has such
associates."</p>

<p>"Frank does not associate much
with them; and though Mrs. Wingate
and Mrs. Howe are very agreeable,
as you say, yet we have but little intercourse
with them," Mrs. Blair replied,
dryly and frigidly.</p>

<p>"And why not, let me beg to
know?" inquired Mrs. Plimpton with
evident surprise. "In so small a
place I should think you would want
to cultivate sociability with all people
of intelligence and refinement!"</p>

<p>"We would be glad to, and they
would be a valuable acquisition to
any society, if they were not Romanists.
But when enlightened Americans,
who should and do know better,
see fit to plunge themselves into that
abyss of superstition and exploded
absurdities, they ought to be avoided
by all sensible people."</p>

<p>"And is that all?" said Mrs. Plimpton,
laughing. "Why, my dear friend,
I had hoped better things of you! I
supposed by your solemn manner that
there was some serious moral delinquency
on their part. Really, I must
be permitted to dissent entirely from
your theory and practice in this matter.
I am sure you cannot be aware
of all that is going on in our cities.
Many of my dearest friends are Catholics;
some Americans and some
foreigners; and the dear Sisters&mdash;now,
don't look so shocked! I entreat of
you&mdash;are my special favorites, and best
counsellors. I have quite taken them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
into my entire confidence on some
most important affairs. 'Romanists,'
indeed! Why, if we were to proscribe
all the Catholics, we should lose a
charming portion of our society. We
'liberal Christians' do not feel disposed
to carry religious prejudices
into the social circle, or to avoid
pleasant people on account of their
preferences or peculiarities in this respect.
I shall only seek the acquaintance
of these ladies the more earnestly
for this reason. Do you know
how their change of faith was brought
about?"</p>

<p>"I never troubled myself to ask,"
Mrs. Blair said languidly.</p>

<p>"I can tell you!" said Miss Blair.
"I heard the whole story from one
of their particular friends, who has
followed their example. It seems Mr.
Wingate, who is a gentleman of wealth
and leisure, had amused himself by
devoting much time and attention to
studying the principles of architecture&mdash;especially
the ecclesiastical branch,
for which he had a great taste.
When it was proposed to build a Catholic
church in the place, he begged
permission to furnish a plan, which
was accorded. This was so entirely
satisfactory&mdash;combining exquisite artistic
proportions with the close attention
to economy in all the details,
which is indispensable where the resources
are limited&mdash;that he was urged
to superintend the progress of the
building, which he consented to do.
Soon after operations were commenced,
one Patrick Hennessy, an excellent
mechanic, came to the place, having
recently emigrated from Ireland, and
was employed to aid in the work.
Mr. Wingate had frequent conversations&mdash;controversies,
if you will&mdash;with
him on religious subjects, and was
surprised to find, not only that Hennessy
was perfectly acquainted with
all the points at issue between Catholics
and Protestants, but that his own
preconceived opinions in relation to
these questions were many of them
false. He borrowed and read Hennessy's
books, and the result you
know. His wife, a highly cultivated
and thoughtful woman, went with him
heart and hand. Their children were
then quite young.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Howe was a very different
person from her sister, Mrs. Wingate.
She was a fashionable lady, and,
though not as wealthy as her sister,
aspired to lead the <i>ton</i> in our little
village. She assumed many airs, established
intimacies and exchanged
visits with stylish city ladies, which
were more gratifying to her vanity
than creditable to her good sense.
When Mrs. Wingate became a Catholic,
she entirely discontinued all intercourse
with her, and uttered many
sharp remarks upon the subject. She
had never been as much beloved as
her sister, and her course had provoked
many envious and ill-natured comments,
to which was now added the
remark that she had not so much
religion herself that she need be disturbed
by the religious preferences of
others. To tell the story in few words,
she was finally taken suddenly very ill.
The first person she called for was her
discarded sister, who came and watched
over her early and late with devoted
tenderness&mdash;never leaving her bedside.
When the physician pronounced
her case all but utterly hopeless,
she begged that the priest might be
sent for; this had been the object of
her sister's most fervent and constant
prayers, but she had not dared even
to mention it. Mr. Howe, after great
hesitation, at length yielded to the
wish of his idolized and dying wife.
The priest came, baptized and received
her into the Catholic Church. She
lingered a long time, as it were, between
life and death; but a strong
natural constitution prevailed, and she
recovered. After her recovery, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
change in her character was so marked
and entire as to be apparent to all,
and she came to be regarded as even
more lovely than her sister. Mr.
Howe soon followed her example,
and their circle has since been increased
by the addition of converts from
time to time. I entirely agree with
you as to the folly of abstaining from
intercourse with them, and have become
quite familiar with that coterie&mdash;a
delightful one it is, too!"</p>

<p>"And is that all?" Mrs. Blair pointedly
asked.</p>

<p>"All for the present," Miss Blair
replied, smiling.</p>

<p>"How long will it be before you
follow such interesting examples? It
strikes me, I have seen a lady reading
books lately that I should not once
have thought could claim a moment's
attention from her; but wonders will
never cease, I believe!"</p>

<p>"I am not so tied to any set of
opinions as to refuse to read the other
side."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Plimpton, "I
have never thought it worth while to
trouble myself much about these matters;
but I always read whatever I
choose on any subject, and I think
every one has a right to do so."</p>

<h2>CATHOLICITY AND PANTHEISM.<br />

<small>NUMBER NINE.<br />

UNION BETWEEN THE INFINITE AND THE FINITE&mdash;CONTINUED.</small></h2>


<p>In the preceding article we unfolded
the nature of the hypostatic moment,
the solution which the Catholic
Church gives to the problem of the
highest sublimation of the cosmos.
In the present article we shall point
out the consequences which flow from
that moment, in order to put in bolder
relief the nature of the exaltation
which has thereby accrued to the
cosmos.</p>

<p>For the sake of perspicuity, we shall
bring those consequences under the
following heads:</p>

<p>1. Consequences of the hypostatic
moment, viewed in reference to the
external action, as the effective typical
and final cause of the cosmos.</p>

<p>2. Consequences of the hypostatic
moment, considered respectively to the
nature, properties, and action of the
cosmos, as abridged in the human
nature of the Theanthropos.</p>

<p>3. Those which relate to the other
moments and persons of the cosmos.</p>

<p>4. Those which affect the Theanthropos
himself, in relation to the
other moments and persons of the
cosmos.</p>

<p>With respect to the consequences
of the first class, it is evident that the
efficient typical and final cause of the
external works is absolutely and simply
infinite. No real distinction can
be made between God's essence and
his action, between his interior and
exterior action. Any distinction between
these things would imply potentiality
and imperfection, and would
throw us back into pantheism.</p>

<p>God's essence therefore, his interior
and external action, are, ontologically
speaking, one and the same. Now,
God is absolutely infinite; the effective
typical and final cause of the cosmos
is thereby absolutely infinite. In
other words, the cause which calls the
cosmos to being is endowed with infinite
energy; the cause which serves
as its exemplar and pattern, and which
the cosmos must delineate and express,
is the infinite perfections of
God; the cause which inclines God
to effect it is the infinite and transcendental
excellence of his being, as capable
of being communicated. Now,
a cause infinite in every respect would
naturally claim a term corresponding
to the intensity of the action. It is
upon this principle that pantheism
has been framed. An infinite cause
claims a term also infinite. Now, an
effect infinite in its nature is a contradiction
in terms; therefore the work
is and can be nothing more but a
phenomenon of the infinite.</p>

<p>If pantheists had paid attention to
the Catholic theory, that the action
of God, because infinite, is distinct in
two moments, the one immanent and
interior, the other transient and exterior;
that the same action in the
first moment is absolute and necessary,
and gives rise to the eternal
originations which constitute infinite
life; that the same action in the second
moment is absolutely free, and
consequently master of the intensity
of its energy, free to apply as much
of that energy as it chooses; they
would have seen that the above principle
applies to the first but not to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
second moment, and that therefore
their theory rests on a false assumption.</p>

<p>However, though pantheism rests
on a false assumption, it cannot be
denied that there is a certain fitness
between an infinite cause and an effect,
as much as possible corresponding to
the infinite energy of the cause; and
that consequently the external action
of God, because infinite, is for that
very reason inclined to effect the best
possible cosmos, a cosmos almost infinite
in its perfection; an infinite
energy has a tendency to effect an infinite
term; an infinite typical perfection,
to realize an infinite expression;
an infinite yearning of communication,
to impart itself in a manner the most
exhaustive possible.</p>

<p>This fitness of proportion between
cause and effect is so evident as to
baffle all doubt; yet the necessary
distinction implied by the very nature
of cause and effect, a distinction of
infinite superiority on the part of the
one and infinite dependence and inferiority
on the part of the other, in
the present case is that which gives
rise to the problem which may be
formulated as follows: given the infinite
superiority of the cause of the
cosmos, and admitting the essential
inferiority of the effect, how to exalt
the effect to a perfection almost absolute,
and draw it as near the perfection
of the cause as possible, without
destroying the absolute and necessary
finiteness of the effect.</p>

<p>The hypostatic moment is the sublime
and transcendental answer which
God has given to the problem. For
in that mystery the cosmos, as abridged
and recapitulated in human nature,
without ceasing to be what it is,
without losing its essence and nature,
is exalted to the highest possible perfection,
by a union of subsistence with
the Infinite himself. Nay, the infinite
subsistence and personality of the
Word is the subsistence and personality
of the human nature assumed; so that
the human nature, though real and
finite, is at the same time the nature
of the person of the Word, and consequently
partaking of all the dignity,
perfection, and excellence of the Word.
In other terms, the cosmos, as abridged
in the human nature of Christ, is
<i>deified</i>, not indeed by a change of its
ontological being, but by the highest,
strictest, and closest communication
and union with the Godhead. For,
next to the identity of nature, we can
conceive of no closer union or communication
than that which exists between
two distinct natures completed
and actualized by the same identical
subsistence. Now, this identity of
subsistence communicates to the inferior
nature all the worth and dignity
of the superior; and consequently the
human nature of Christ, and hence the
cosmos which it abridges, are, as it
were, deified in such a manner as to
exchange the denomination of attributes,
and we can call man God, and
God man.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Thus the tendency of the infinite
cause of the external works is fully
satisfied. The infinite energy of the
efficient cause has for its term an object
perfectly corresponding to the
intensity of its energy; since it terminates
in an object absolutely infinite&mdash;the
<i>Word</i> completing the two natures,
the divine and the human; an individual
who is very God as well as very
man.</p>

<p>The typical cause is even better
satisfied, so to speak. It tends to express
itself exteriorly, as perfectly as it
exists interiorly. By the hypostatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>moment, the same identical type of
the cosmos, its intelligible and objective
life enters to form part of the
cosmos, the interior <i>logos</i> or <i>schema</i> is
wedded to its exterior expression in
the bond of one subsistence, and is at
the same time type and expression,
objective and subjective life. Unlike
other artists, who must necessarily
regret the impossibility of their impressing
on the external work, be it
marble or canvas, the interior conceptions
of the mind, as fully and as perfectly
as they conceive them interiorly,
the divine artist of the cosmos
found a means whereby to unite, to
bring together type and expression,
the intelligible and the subjective, the
original and the copy, in one identical
person; so that in the person of the
Theanthropos, as you admire the art
so exquisitely divine in the copy,
you are dazzled by the effulgence of
the type which dwells and shines forth
in it; as you wonder at the exactness
of the created expression, you can see
the original conception also, blended
together in one common subsistence.
The end also of the external work is
fully attained. For in the hypostatic
moment the infinite and transcendental
excellence of God is communicated
in a manner beyond which you
could not go; God in this moment
yielding himself so far as to make his
own subsistence common to human
nature, and thus making it share in
his infinite dignity, attributes, and the
very name of God.</p>

<p>We shall allude to one consequence
only of the second class; those having
reference to the sublimation of the
cosmos; and that is the life of the
cosmos.</p>

<p>Life is action and movement. Those
beings which act not exist but do not
live. If, therefore, the action of the
cosmos has been elevated to the highest
possible perfection by the hypostatic
moment, it follows that its life
also has been exalted.</p>

<p>Now, though action originates in
the nature, which is the first principle
of action in a being, yet its ontological
worth and dignity it receives from
the subsistence or person, because the
nature would be an abstraction, a possibility,
without the subsistence.</p>

<p>In the case, therefore, of an individual
in whom the nature is inferior,
and the subsistence, which actualizes
and completes the nature, is superior,
in the scale of being, the actions primarily
originating from nature as their
first root have all the ontological
worth of the subsistence, and not of
the nature.</p>

<p>Consequently, all the human actions
of Christ, primarily originating
in his human nature, partake of the
ontological dignity and value of his
person, and not of his human nature;
just because his human nature is
completed by and subsists in the personality
of the Word.</p>

<p>Now, this personality is infinite;
infinite, therefore, is the ontological
worth of the human actions of Christ.</p>

<p>And if we consider, as we have already
remarked, that human nature is
a recapitulation of all the elements of
the cosmos, since it shares spirit, intelligence,
and will with the angelic nature,
sensible apprehension with animal
nature, life with the vegetable
nature, and locomotion with inorganic
nature, it follows that all the actions
of the cosmos are recapitulated
in human nature, and that consequently
they are exalted to an infinite worth
and dignity in the human nature of
Christ, which is completed by his infinite
personality.</p>

<p>The consequences of the third class
will better explain and develop this
exaltation of the life of the cosmos.
The object of the external action consists
in manifesting the infinite excellence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
and perfections of God. This
creation does in two different ways:
1st, ontologically, the very nature of
the cosmos being an expression, a
likeness of the infinite. This function
is discharged indistinctly both by
intelligent and unintelligent beings.</p>

<p>2d. But this function, by which
unintelligent creatures unconsciously
manifest in their nature and properties
the excellence of God, in intelligent
creatures is necessarily a moral act,
and gives rise to the virtue of religion;
because intelligent creatures
cannot possibly fail to perceive the
relation which binds them to their
creator, and to feel the duty of acknowledging
it.</p>

<p>Hence, religion is an absolute duty
for intelligent beings; so necessary
and absolute that the opposite assertion
would be a contradiction in
terms.</p>

<p>To say a creature, is to affirm a
being created by God with the express
purpose of manifesting his perfections;
to say intelligent, is to affirm
a creature able to perceive this relation,
and able to fulfil the purpose
which it perceives was intended by
the creator. To absolve, therefore,
intelligent creatures from the duty of
religion, is to affirm and deny in the
same breath that they <em>are</em> intelligent
creatures.</p>

<p>Hence, they must necessarily perceive
and will the relation in which
they stand to their creator, and consequently
be religious by force of their
very nature and existence.</p>

<p>The whole cosmos must pay to
God, its creator, the homage of religion;
unintelligent creatures by unconsciously
portraying his perfections;
intelligent creatures, by acknowledging
the same with their intelligence
and will.</p>

<p>Now, this first function of the cosmos,
this primary act of its life, is
elevated to the highest possible perfection
through the hypostatic moment.
For through this moment the
external religion of the cosmos is elevated
to the dignity and grandeur of
the internal religion.</p>

<p>Philosophers and theologians do
not treat of the existence of the eternal
and objective religion, as often as
they do of that religion which expresses
the relations between the creator
and his creatures, and might be
styled external and temporal religion.
But every thing temporal is the counterpart
of something eternal; every
subjective existence has an intelligible
objective existence in eternity, a type
without which its subjective existence
were inconceivable.</p>

<p>Religion, then, must have its type
in God; in his infinite essence must
be found those eternal laws which
render temporal religion possible.</p>

<p>What is there in the essence of the
infinite which constitutes religion, and
establishes its laws?</p>

<p>The eternal religion is the life of
God, its laws the laws of the genesis
of his life.</p>

<p>God is a living, personal being.
He is unborn, unbegotten, intelligent
activity; first termination of the Godhead.
By one eternal, immanent
glance of his intelligence he searches,
so to speak, and scrutinizes the innermost
depths of his essence, and thus
comprehends himself, that is, conceives
and utters himself interiorly.</p>

<p>This infinite, most perfect utterance
and intelligible expression of
himself is a second termination of the
Godhead; the Word, who portrays
and manifests the Godhead intelligibly;
as the first person is the actuation
of the Godhead under the termination
of intelligent, primary, independent
activity and principle.</p>

<p>This duality of terminations is
brought into harmony by a third person,
the result of the action of both.
For between the intelligent principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
uttering himself intelligibly, and the
utterance, the term of that intellectual
conception, there passes necessarily
an infinite attraction, a blissful sympathy,
an unutterable complacency.</p>

<p>The Father beholds as in a bright,
clear stream of infinite light the unspeakable
beauty and loveliness of
his infinite perfections, and utters them
to himself, and delights in that utterance.
The Son beholds himself as
the most perfect, the consubstantial
representation of the sublime excellence
of the Father, and takes complacency
in him as the principle of his
personality.</p>

<p>This common complacency, sympathy,
attraction, love, bliss, is the
third termination of the Godhead, the
Holy Spirit, the breath of the love of
both, the personal subsisting attraction
of the Father and of the Son, the person
who closes the cycle of God's infinite
life.</p>

<p>This is the eternal, immanent, objective
religion. For what is religion
in its highest metaphysical acceptation?
It is the intelligible and loving
acknowledgment of the infinite nature
and attributes of God. Now, the
Word is the infinite, substantial, and
intelligible acknowledgment of the Father;
the Holy Ghost is the infinite,
substantial, loving acknowledgment
of both. Therefore, the eternal mystery
of the life of the infinite, the Trinity,
is also the eternal objective religion
by which God acknowledges, appreciates
and honors himself.</p>

<p>It might be objected to the soundness
of this doctrine, that one of the
relations, which is the principal and
fundamental in religion, the relation
of dependence, is wanting in the life
of the infinite, and that consequently
that life cannot be taken as the eternal
type of religion.</p>

<p>In the metaphysical idea of religion,
dependence is necessary as the fundamental
relation upon which all others
rest. Because religion is essentially
an acknowledgment of one person
from another. Therefore, the person
who acknowledges himself as indebted
to another for something must, by
that very fact, be dependent upon
him. The intelligible acknowledgment
means that one intelligent being
perceives with his mind that he stands
indebted to another for something,
and consequently depends upon him
for that thing. The practical or loving
acknowledgment conveys the idea
that the person who has perceived his
standing indebted to another for something,
acts in such a manner as to express
by his action his sense of the
dependence. Religion is therefore
an intelligible and practical dependence
of one person upon another.</p>

<p>But this relation of dependence
does not necessarily imply the idea
of inferiority in the hierarchy of being
upon the part of the person
who is dependent, and a like superiority
on the part of the person who
is acknowledged. A dependence of
origin or procession, without including
any inferiority on the part of him
who is dependent, is fully and absolutely
sufficient in the metaphysical
idea of transcendental religion.</p>

<p>The reason of this lies in the very
nature of transcendental religion or
acknowledgment. By this we seek
the highest possible, the most perfect
idea of acknowledgment, which necessarily
implies an equality between
the person who acknowledges and
the person who is acknowledged.
Otherwise, without the equality the
acknowledgment would fall short of the
perfection of the object acknowledged.
Now, an inferiority of nature and attributes
in the person who acknowledges
would destroy the equality and
imply an inferiority of acknowledgment,
and consequently would not
represent the idea of the highest, most
perfect acknowledgment and religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>The Son, therefore, depending upon
the Father as to his origin, though absolutely
equal to him in nature and
attributes, and being the intelligible, infinite
expression of the perfections of
the Father, is, by force of his very personality,
the subsisting, living, speaking
acknowledgment of the Father.</p>

<p>The Holy Ghost, depending upon
the Father and the Son as to origin,
though perfectly equal to them as to
nature, and being the loving expression
of the infinite goodness of both,
is, by force of his very personality, the
living, practical recognition of the Father
and of the Son.</p>

<p>The eternal life of God, therefore,
is the eternal typical religion. It is
the only true religion in the transcendental
meaning of the term. Because
the more perfect is the recognition,
the more adequate it is to the
object, and the more it approaches
to metaphysical truth, which lies in
the equation of the type with its expression.
It is the only religion worthy
of God. For religion, as we have
said, is the intelligible and practical
recognition of God. Now, every one
can see that such recognition, to be
worthy of God, must be absolutely
perfect. The intelligible recognition
must imply such an idea of God as
to be absolute utterance of his nature
and perfections; the loving recognition
must love God in the most perfect
and absolute sense of the word. Now,
God being infinite, an infinite, intelligible
recognition, an infinite, practical,
loving acknowledgment only can be
worthy of him. He alone can know
and love himself as he deserves. Now,
to draw nearer to our subject, we inquire,
Is temporal religion worthy of
God? And we observe, before answering
the question, that by temporal
religion we do not mean that recognition
of God which results from
the ontological essence of all the beings
of the cosmos, but that voluntary
and reflex acknowledgment which
created spirits, whether men or angels,
are bound to pay to their maker.
We ask, therefore, is the acknowledgment
which created spirits pay to God
worthy of him, worthy of his infinite
and transcendental nature and perfections?
Evidently not. Because the
intelligence of the cherubim, however
high and lofty, and soaring as far
above the intelligence of inferior created
spirits as the eagle's flight over
all the feathered tribes; the love of
the seraphim, however intense, however
deep, however tender, however
ardent, are merely and simply finite.
On the other hand, what is the intelligence
and love of men compared
with those of the heavenly spirits, who
are so near the supreme intelligence
and love, when compared to us, and
yet so far from it, when compared
with God?</p>

<p>The religion, therefore, of all created
spirits is not proportionate to its
object; it falls infinitely short of the merits
of God. Hence the cosmos, of which
created spirits form the best part, with
the exclusion of the Incarnate Word,
cannot properly discharge the first
and paramount duty of the creature,
the homage of acknowledgment and
adoration to its creator.</p>

<p>But let the Word, the eternal mediator
between God and the cosmos,
let the intelligible and objective life,
the type of the cosmos, enter into it,
and the worth of the nature and the
acts of the cosmos shall be exalted,
elevated, changed, transformed; and it
can then pay to God a tribute of recognition
fully, perfectly, and absolutely
worthy of him.</p>

<p>For the Theanthropos&mdash;the God-Man,
who is possessed of infinite intelligence,
and can comprehend God
as far as God is intelligible, who is
possessed of infinite will, and can
love God as far as God is amiable,
can recognize him, acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
him, theoretically and practically,
as perfectly as he deserves, with
absolute equation. And the human
nature of the Theanthropos, though
in itself finite in its essence and in its
acts, can likewise render to God a
homage fully and perfectly worthy of
him. First, because the acts of the
Word of God, honoring the infinite
majesty theoretically and practically
in an infinite manner, are acts
also belonging to human nature, are
its own acts, so to speak; because
they are acts of its own personality,
and human nature can say to God, I
honor thee with the acts of my own
person, and they are infinite. Secondly,
because even the acts springing
immediately from human nature,
and consequently in themselves finite,
in force of the union of these same
acts with the divine personality in
whom they subsist, acquire an infinite
worth and dignity because of the person
in whom they subsist; and human
nature can say to God, I honor you
with my own acts of worship and acknowledgment.
In both cases, therefore,
whether we look at the acts of
the Theanthropos springing from his
divine nature, or at those proceeding
from his human nature, they are of
infinite value, by force of the unity of
his divine person; and consequently
the Theanthropos can recognize God
in an infinite manner, a manner absolutely
worthy of God.</p>

<p>The cosmos, then, recapitulated in
the human nature of Christ, is enabled
to worship God as he deserves;
the temporal religion of the cosmos
is wedded to the eternal; and the
Godhead is worshipped in his cosmos
with the same perfect homage
of recognition as he receives from
eternity in the bosom of his interior
life. The Word, as infinite recognition
of the Father, is the eternal mediator
of religion between the Father and
the Holy Ghost. The Word incarnate
is the mediator of religion between
God and his cosmos.</p>

<p>All angels and men, and to a certain
degree all creatures, all persons,
all individualities, from the highest
pinnacle of creation down to the farthest
extremities thereof, united in a
particular manner, which shall be hereafter
explained, with the Theanthropos,
and partakers of his mind, of his
will, of his affections, of his heart, of
his life, can raise to God a canticle
of acknowledgment fully worthy of
him, perfectly equal to that which
rose up silently in the bosom of the
infinite, when, in the day of his eternity,
he uttered his infinite word, and
breathed his spirit and recognized himself
very God.</p>

<p>Who will not admit a dogma which
elevates the cosmos to such a height
of dignity? And what can pantheism
offer in its stead? It can destroy
both temporal and eternal religion,
by identifying both terms, the cosmos
and the infinite, and thus rendering
a true acknowledgment of God
impossible. But it can never impart
that true exaltation, that high dignity
to the cosmos, which the Catholic
doctrine of the hypostatic moment
affords. God acknowledges himself
infinitely from all eternity, by uttering
a perfect intellectual expression of
himself, and by both aspiring a loving
recognition of themselves. We creatures
are enabled to acknowledge him
as he acknowledges himself; the only
recognition worthy of him. The
Word, by becoming incarnate, enters
into the choir of creation, and takes
its leadership; brings into it the harmonies
of the bosom of God, and on
a sudden the music and the songs of
the cosmos rise up to the height of
its leader, and mingle with the harmonies
of eternal life.</p>

<p>Before we pass to other consequences
of the incarnation, we shall point
out a corollary, among all others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
which follows from the doctrine above
stated, and which, though of the highest
importance, is lost sight of both
by apologists and rationalists.</p>

<p>This corollary is, that the Christian
religion, as Christ founded it, is <i>cosmological
law</i>, and can no more be lost
sight of by the philosopher than by a
Christian himself.</p>

<p>For according to the actual plan
of the cosmos, the plan which God
selected, God was not satisfied with
that finite, imperfect, natural acknowledgment
which created spirits might
render to him. But, as he was pleased
not to leave the cosmos in its natural
conditions, but raised it to the
highest possible dignity by a union
with the divine personality of the
Word, so he was not satisfied that the
acknowledgment which is due to him
as the creator should be that natural,
imperfect, finite acknowledgment
which created spirits could, with their
natural force, render to him, but willed
that their acknowledgment should,
by a union with the Theanthropos, be
exalted to the dignity of the infinite
acknowledgment which he renders to
himself from all eternity.</p>

<p>This is a law of the actual cosmos
which God selected, and it is as much
a law, an integral part of its constituents,
as any natural law which we
may discover. God selected such a
cosmos that we might pay to him a
recognition true and worthy of him.</p>

<p>Now, Christianity, as Christ founded
it, is the religion of all created persons
in time and space, who, united to the
Theanthropos by a particular mode
of union, worship God with and
through the Theanthropos; that is,
worship God as he deserves. Consequently
Christianity is a law of the
cosmos, an integral constituent of that
cosmos which God selected, and
hence true, elevating, and imperative.</p>

<p>True, because it is a religion the
acts of which are fully adequate to the
object, since in it God is worshipped
as perfectly as he deserves.</p>

<p>True, because, religion implying a
knowledge of God, in Christianity
knowledge is imparted to the minds
of its followers fully adequate to the
object known, in its origin, in its mode
of communication, and its end. In
its origin, being derived from the
Theanthropos; in its mode, being imparted
by a peculiar operation of the
Theanthropos; and in its end, as
tending to gradual development, until
it has reached the fulness of knowledge,
which may be imparted to a
pure creature in palingenesia.</p>

<p>True, because, religion implying
operation and action, action is imparted
in the same manner as knowledge.</p>

<p>Elevating, because it is evident that
that aim of Christianity is to raise human
persons from their natural state,
from their natural operation, to a superior
state and operation through the
Theanthropos.</p>

<p>Imperative, because, God having
made Christianity a law of the cosmos,
which he selected, it is not free to a
moral agent to accept or reject it, but
all must accept it as a law of the cosmos
which no one may contravene.</p>

<p>Hence rationalists, and infidels, and
indifferentists, in rejecting Christianity
or in being indifferent to it, reject a
law of the cosmos, a law which is as
essential to the entirety of the cosmos,
which God chose, as the law of gravitation
or locomotion; and in reasoning
upon the cosmos, after rejecting
Christianity, rationalists and indifferentists
should say, "I do not reason
on the actual cosmos that God has
selected; I reason on a cosmos of my
own creation; I limit it, I contract it,
I debase it, as it pleases my fancy;
and yet, after that, I insist on retaining
the name of philosopher."</p>

<p>We pass to the other consequence.
The tendency of the exterior act is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
form the cosmos, and especially created
intelligences, into a universal society.
We could prove this by the
consideration of the efficient, typical,
and final cause of the external act;
but prefer to show it only from the
typical cause, or objective life of creation.</p>

<p>The objective life of the cosmos is
the life of the infinite intelligibly expressed
in the Word. Now, God's
life is essentially one, absolute, most
perfect, universal society. One is the
nature of the infinite terminated and
concreted by three distinct subsistences&mdash;the
Beginning, the Word, the
Spirit. One and identical is their intelligence
and will; because intelligence
and will, being an attribute of
nature, as the three divine personalities
partake of the same nature, they
are at the same time endowed with the
same identical intelligence and will.</p>

<p>One and identical is likewise their
life and bliss; because the life and
bliss of the infinite consists in knowing
and loving himself, in which operation
the three divine personalities share, in
force of the identical absolute intelligence
and will with which they are
equally endowed. They are finally
one by their common and reciprocal
indwelling in each other; because the
beginning is Father, inasmuch as his
eternal Son dwells in his bosom. The
Son is such, inasmuch as he is related
to the Father, and dwells in him. The
Spirit is such, inasmuch as he is related
to both, and dwells in both.</p>

<p>The Trinity, therefore, is the type
of one universal perfect society, because
the three divine persons are
associated by the unity and identity
of nature, of attributes, of life, of happiness,
and by a common indwelling
in each other.</p>

<p>Now, the Trinity, as intelligibly mirrored
in the Word, is the objective life
of the cosmos, or its typical cause. On
the other hand, we have shown that
the plan which God has chosen in his
works <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad extra</i> is that which draws
the subjective cosmos as near in perfection
to its intelligible and objective
life as possible.</p>

<p>The cosmos, therefore, in force of
its typical cause, is called to represent
the one most perfect universal society
of the three divine persons as perfectly
as possible.</p>

<p>This were impossible except by the
admission of the existence of the
Theanthropos into creation. For, once
admitting the existence of the Theanthropos,
we see that the eternal society
of the three divine persons, as
mirrored intelligibly in the Word, the
very typical cause of the cosmos, has
come in contact with the cosmos itself,
by the closest, most intimate society&mdash;the
same identical subsistence:
the eternal and interior society is externated,
and the cosmos and the infinite
society of God form one single
society in the identity of the person
of the Word. Man and God are one
single society in Christ. Unite now
all created spirits and persons to this
externation of the typical cause, by a
principle of which we shall speak in
the next article; unite their nature to
his nature, their intelligence to his intelligence,
their will to his will, their
life to his life, their bliss to his bliss;
and we shall have one universal society,
partaking of the nature, the intelligence,
the will, the life, the bliss,
of the Theanthropos; and thus not
only united with each other, and
meeting each other in one common
medium and centre, but also presenting
a divine society whose bond of
union is the intelligence, will, life,
bliss, of the Theanthropos communicated
to them all; and through him
and by him ushered into the eternal
society of the Trinity.</p>

<p>This is the idea expressed in the
sublime prayer of our Lord, when he
said, Father, keep them in thy name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
whom thou hast given me, that they
may be one as <span class="smcap">WE</span> also are. And not
for them only do I pray, but for them
also who through their word shall believe
in me; that they all may be one,
as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee;
that they also may be one in us, I
in them, and thou in me, that they
may be made perfect in one: that
the love wherewith thou hast loved
me may be in them, and I in them.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>This consequence of the hypostatic
moment affords the cosmological reason
of the truth, the divinity, the imperative
necessity of the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>For the Catholic Church is nothing
else but the society of all the persons
of the cosmos elevated in Christ and
through Christ to the eternal typical
society of the Trinity, by a community
of supernatural intelligence, will, life,
bliss, imparted to them by the Theanthropos,
to whom they are united, travelling
centuries and generations to
add new members to this universal
society of all ages, until the number
of members being complete, it shall
cease its temporal action, and rest in
eternity. This is the only true view
of the Catholic Church. Men imagine
it to be an after-thought, a thing
begun nineteen centuries ago. The
Catholic Church is a cosmological
law; and hence <i>necessary</i>, <i>universal</i>,
<i>imperative</i>. God in acting outside
himself might have chosen to effect
only substantial creation; but having
once determined to effect the hypostatic
moment, to cause the Theanthropos
to form the exalting principle,
the centre, the mediator of the cosmos,
he could not but carry out to
their fullest expression those relations
which result from that moment. Now,
the Catholic Church is the necessary
consequence of the hypostatic moment.
The Word, the type of the
universe, is united to its expression in
the unity of his divine personality,
and is thus placed at the very centre
of the universe, as that in which all
things are consolidated. It follows,
therefore, that all created persons
must hover round about their centre,
must be put in communication with
him, united to him as their centre and
mediator by a communion of intelligence,
of will, of life, of bliss, and thus
be associated with each other, and
united with the eternal archetypical
society&mdash;the Trinity.</p>

<p>This gives as a result a society of
all created persons united by the bond
of the same theanthropic intelligence,
will, life, and bliss.</p>

<p>Now, such is the Catholic Church.
Therefore it is a cosmological law in
the present plan of the exterior action
of God; and as a cosmological
law is <i>universal</i>, extending to all
times and places, <i>divine</i> in its origin
and action, and <i>imperative</i>, so the
Catholic Church is essentially <i>universal</i>
in time and space; <i>divine</i> in its
origin and action; <i>imperative</i>, enforcing
its acceptance and adhesion on
every intellect which can contemplate
the plan of the exterior works of God.</p>

<p>Hence Protestantism is not only a
theological error, but a philosophical
blunder.</p>

<p>God effects the hypostatic moment,
and makes the Theanthropos the centre
of the cosmos, and of the best
part of the cosmos&mdash;men. He could
not be their centre unless they were
united to him by intelligence, will,
and life. And they could not be
united to him unless they were united
to each other by a common theanthropic
intelligence, will, and life,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
And the question being of incarnate
spirits, this union of intelligence,
will, and life could not be possible,
except it were visible and external.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>
<p>Hence, it is a necessary consequence
of the hypostatic moment
that men should be united in one
universal, visible, and external society.
Protestantism, admitting the hypostatic
moment, denies the consequence
which so evidently flows from it, and
denies by its fundamental principle a
society of intelligence, and of will,
and of life, and also the visibility, the
externation of such society, and takes
refuge in an individual union between
himself and Christ, and says, by the
same principle, "I have a right to
form an intelligence of my own, in
no way connected with the intelligence
of other created persons. I
have a right to follow laws which I
shall individually find out and proclaim.
I have a right to have a life
exclusively my own, and no interchange
shall pass between me and
others."</p>

<p>Hence the absolute falsehood of
Protestantism, which ignores the existence
and qualities of this supreme
cosmological law.</p>

<p>The cosmological law is <i>one</i>. Protestantism
is <i>multiform</i>. The cosmological
law is <i>universal</i>. Protestantism
is <i>individual</i>. The cosmological
law is <i>communicative</i> and <i>expansive</i>.
Protestantism is <i>egotistical</i>.</p>

<p>What is more remarkable still is
the astounding pretension of Protestantism
to having enlightened and
elevated mankind. Enlightened mankind
by ignoring the plan of the universe
in its beauty, in its harmony,
in its whole! Elevated mankind by
proclaiming individualism and egotism
in the face of the one great life-giving
law of a common universal society!</p>

<p>We would beg our Protestant readers
to ask themselves the following
questions:</p>

<p>Is it true that God made Christ,
the Word incarnate, the centre of the
cosmos, and hence the centre of all
created persons?</p>

<p>Is it true that, in consequence of
this, created persons should be united
to him by partaking of his intelligence,
will, and life?</p>

<p>Is it true that, in force of this union,
all created persons become united
to each other in force of the principle
that two things united to a third
are united to each other?</p>

<p>Is it true that God has effected all
this in order to elevate human society
to the society of his eternal life?</p>

<p>Is it not true that the Catholic
Church is nothing but that?</p>

<p>Then the Catholic Church is <i>cosmological
law, one, divine, universal,
imperative</i>.</p>

<p>We pass to the fourth class of consequences,
those which regard the
Theanthropos in relation to all the
moments and persons of the cosmos.</p>

<p>I. The Theanthropos was intended
by God before and above all other
works.</p>

<p>Every one is aware that an intellectual
agent, in effecting his works,
follows a different order from that
which he pursues in planning them;
in other words, the order of execution
which an intellectual agent follows
is in the inverse ratio of the order
which he follows in idealizing
them. In an architect's mind the
end and use of a building is first in
order, and he idealizes and shapes
his building according to the object
intended. In the execution of the
work the order is inverted, the building
is effected first, the object and
use are attained afterward.</p>

<p>The order followed in idealizing a
work is called by schoolmen the order
of <i>intention;</i> that which is pursued
in executing the work, the order
of <i>execution</i>. When we say, therefore,
that the hypostatic moment and the
Theanthropos are the first of God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
external works, we mean, of course,
in the order of intention; we mean
that they were intended by God first
and before every other work when
he resolved to act outside himself;<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
so that the incarnation was determined
upon, not only independently of the
sin of man, but would have taken
place even if man had never fallen.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>The metaphysical reason of this
consequence is found in the relation
which means bear to the end. It is
absolutely necessary that an intellectual
agent should intend primarily
and chiefly that object which is best
calculated to attain the end he has in
view in his action; which best fulfils
his intention and is the most appropriate
and nearest mean.</p>

<p>Now, the hypostatic moment, and
consequently Christ, attains better
than any other moment or individual
the object of the external action of
God, as we have shown. Therefore
Christ was intended by God first and
above every other work.</p>

<p>This consequence is poetically described
by the inspired author of the
Proverbs, in those beautiful lines so
well known:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Lord possessed me from the beginning
of his ways, before he made any thing
from the beginning.</p>

<p>"I was set up from all eternity, and of
old before the earth was made.</p>

<p>"The depths were not as yet, and I was
already conceived; neither had the foundations
of water as yet sprung out.</p>

<p>"The mountains with their huge bulk had
not as yet been established; before the hills
I was brought forth.</p>

<p>"He had not made the earth, nor the rivers,
nor the poles of the world.</p>

<p>"When he prepared the heavens, I was
present; when with a certain law and compass
he inclosed the depths," etc.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>2. Consequence. The Theanthropos
is the secondary end of God's
external works.</p>

<p>For, in a series of means necessary
to the end, that which is first and
chief is also end in respect to the
other means. Christ, therefore, being
the first and chief means to attain
the end of the external act, is also
end in reference to the other moments,
and consequently the secondary end
of the cosmos. "All things," said
St. Paul to the Corinthians, "are
yours; and you are Christ's, and
Christ is God's."</p>

<p>3. Christ is the secondary type of
the cosmos. Ontologically speaking,
the end determines and shapes the nature
and perfections of the means, and
bears to the means the relation of
type and exemplar. Now, Christ is
the secondary end of the cosmos;
he is, therefore, the secondary model
and type of the exterior works; in
other words, he is the best and supremest
expression of God's infinite
excellence, the archetype of the cosmos;
therefore he is also the secondary
type of the cosmos.</p>

<p>4. Christ is the universal mediator
between God and his works.</p>

<p>As in the bosom of God the Word
is the medium in the genesis of his
eternal life, the link which connects
the Father and the Spirit; so, outside
of God, the incarnate Word is the
mediator, the medium universal and
absolute, between God and his works,
the link connecting the infinite and
the finite.</p>

<p>For, in the first place, the very nature
of the hypostatic moment makes
him such. He is the <i>Word</i>, that is,
the very Godhead, with his infinite
nature and perfections, under the termination
of intelligibility.</p>

<p>He is man, comprehending in his
human nature all the various elements
of substantial creation. Both the
Godhead and the human nature subsist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
of that one termination of intelligibility.
It is evident, therefore, that
the incarnate Word is essentially, by
the very nature of the hypostatic
union, the medium between the infinite
and the finite.</p>

<p>Moreover, every intellectual agent
is linked to his work by the type of
it existing in the intelligence, without
which knowledge the agent could
never communicate with his work.
The divine Artist of the cosmos, therefore,
is in communication with it by
the eternal cosmic type residing in
his essence&mdash;the Word. Now, Christ
is the Word incarnate, and, as such,
is the type of the cosmos hypostatically
united to its expression, the intelligible
and objective life personally
linked to the subjective. He is, therefore,
the medium between the objective
and subjective cosmos, and consequently
between the cosmos and God.</p>

<p>Hence Christ is essentially the mediator
of creation, both in the natural
and supernatural moment; inasmuch
as by him and through him all things
were made in both orders.</p>

<p>He is essentially the mediator of
the continuation of existence in both
orders; since the same action, by
which all things were made, through
him continues to hold them in existence.</p>

<p>He is essentially the mediator of
the action of creatures in both orders;
since the same action by which all
things are made to exist, and to continue
in existence through him, incites
them to action and aids them to develop
their faculties. He is essentially
the mediator of perfection and
beatitude; because the same action,
which incites and aids all existences,
both in the natural and supernatural
order, to develop their faculties, must
also perfect them, and bring them to
their final completion. And in the
very act of beatitude, when the dawn
of the vision of God shall flash before
the mind of created spirits, the Theanthropos
shall be the mediator between
them and the superabundant
and dazzling effulgence of the infinite,
by aiding and invigorating their intellect
with the light of glory.</p>

<p>"In him (Christ) were all things
created in heaven and on earth, visible
and invisible. He is before all,
and by him all things consist."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>5. Christ is the supreme universal
objective science; the supreme
universal objective dialectic.</p>

<p>In the ontological order intelligibility
and reality are one and the
same thing; every thing real being
by the very fact intelligible, and <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>

<p>Now, Christ is the infinite and finite
reality, hypostatically united together.
He is, therefore, the infinite finite intelligibility,
and consequently the universal
objective science.</p>

<p>He is also the supreme universal
objective dialectic; for he is essentially
the type and the form of all
reasoning. The form of all reasoning
consists in the comparison of two
terms with a third, with a view of deducing
their agreement or disagreement.
Christ is at once the infinite
universal term, and the finite and particular
term; both terms agreeing together
in the oneness of his divine
personality. He is, therefore, the type
and form of all reasoning, and the
objective dialectic.</p>

<p>6. He is the light of all finite
intelligences. Because, in the first
place, he is the space of essences, so
to speak; being the subsisting intelligibility
of the Godhead.</p>

<p>Secondly. Because in his individuality
there is the ontological agreement
of all the problems of the human
mind, and the solution of all the
questions relative to the infinite and
the finite, to time and eternity, to the
absolute and the relative, to immutability
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>and movement, to cause and
effect, etc.</p>

<p>Thirdly. Because he is the incarnate
Word, creating, supporting, elevating
and perfecting all created intelligences,
in force of his essential office
of universal mediator of the cosmos.</p>

<p>7. Christ is the supreme universal
and objective morality.</p>

<p>The moral perfection of the cosmos
consists in the voluntary realization
of the final perfection to which
it is destined by its archetype.</p>

<p>Now, Christ is the archetype of the
cosmos. Therefore, he is the supreme
objective morality. He is also supreme
morality in the sense of his
inciting and aiding the cosmos in the
voluntary reproduction and realization
of the type, in force of his office
of mediator. Therefore, etc.</p>

<p>8. Christ is the supreme objective
realization of the beautiful.</p>

<p>The beautiful lies in variety reduced
to unity by order and proportion.
Christ is the infinite and finite, the
two beings most distant, brought together
into the unity of his divine personality
by order and proportion, as
it is evident to every mind that has
grasped the nature of the hypostatic
moment.</p>

<p>He is, therefore, the supreme, universal
realization of the beautiful.</p>

<p>9. Christ is the supreme and universal
king and ruler of the universe.</p>

<p>For he is the medium of the creation,
preservation, and action of the
cosmos; he is its secondary end and
exemplar; he is the type and light of
intelligence, the law of morality and
of the beautiful.</p>

<p>The cosmos, therefore, is subject
and dependent upon him for so many
reasons, and consequently he is the
supreme ruler of it.</p>

<p>10. He is the centre of all the
other moments and persons of the
cosmos; all things gathering around
him as their chief, their exemplar,
their mediator.</p>

Beginning and the End." (Apoc. i. 8.)</p>

<h2>BRITTANY: ITS PEOPLE AND ITS POEMS.<br />

<small>SECOND ARTICLE.</small></h2>


<p>More than a year has elapsed
since we expressed a hope to present
our readers with some further specimens
of the ancient poetry of Brittany.
We then gave, translated from
their rendering into French by M. de
VillemarquÃ©, a portion of bardic
poems, for example, <cite>The Prophecy of
Gwench'lan</cite>; <cite>The Submersion of
the City of Is</cite>; <cite>The Changeling</cite>, and
<cite>The March of Arthur</cite>. These, as
well as the dialogue between a Druid
and a child, (which is perhaps too
long for insertion here,) <cite>The Plague
of Elliant</cite>, and portions of <cite>Lord Nann
and the Fay</cite>, retain much of their
scientific and often alliterative form,
a part of which is their arrangement
in tercets, or strophes of three lines
rhyming together.</p>

<p>We now proceed to fulfil our promise
with regard to the ballad of
<cite>Lord Nann</cite>, which, however, it may
be well to preface with some remarks
upon that portion of Breton mythology
which it illustrates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal supernatural agents
in the popular poetry of Brittany are
the dwarfs and the fairies.</p>

<p>The common appellation of these
elfish beings is <i>Korrigan</i>, whether
masculine or feminine, from korr,
little, (diminutive, korrik,) and gan
or gwen, genius.</p>

<p>The Goddess Koridgwen is said
by the Welsh bards to have had nine
attendant virgins, called the nine
Korrigan. This also was the name
of the nine priestesses of the Isle of
Sein.</p>

<p>The Breton fairies not only bear
the same name as the Keltic goddesses
and consecrated virgins, but are accredited
with the same powers of
foretelling future events, of curing
by magical charms diseases otherwise
incurable, of transporting themselves
from one end of the world to the
other in a moment of time, and of
taking whatever forms they please.</p>

<p>Every year, at the return of spring,
they hold, on the green turf near some
fountain, a grand nocturnal feast. In
the midst of the most delicate viands
there sparkles a cup of crystal, of
which the splendor is so great that
there is no need of torches, and like
the magic vase of the British Keridgwen,
containing a marvellous liquid,
one single drop of which conveys the
knowledge of all sciences, and of all
events, past, present, and to come.</p>

<p>The favorite haunts of the Korrigan
are always by springs of water, especially
those which are in lonely places
in the neighborhood of Druidic remains
called dolmens, and from which
the Holy Virgin, who is said to be
their especial enemy, has not yet
chased them. Their traditional aspect
is much the same as that of the
other fairy races of European nations;
their delicate and aerial frames being
about two feet in height, perfect in
symmetry, and clad in the very thinnest
of ethereal textures. But all
their beauty is nocturnal only. By
the light of day, which they hate above
all things, they are hideous, red-eyed,
wrinkled, and old; their whole appearance
betokening fallen intelligences.
The Breton peasants assure
us that they are great princesses who
were struck by the curse of heaven
for refusing to embrace the Christian
faith when the first missionaries
preached it in Armorica. The peasants
of Wales declare them to be the
souls of Druidesses, condemned to do
penance.</p>

<p>Their breath is deadly. Should
any wayfarer trouble the waters of
their fountain, or, near their dolmen,
come upon them suddenly, he is almost
sure to perish; particularly if it
be on a Saturday, the day consecrated
to the Blessed Virgin, against whom
they bear an especial hatred. They
also have a great aversion to any
token of religion, fleeing at the sound
of a consecrated bell or at the sight
of a soutane.</p>

<p>Like certain of their European
cousins, the Korrigan have a decided
<i>penchant</i> for stealing the infant offspring
of the human race, with the
object of regenerating their own.
Therefore does the peasant mother
of Brittany place round the neck of
her babe a scapular or a rosary, that
he may be secured against every elfish
device, under the protection of Our
Blessed Lady.</p>

<p>The changelings whom the Korrigan
are accused of leaving in the place of
the children whom they carry away
are of the race of dwarfs, and also
bear the name of korr, korrik, and
korrigan; as well as kornandon,
gwanzigan, or duz. This last name
is that of the father of Merlin, and of
an ancient divinity worshipped in
that part of Britain which is now the
county of York.</p>

<p>These dwarfs, we are told, are little,
black, and hairy monsters, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
the claws of a cat, the hind legs of a
goat, and a voice harsh and broken
with age. They it was who, ages
ago, raised the huge stones of the
menhir and dolmen, and hid beneath
them untold hoards of treasure.
Around these, when the stars are out,
they are fond of dancing, to the primitive
song which consists in an incessant
repetition of the names of all
the days of the week except Saturday
and Sunday, of which they studiously
avoid all mention. Wednesday, the
day of Mercury, is always observed
by them with especial festivities. It
was they, say the peasants, who engraved
the mystic characters on the
Keltic stones of the Morbihan, and
especially those at Gawr-iniz, or the
Isle of the Giant. He who, like Taliessin,
could read them, would learn
all the places of their hidden treasure,
and to him all the secrets of science
would be revealed.</p>

<p>The dwarfs are less dreaded by the
country people than the fays, as being
rather comically mischievous than
wholly malicious. The peasant who
has taken the precaution to sprinkle
himself with holy-water passes fearlessly
by the lonely dolmen in the
solitudes which they haunt.</p>

<p>We were taught in our early youth
that it is to her white cliffs that Albion
owes her name; but M. de VillemarquÃ©
suggests that she is more probably
indebted for it to the god
Mercury, the Keltic Hermes, who
was the chief divinity worshipped by
the insular Britons, under the name
of <i>Gwion</i>. Their island was especially
placed under his protection, and
called for that reason the <i>Isle of
Gwion</i>, or of <i>Alwion</i>. The same
learned author remarks upon the apparent
identity of the Gwion of Britain
and the Gigon of the Tyrians
and Phoenicians, the divinity being
in each case revered as the god of
commerce, the inventor of letters,
and the patron of all the arts, and
represented in each case by the figure
of a dwarf carrying a purse.</p>

<p>The dwarfs of Brittany possess all
the attributes of Gwion, the heavy
purse included, and are evidently a
part of the Keltic mythology. It is
often difficult, and sometimes impossible,
to determine the date of poems
of which they form the subject. The
burden of the ballad of <i>Lord Nann</i>
comes down from the cradle of the
Indo-European nations, and, in numerous
localities, finds expression in
various forms. The one of which
we here give a translation probably
dates from the fifth or the sixth century.</p>

<p>The name <i>Nann</i> is the diminutive
of the Breton Reunan.</p>

<p>The foregoing ballad is reproduced
under no fewer than fifteen different
variations in Sweden and Denmark,
where it is entitled, <cite>Sire Olaf and the
Dance of the Elves</cite>. In its Servian
form of <cite>Prince Marko and the Wila</cite>,
the latter, instead of taking the life
of the hero, exacts both his eyes and
the four feet of his horse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Numerous as are the <i>traditions</i> relating
to the dwarfs, the <i>songs</i> of which
they are the subject are very rare.
The one we are about to give is apparently
intended as a satire upon
the tailors, that ill-used class which
in all warlike nations has been condemned
to ridicule. In Basse-Bretagne,
no one pronounces their name
without raising the hat, and adding,
"Saving your presence."</p>

<p>It will be remarked that the name
of Duz (diminutive, duzik) is, among
others, given to the dwarfs, which,
M. de VillemarquÃ© observes, was that
borne by the genii of Gaul in the
days of St. Augustine, who speaks
of them as "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">DÃ¦mones quos <i>Duscios</i>
Galli nuncupant</span>."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>It is said that a traveller being
upon one occasion drawn into their
circling dance, and finding the refrain
of "<i>dilun, dimeurs, dimerc'her</i>,"
etc., somewhat monotonous, ventured
to add the words <i>Saturday and Sunday</i>,
when the sudden explosion of
outcries, threatenings, and rage among
the assembly was so great that the
rash adventurer was half-dead with
fear. We are told that if only he
had added, "And so the week is
done," the long penitence to which
the dwarfs are condemned would have
ended.</p>

<p><cite>The Plague of Elliant</cite> commemorates
a frightful pestilence which, in
the sixth century, desolated not only
Armorica, but the whole of Europe.
Those who were attacked by it lost
their hair, their teeth, and their sight;
became yellow and languid, and speedily
died. The parish of Elliant, in Cornouaille,
was one of several from which
the whole population perished. The
neighboring country, especially that
around Tourc'h, was preserved from
the scourge by the prayers of a hermit
named Rasian.</p>

<p>We are told by M. de VillemarquÃ©
that the ballad of The <cite>Plague of Elliant</cite>
is never sung without the addition
of the following legend:</p>

<p>"It was the day of the <i>Pardon</i>
(the feast of the patron saint) at
Elliant; a young miller, arriving at
the ford with his horses, saw a fair
lady in a white robe seated on the
bank of the river, a little staff in her
hand, and who requested him to convey
her over the water. 'Oh! yes;
assuredly, madame,' replied he, and
already she was on his horse's crupper,
and soon deposited on the other
side. Then the fair lady said to him,
'Young man, you know not whom
you have brought over: I am the
Plague. I have just made the tour
of Brittany, and I go to the church
of the town, where they are ringing
for mass; all whom I strike with my
staff will quickly die; as for yourself,
fear nothing; no harm shall happen
to you, nor yet to your mother."</p>

<p>"And the Plague kept her word,"
adds the Breton peasant; for does not
the song itself say that none but</p>

<p class="center">
"A widow poor of sixty, and her only son, are left?"<br />
</p>

<p>The following is most probably only
a fragment of the original:</p>


<p class="center">THE PLAGUE OF ELLIANT.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>There is no surer remedy, in the
estimation of the Breton peasantry,
against an epidemic than to make a
song about it. "The Plague, finding
herself discovered, fled away." Thus,
as one among many examples of the
practical utility of the popular poetry,
we find that when, some years ago,
Brittany was severely visited by the
cholera, no attention was paid to the
printed circulars which were issued by
medical and magisterial authority; all
the preparation made by the people to
meet it was <i>to dig an extra number of
graves</i>, until a popular poet put into
verse the good advice concerning preventives
and remedies which, when
placarded in official prose, had been
passed by with no more notice than
a grave and incredulous shake of the
head. But a week after the composition
of the "Song upon the Cholera"
it was heard in every remote hamlet
or farm throughout Brittany. The
verses in themselves were detestable,
in the way of poetry; no matter, the
cholera, finding itself the subject of a
song, would take flight. From the
power attributed by the people to
poesy arises the Breton proverb,
"Poesy is stronger than the three
strongest things: stronger than evil,
than tempest, or than fire." And
again, "Song is the calmer of all sorrow."
All the Keltic poems, which,
like <cite>The Plague of Elliant</cite>, are written
in strophes, are sung throughout to
some national air, however lengthy
they may be. "I remember," writes
M. Ãmile Souvestre, "that one day,
arriving at the <i>Pardon</i> of St. Jean du
Doigt, near Morlaix, I heard a blind
man who was singing Breton verses
on the Nativity: in passing by again
in the evening, I found him still in the
same place, continuing his subject,
which was by no means concluded,
and which, he informed me, it required
an entire day to get through,
though he did not yet know the
whole."</p>

<p>It is impossible to compute the
number of the popular poems of Brittany.
The author just quoted considers
that eight or ten thousand would
not reach the reality; and he proceeds
to describe the manner in which they
mingle with the very <em>air</em> of the country,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No words can do justice to the intoxicating
sensation which he who understands our
old language experiences, when, on a fine
summer evening, he traverses the mountains
of Cornouaille, listening to the songs of the
shepherds. At every step the voice, perhaps
of a child, perhaps of an aged woman,
sends forth to him from the distance a fragment
of some antique ballad, sung to melodies
such as are never now composed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
narrating the miracle of a former time, or a
crime committed in the valley, or an attachment
which has broken the heart. The
couplets answer one another from rock to
rock; the verses sport in the air like the insects
of the evening; the wind carries them
by gusts into your face, with the perfume of
the black-wheat and the rye; and, immersed
in this poetic atmosphere, enchanted and
meditative, you advance into the midst of
the rural solitudes. You perceive great
Druidic stones, clothed with moss, leaning
toward the border of the wood; feudal ruins,
half-hidden in the thickets or breaking the
slope of the hills, while at times, on the
heights of the mountain, figures of men, with
long hair flying in the wind, and strangely
clad, pass like shadows between you and
the horizon, marked out against the sky,
which is just beginning to be illumined by the
rising moon. It is like a vision of bygone
times; like a waking dream that one might
have after reading a page of Ossian."</p></blockquote>

<p>We will close our present article
with a translation of the SÃ´ne of Per
CÃ¶atmor, as promised in our last; hoping
in a future one to conclude our notice
of the more ancient and "learned"
poetry of Brittany, that is, that
which was composed according to the
bardic rules, with some curious fragments
relating to Merlin the Magician
and Merlin the Bard; to be followed

<h2>GERALD GRIFFIN.</h2>


<p>In October, 1823, there arrived in
the city of London a young man from
the south of Ireland, unknown and
without a friend in that vast metropolis.
A stranger in a strange land,
he brought with him nothing but a
cultivated mind, a fresh, vigorous constitution,
a pleasing address, a spirit
of self-reliance amounting almost to
a morbid dislike for every thing savoring
of patronage, a slender purse, and
a few manuscript plays, the labor of
boyhood's leisure hours. His experience
of life had been confined to
his own peaceful household on the
banks of the Shannon, and the society
of a few intimate friends of his
family. His contributions to literature
amounted simply to some sketches
published in the newspapers of his
native city, Limerick, and the, to him,
precious burden he bore with him in
this his first adventure into the unknown
world. Thus provided, he aspired
with all the glorious confidence
of youthful ambition to no less a mission
than the reformation of the modern
drama, and the infusion of moral
sentiment into works of fiction, even
then fast acquiring those deleterious
qualities which so thoroughly permeate
them in our day.</p>

<p>This young literary knight-errant
was Gerald Griffin, who, born on the
12th day of December, 1803, had not
yet completed his twentieth year. The
story of his early life, as told by the
pen of an affectionate brother, is remarkable
principally for the calm,
holy atmosphere of parental love by
which it was surrounded, and the judicious
mental training to which he
was subjected even from his earliest
infancy. His father, Patrick Griffin,
a descendant of an ancient Irish family,
seems to have occupied a social
position equally removed from penury
and affluence; such a one, at least, as
enabled him to support his large family
with comfort, and provide each
of his children with an education not
only suitable to their condition, but
more extensive and varied than at
that time was considered necessary
for the sons and daughters of the
middle class. He was a man of
robust constitution, facile temper, an
ardent nationalist, and well read in
the history and antiquities of his
country. His mother, a woman of
more than ordinary cultivation and
great religious fervor, was entirely devoted
to her household duties and the
moral training of her children, and we
cannot better convey an idea of the
character of this admirable woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
than by transcribing the following
extract from one of her letters to
her son:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have, my dear Gerald, travelled with
you through your mortifying difficulties, and
am proud of my son&mdash;proud of his integrity,
talents, prudence, and, above all, his appearing
superior to that passion of common
minds, revenge; I must own, fully provoked
to it by &mdash;&mdash;'s conduct. I hope, however,
they may soon have to seek you, not you
them. Perhaps, after all, it may have been
as well that we did not know at the time
what you were to endure on your first outset.
We should in that case have been advising
you to come out here, which perhaps
would have been turning your back on that
fame and fortune which I hope will one day
reward your laudable perseverance and industry.
When the very intention you mention
of paying us a visit delights me so much,
what should I feel if Providence should have
in reserve for me the blessing of once again
embracing my Gerald?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Gerald united in himself the leading
characteristics of both parents in
a remarkable degree. His love of
home forms the constant theme of
his letters, while his attachment to
country and delicate moral sense
may properly be said to have tinged
every page of his prose, and inspired
every line of his poetry. His brothers
and sisters, eight in number, were
equally worthy of such progenitors,
and of the author of <cite>The Collegians</cite>;
the former becoming distinguished
members of the liberal professions,
and the latter, in most instances,
adopting the habits and worthily
fulfilling the duties of a religious
life.</p>

<p>When the young Gerald was about
seven years old, his father, abandoning
business in Limerick, removed some
miles from that city, and settled on a
farm pleasantly situated near the confluence
of the little river Oavaan and
the Shannon. Here the future novelist
and poet spent ten of the happiest
years of his life. Surrounded on all
sides by scenery the most picturesque,
wood, mountain, lake, and river, his
youthful imagination, so susceptible
of impressions of physical as well as
moral beauty, found ample scope.
Reserved in manner even with his
playmates, he was wont to shun their
society, and wander alone for hours
through the fields or by the riverside,
his gun or fishing-rod unused, and his
whole being drinking in the beauties
of the ever-varying landscape, or gazing
wonderingly on the distant "lovely
hills of Clare," the boundary of his
world. His love for the supernatural
and his fondness for fairy lore were
early developed in this sylvan retreat,
where every ruin had its tragic history,
every graveyard its especial ghost, and
every rath and cairn its appropriate
legend. How far such constant communings
with nature had a tendency
to disqualify him for the stern battle
of life which he was destined afterward
to wage with such varying fortune,
we cannot undertake to say; but
doubtless often, when in poverty and
exile, the recollection of those years
so tranquilly and innocently spent
must have brightened many a solitary
hour, and it is certain that to
this early development of a taste for
moral beauty we are indebted for
some of the most vivid and truthful
of his word-paintings.</p>

<p>But his mind was not altogether
occupied in contemplation. His education,
begun in Limerick, was assiduously
continued in the country under
the direction of a visiting tutor
and the older members of his family,
until at an early age he had mastered
not only the rudiments of the French
language, but had acquired a comparatively
extensive and accurate knowledge
of the English classics. He was
especially fond of poetry, and was
accustomed, even when a child, to
copy out passages from Goldsmith
and Moore; and his application to
his studies of all kinds was so intense
that he is described by his relatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
as being invariably in the habit
of sitting at his meals with a book
open before him, and two or three in
reserve ready to his hand. Goldsmith's
<cite>Animated Nature</cite> was one of his favorite
books, and he endeavored to turn
it to practical account by copying its
illustrations, and rearing with his own
hand numbers of the little song-birds
to be so plentifully found in the neighborhood.
In the year 1814, we find
him for a short time at the school of
a Mr. O'Brien, in Limerick, deep in
the fascinating pages of Horace, Ovid,
and Virgil, the latter of whom, as might
be expected, was his favorite poet, and
so earnestly did he explore this, to him,
new mine of poesy that he is said to
have attained a remarkable proficiency
in the Latin tongue at an age when
other children are but imperfectly
acquainted with their vernacular.
Though soon deprived of the valuable
supervision of Mr. O'Brien, he
continued his readings of the classics
for several years at a neighboring
school, and in maturer years evinced
in conversation and composition a
decided preference for this branch
of his early studies.</p>

<p>In 1820, the delightful family circle
at Fairy Lawn was broken up. Mr.
Griffin, senior, his wife and several of
their older children, emigrated to this
country, and settled near Binghamton,
in the State of New York. Gerald,
with one older brother and two younger
sisters, was left under the protection
of the oldest remaining brother, Dr.
William Griffin, then a practising physician
in Adare, a pretty village a few
miles from Limerick. The separation
from the two beings he loved best on
earth was a sad calamity for the affectionate
lad; but hope, that star which
always shone brightly for him no
matter how cloudy the horizon, consoled
him for what he believed to
be only a temporary bereavement.
"Gerald," says one of his sisters in
a letter to America, "has a biscuit
from your sea store, which he says
he will produce at the first meal we
eat together in Susquehanna." The
change of residence had one advantage,
however; for while it did not
interfere with his home studies, or
even with his rambles in search of
fresh scenery and old traditions, it
gave him an opportunity of often
visiting the city, and forming the
acquaintance of young men of congenial
tastes, principal among whom
was John Banim, one of the authors
of the celebrated <cite>Tales of the O'Hara
Family</cite>. He became also a frequent
attendant at such theatrical performances
as the place at that time afforded,
and even contributed reports,
sketches, verses, and leading articles
to the local journals, which, if they
were not very profitable or widely
known, "obliged him," he tells us,
"to write with quickness, and without
much study." But the young
man had already drunk too deeply
of the unpolluted waters of English
and Latin lore to be satisfied with
the superficial nothings of provincial
journalism, or to relish the crudities
of the dramatic pieces with which the
wandering players were then accustomed
to regale the unsophisticated
people of second-class cities. The
modern drama seemed to him flimsy
in its construction, and, if not positively
immoral, certainly in tendency
falling far short of its legitimate object,
which, as the great dramatist
tells us, "is and was to hold the
mirror up to nature," etc. He reflected
seriously on the possibility of
its reformation, and, like a true reformer,
zealously set to work to accomplish
this desirable purpose, encouraged
no doubt by the applause
which greeted the appearance of his
young countryman's <cite>Damon and Pythias</cite>.
He wrote about this time
three or four plays, none of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
were ever presented to the public;
and of the names and plots of all
but one we are ignorant. That was
called <cite>Aquire</cite>, and being a production
of considerable merit, judging
from the favorable opinion of it expressed
by Banim and other theatrical
critics to whose inspection it was confidentially
submitted, would very probably
have met with success on the
stage had not the author's over-sensitiveness
induced him to withdraw it
altogether, after endeavoring two or
three times to procure its representation.
His next step was to leave Ireland
for a wider sphere of action; but
it was only after repeated and urgent
solicitation, and upon reading over
this drama, which seemed to contain
many excellences, that his brother
and guardian, Dr. Griffin, consented
to gratify his longing to visit London,
where he felt he would have unlimited
scope to develop his idea of reform.
The consent gained, Gerald left home
for the first time, radiant with hope
and confident of success.</p>

<p>A youthful aspirant for literary
honors could not have made his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dÃ©but</i> at a more unpropitious time.
London was then, as now, the great
maelstrom which drew into its vortex
most of the enterprise and genius of
the three kingdoms, and, alas! proved
the grave of too many overwrought
and unappreciated minds. The fame
of Byron, Moore, and a host of contemporary
poets was then in its zenith,
and the refulgence of their genius
eclipsed the light of all lesser stars
which might have shone brightly in
any other atmosphere. The stage
was so completely neglected or debased
that the legitimate drama had
given place to spectacular frivolities,
and hundreds of plays of merit were
offered every year to the London
managers only to be rejected. The
wonderful success of Sir Walter Scott
as a novelist had produced a crowd
of plagiarists, as inferior in ability as
they were formidable in prolixity, who
had filled the shelves of the booksellers
with the veriest trash, and satiated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
nauseam</i> the public taste for romance.
Even the field of Irish fiction was apparently
fully occupied. Maria Edgeworth's
justly admired tales were in
every household, and the stronger and
brighter imagination of Banim had already
plumed its pinions, and tried
its first flight with marked success.
The era of patronage, when the great
and wealthy of the land esteemed it a
privilege to throw the Ã¦gis of their
protection over the artist and man of
letters, had passed away, perhaps happily,
for ever, and that of Bulwer and
Dickens, Thackeray and Lever had
not arrived; men whose magic pens
seem to have realized the alchemist's
dream, and turned every thing they
touched into gold. It was well for
the young adventurer that these difficulties
did not at once present themselves,
or, if discerned at all, it was
through that enchanting halo with
which youth surrounds the future.</p>

<p>On Gerald's arrival in London, his
first step was to procure respectable
lodgings; his next to place in the
hands of some person connected with
the stage, but whose name has not
transpired, a copy of one of his plays
for criticism and acceptance. This
person, though the only one to whom
the friendless lad was able to procure
an introduction, took the piece with
warm professions of friendship, and
promised it his early consideration;
but, after retaining it for some three
months, sent it back, "wrapped up in
an old newspaper," without a word
of comment, explanation, or apology.
The interval was one of painful suspense
for the aspiring writer, somewhat
relieved by the genial and unselfish
kindness of Banim, whose residence
in London he soon discovered.
Although having had but a slight acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
with Gerald, and being
himself very few years his senior, and
still on the threshold of fame, John Banim,
to his immortal credit be it said,
extended to his junior countryman
the hospitality of his house, and, what
was much more grateful, the sunshine
of his genial conversation and the refuge
of his cheerful fireside. He went
even further: with a total absence of
professional jealousy, he took <cite>Aquire</cite>,
read it over carefully, commended its
best passages, pointed out the errors
to be erased, the superabundant metaphor
and mere poetic imagery to be
pruned, and used all his efforts to
procure its representation. Gerald
was deeply grateful. "What would I
have done," he writes to his brother,
"if I had not found Banim? I should
never be tired of talking about and
thinking of Banim." It was at the suggestion
of this invaluable friend that, in
the early part of the following year, he
wrote <cite>Gisippus</cite>, and many of its most
striking scenes owe something to the
matured judgment of the author of
<cite>Damon and Pythias</cite>. This play, written,
as he tells us, on little slips of
paper in coffee-houses, though one
of great merit, for originality of
conception, dignity of language, and
startling incidents, was not acted till
two years after the author's death;
and when Macready at length introduced
it to the public, it was received
with great favor, and still, to use a
theatrical phrase, "keeps the boards."</p>

<p>But months passed wearily away in
the strange city, and Gerald's hopes
were as far as ever from fruition&mdash;months
spent in fruitless efforts to obtain
some sort of employment that
would enable him to support himself,
while he waited the pleasure of managers
and danced attendance on theatrical
committees. Again and again
he applied for the position of reporter
on the press, but was answered that
the places were all filled. He might
have become a police-news reporter,
but he was told that it was "hardly
reputable." He wrote for the literary
weeklies, but was cheated by every
one of them; he contributed to the
larger magazines, and his articles were
inserted; but when payment was requested,
"there was so much shuffling
and shabby work" that he left them
in disgust; he commenced the study
of Spanish, with a view to coÃ¶perate
with Valentine Llanos in the translation
of Spanish dramas; but Colburn
and the other publishers told him
that it was "entirely out of their line."
At last he undertook with avidity
to translate from the French a
volume and a half of one of Prevot's
works for two guineas&mdash;about ten and
a half dollars. It is no wonder, then,
that in the bitterness of his extremity
he wrote to his sister, "If I could
make a fortune by splitting matches,
I think I would never put a word in
print." Though practising the most
rigid economy, the occasional remittances
he received from his brother,
many of them unsolicited, did not
suffice for his ordinary wants; he was
compelled to give up his first lodgings
and seek others in a more obscure
part of the city, and was even
obliged to refuse the pressing invitations
of his friend Banim to meet Doctor
Maginn and other celebrities, at the
house of the former, for want of proper
apparel. "The fact is," he writes
home at this time, "I am at present
almost a complete prisoner. I wait
until dusk every evening to creep
from my mouse-hole, and snatch a little
fresh air on the bridge close by."</p>

<p>Staggering under the weight of disappointment
and poverty, he was yet
to encounter the additional torture of
ill health. Stooping constantly over
his desk, he contracted an affection
of the lungs, the unaccustomed dampness
of a London fog had given him
rheumatism, and he was occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
attacked with violent palpitations of
the heart, which endangered life itself.
The joyous spirit which had
soared like a bird beneath its native
skies on the banks of the Shannon,
drooped its wings in the heavy miasma
of the Thames; fagging, unrequited
labor made his days a burden
and his nights sleepless; his wardrobe
was so threadbare that for months at
a time he would not stir abroad in
the daylight, and consequently did
not meet the face of an acquaintance,
and his supply of food so meagre that
he was often obliged to dispense with
the commonest necessaries of life.
Indeed, so reduced had he become
in circumstances at this time that a
friend of his relates that, having lost
sight of him for several days, and apprehending
the true cause of his absence,
after long searching he discovered
him in a veritable garret, and, though
it was past midnight, still endeavoring
to work on his manuscripts. But
what must have been his astonishment
when he wrung from Gerald
the unwilling but unostentatious confession
that he had been without food
for three consecutive days? It is unnecessary
to say that his immediate
wants were supplied by the kind
friend who had thus timely visited
him, though not without some hesitation
on the part of the recipient of
the favor. Still, nothing could daunt
his indomitable will, no misfortune
could lessen the self-consciousness of
his ability to achieve ultimate success,
or break down his proud, too proud,
spirit of personal independence. He
might easily have obtained money
from his relatives in Ireland; but he
forebore to accept from them what
his susceptibilities led him to suppose
they could ill afford, and even his
true friend Banim, upon incidentally
discovering his situation and tendering
him in the most delicate manner
some pecuniary assistance, was met
with a decided and not over courteous
refusal. His enforced poverty likewise
had a very injurious effect on his
prospects as a dramatic author; for,
unable to mingle on an equality with
men connected with the stage, he lost
all chance of personal intercourse
with managers and critics, and finally
conceived such a distaste for or indifference
to his first affection, the
drama, that he relinquished for ever
the design of reforming the stage, the
hope that had lain nearest to his
heart and had prompted his self-imposed
exile from his native country.
Though few men loved literature
more for its own sake, or are, fortunately
generally called upon to offer
more sacrifices at its shrine, the vital
question with him had now become
narrowed down to the very one of
existence itself; for, to use his own
expression, "he preferred death to
failure."</p>

<p>Thus nearly two years passed away
in London, and, sick at heart and enfeebled
in body, he felt thousands and
thousands of times, as he writes to his
parents, that he could have lain down
quietly and died at once, and been
forgotten for ever. But in this his
darkest hour a ray of hope unexpectedly
crossed his gloomy path, and
with all the hopefulness of a rejuvenated
spirit he hailed it as the harbinger
of a new and more prosperous
epoch. A Mr. Foster, having accidentally
become acquainted with his
almost hopeless condition, procured
him employment at fifty pounds a
year as reader and corrector for a
publisher, and his gifted countryman
Maginn, immediately upon hearing
of his reduced circumstances, obtained
for him a situation on <cite>The Literary
Gazette</cite>, which soon led to a profitable
connection with other journals of a
like character. To all these he contributed
articles in prose and poetry
on every imaginable topic, and displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
such an adaptability and versatility
of talent that his services were
not only well rewarded by their respective
publishers, but very generally
appreciated by the reading community.
Many of the tales and sketches
which at this time came from his pen
were sent in and published anonymously,
or simply signed "Joseph," his
name in confirmation, so strictly did
he endeavor to preserve his incognito,
and trust to the intrinsic merits of his
contributions for their acceptance.
Though he wrote to his mother that
by reason of his new employment he
was enabled to pay off all the debts
he owed at the close of the year
1825, his varied productions could
not have been very remunerative,
certainly not in proportion to the
labor expended on them; for we find
him during the next session of Parliament
engaged as a reporter in the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>The vehemence with which he
seized hold of this opportunity, and
the ardor with which he pursued his
new calling as reporter and journalist,
show that he felt he had at last discovered
a clue that would lead him
out of the labyrinth of his difficulties,
and his success fully justified the confidence
in his own powers which had
never forsaken him. Opportunity, so
much desired by all young men of
ability, which comes to some unsought,
and as persistently flies the
approach of others, had at length
presented itself to Gerald Griffin, and
he lost no time in profiting by the
occasion. Association with authors
whose works he was obliged to examine,
criticise, and sometimes revise,
naturally led him to compare his own
capacity for production with theirs,
and to arrive at the conclusion that
he also was able to produce works of
prose fiction equally meritorious, and
as worthy the commendation of moralists
as epic poetry or the drama.
Satisfied on this point, he at once
relinquished his dramatic aspirations,
and prepared himself with all the enthusiasm
of his nature to enter the
lists as a novelist. In his "small
room in some obscure court, near St.
Paul's," he called up the recollections
of past days, of the lovely Shannon,
the mountain ranges of Clare, the
wakes, fairs, and festivals of the Munster
peasantry, the humor, shrewdness,
pathos, and frolic he as a child
had witnessed, and perhaps to some
extent shared, and he resolved to
essay an Irish novel illustrative of
these familiar scenes. Having first
tried short stories for the literary
weeklies, and found them eagerly
read and highly appreciated, he commenced
a series of tales to be published
in book form, which he designed
to call <cite>Anecdotes of Munster</cite>, but
which were afterward known under
the general title of <cite>Holland-Tide</cite>.</p>

<p>Pending the appearance of this his
first continued effort, his labors were
as varied and as unremitting as ever&mdash;correcting
for the press the lucubrations
of unskilled writers, reviewing
in the weekly papers the various
books that the metropolitan publishers
were constantly inflicting on the
public, writing theatrical criticisms,
sketches, poetry, and political articles&mdash;doing
any thing and every thing, in
fact, no matter how foreign to his
tastes, as long as they honorably secured
him present competency and a
reasonable prospect of finally accomplishing
his grand purpose. At one
time he describes himself as busy revising
a ponderous dictionary; at another,
collecting materials for a pamphlet
on Catholic emancipation. Now
he is promised Â£50 for a piece for the
English opera, and again he acknowledges
the receipt of several pounds
for reports furnished a Catholic newspaper
recently started. His leisure
moments, if he can be said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
had any, were devoted to versification,
while his parliamentary duties
kept him out of bed till three, and
sometimes five o'clock in the morning.
His brother William, who visited
him in London in 1826, thus describes
his altered appearance and his methodical
manner of life:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I had not seen him since he left Adare,
and was struck with the change in his appearance.
All color had left his cheek, he
had grown very thin, and there was a sedate
expression of countenance unusual in one so
young, and which in after years became habitual
to him. It was far from being so,
however, at the time I speak of, and readily
gave place to that light and lively glance of
his dark eye, that cheerfulness of manner
and observant humor, which from his very
infancy had enlivened our fireside circle at
home. Although so pale and thin as I have
described him, his tall figure, expressive features,
and his profusion of dark hair, thrown
back from a fine forehead, gave an impression
of a person remarkably handsome and interesting....
He was indefatigable
at his work; rose and breakfasted early, set
to his desk at once, and continued writing
till two or three o'clock in the afternoon;
took a turn round the park, which was close
to his residence; returned and dined; usually
took another walk after dinner, and returning
to tea, wrote for the remainder of
the evening, after remaining up to a very
late hour."</p></blockquote>

<p>The series of tales, published by
Simpkin and Marshall late in this
year brought Griffin Â£70 sterling,
and at once established his reputation
as a powerful and original
writer, and an accurate delineator of
Irish peasant character. Its reception
by the public and the gentlemen
of the critical profession was so generally
favorable that, feeling assured he
had at length entered on the right
road to distinction, and that his future
was no longer doubtful, Griffin
gave up his various engagements with
the press, and not unwillingly, it is to
be presumed, laid down for ever the
load of literary drudgery which had
so long bowed his spirit to the
earth. His fortitude had been severely
tested, not by one great calamity,
but by a series of trials, harder to be
borne, and had remained unshaken;
his constancy of purpose had been
proof against all allurements to swerve
from the honorable pursuit of letters;
and it is not too much to affirm, on
the authority of many who knew him
intimately, that his moral character
remained unsullied amid all the temptations
which usually beset a young
man of his isolated condition in every
large city. His first success was naturally
followed by a desire to revisit
his home, a wish in which he had
long secretly indulged, but which
was now strengthened by intelligence
of the dangerous illness of a favorite
sister. He arrived at Pallas Kenry,
his brother's residence, in February,
1827, but unfortunately a few hours
after the death of this young lady, an
event which, coupled with his feeble
health, destroyed for a time the pleasure
which he had anticipated from a
trip to Ireland, and the renewal of
his acquaintance with those peaceful
scenes the remembrance of which had
so cheered his absence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I started for Limerick at a very early
hour to meet him," says his brother, "and I
cannot forget how much I was struck by the
change his London life had made in his appearance.
His features looked so thin and
pale, and his cheeks so flattened, and, as it
were, bloodless, that the contrast with what
I remembered was horrid; while his voice
was feeble, and slightly raised in its pitch,
like that of one recovering from a lingering
illness. It was affecting, in these circumstances,
to observe the sudden and brilliant
light that kindled in his eyes on first seeing
me, and the smile of welcome that played
over his features and showed the spirit within
unchanged."</p></blockquote>

<p>The unremitting attention of his
relatives, however, at length assuaged
his mental grief and bodily sufferings,
and his mind, naturally resigned, gradually
resumed its wonted tranquillity.
He spent the summer months at Pallas
Kenry in the undisturbed enjoyment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
of home, but still industriously
occupied with his pen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When engaged in composition, (says his
biographer,) he made use of a manifold
writer, with a style and carbonic paper,
which gave him two and sometimes three
copies of his work. One of these he sent to
the publisher, the others he kept by him, in
case the first should be lost. He had his
sheets so cut out and arranged that they
were not greater in size than the leaf of a
moderate-sized octavo, and he wrote so
minute a hand that each page of the manuscript
contained enough matter for a page
of print. This enabled him very easily to
tell how much manuscript was necessary to
fill three volumes. His usual quantity of
writing was about ten pages of these in the
day. It was seldom less than this, and I
have known it repeatedly as high as fifteen
or twenty, without interfering with those
hours which he chose to devote to recreation.
He never rewrote his manuscript,
and one of the most remarkable things I
noticed in the progress of his work was
the extremely small number of erasures or
interlineations in it, several pages being
completed without the occurrence of a single
one."</p></blockquote>

<p>The result of this diligent application
was the first series of <cite>Tales of
the Munster Festivals</cite>, embracing <cite>The
Half-Sir</cite>, <cite>The Card Drawers</cite>, and <cite>The
Shuil Dhuv</cite>, with which he proceeded
to London, and which he disposed of
to his publishers for Â£250, a price that
would now be considered totally inadequate,
but which forty years ago
was looked upon as ample remuneration
for that species of labor. The
work, though decidedly superior to
<cite>Holland-Tide</cite>, was much less favorably
received by the critics, and Griffin
had now to pay the penalty of success
by having the children of his
brain held up to public censure, as
not being formed true to nature, or
as acting in a manner contrary to the
canons of London society. Though
such strictures generally emanated
from persons who either would not
or could not understand the peculiarities
of the people of Ireland,
he felt keenly alive to their praise or
censure, particularly the latter; nor
does he seem to have exhibited that
callousness which his long acquaintance
with the press, and the class of
men who are sometimes permitted to
sit in judgment on their superiors,
might have taught him.</p>

<p>Having remained long enough in
London to superintend the publication
of the tales, he gladly returned
to Pallas Kenry, where he spent
nearly a year in the undisturbed society
of his relatives and a few friends
living in his neighborhood. These
latter must have been few indeed, for
he is described as still of a very shy
and reserved disposition, except when
among intimate friends; and though
shown every mark of esteem and hospitality
by his countrymen, he had so
great an abhorrence of being lionized
that he seldom accepted invitations,
save such as could not in ordinary
politeness be rejected. Not that his
temper was soured or that his conversational
powers were deficient, but
home was to him the centre and only
object of attraction. "Would you
wish to view at a distance our domestic
circle?" asks his sister in one of
her letters to America. "William and
I are generally first at the breakfast
table, when, after a little time, walks
in Miss H&mdash;&mdash;; next Mr. Gerald, and,
last of all, Monsieur D&mdash;&mdash;. After
breakfast our two doctors go to their
patients; Gerald takes his desk by
the fire-place and writes away, except
when he chooses to throw a pinch or
a pull at the ringlets, cape, or frill of
the first lady next to him, or gives us
a stave of some old ballad."</p>

<p>Under such sweet influences, so different
from his wretched life in London,
the greater part of his best work, <cite>The
Collegians</cite>, was written. Two or three
subjects for a successor to <i>Shuil Dhuv</i>
had been selected and partly developed;
but having the fear of the critics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
before his eyes, he laid them aside
unfinished. The spring and summer
of 1828 thus passed away fruitlessly;
but at length a theme presented itself
that satisfied his judgment, and he set
about writing on it with all possible
expedition. <cite>The Collegians</cite> was originally
published in three volumes,
one and a half of which Griffin brought
with him to London in November.
The remaining portion was written in
that city in such hot haste that he
was obliged frequently to deliver his
sheets of manuscript without having
time to reread or revise them. This
work, on its first appearance, was received
with the greatest favor; it
placed the author at once at the head
of the novelists of his own country,
and gave him a high rank among the
writers of the English language&mdash;a
verdict which the experience of posterity
has fully confirmed.</p>

<p>Of the writers of that day Griffin's
favorite, as might be expected, was
Sir Walter Scott. He had a profound
respect for the historical romances of
that great man, and, with an ambition
honorable to his patriotism, he resolved
to abandon for a time the portraiture
of local and modern life, and
attempt to do for his native country
what the author of <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> had so
admirably done for Great Britain.
Accordingly, in the spring of 1829,
he removed to Dublin, where he spent
several months in the study of ancient
history and in visiting on foot several
parts of Ireland, the topography of
which he designed to introduce into
his new work. The fruit of his antiquarian
labors was <cite>The Invasion</cite>, which
appeared during the winter of the
same year, a short time after the publication
of a second series of <cite>Munster
Festivals</cite>. But though it had an extensive
sale and was highly praised
by the more learned, it did not, from
the very nature of the subject and the
remote epoch treated, establish itself
in the affections of the public so generally
as his previous and subsequent
writings. While in the Irish capital, he
was introduced to Sir Philip Crampton
and other distinguished scholars,
from all of whom he experienced the
most flattering attention. His fame,
indeed, had preceded him among all
classes of his countrymen, and their
warm and discriminating encomiums,
diffident as he was to a fault, must
have fallen pleasantly on his ear, and
not the less so when they were expressed
in the mellifluous accents he
was accustomed to hear from his
infancy. A closer intimacy with the
congenial spirits of his own country appears
to have worn off a great deal of
his natural reserve; for we now find
him mentioning that he had met Miss
Edgeworth, and was anticipating the
pleasure of an introduction to Lady
Morgan and other contemporary celebrities.
In the latter part of this year
he also formed the acquaintance of a
lady residing in the south of Ireland,
which soon ripened into a lasting
friendship, founded upon similarity of
tastes and mutual esteem. The name
of the lady is not given in his life, and
we know her only as the recipient of
several pleasant gossiping letters, addressed
to her by the initial "L.," and
by the many beautiful poems dedicated
in her honor. A married lady,
the mother of a numerous family, and
Griffin's senior by several years, she
exercised a wholesome and judicious
influence over a mind naturally sympathetic
but peculiarly sensitive, such
as none of his own sex could or would
have attempted. In company with
her husband and relatives he made a
prolonged visit to Killarney, the romantic
beauty of whose lakes filled
him with the most intense delight.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1829, he was again
in London, which city he was obliged
to visit each succeeding year till 1835,
to attend to his subsequent works; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span><cite>The
Christian Physiologist</cite>, <cite>The Rivals</cite>, <cite>The
Duke of Monmouth</cite>, and <cite>Tales of My
Neighborhood</cite>, appearing in nearly regular
annual succession. The intervening
time was generally spent in acquiring
material for these works, or at
the watering-places enjoying his well-earned
repose. It was on the occasion
of one of those flying trips across
the channel, in 1832, that, being requested
by the electors of Limerick
to present, on their behalf, a request
to Moore that he would consent to
represent them in Parliament, Griffin
deviated from his route and called
on that celebrated poet at Sloperton
Cottage. In a playful account of
this ever-memorable interview, addressed
to his friend "L.," he says:
"O dear L&mdash;&mdash;! I saw the poet,
and I spoke to him, and he spoke to
me, and it was not to bid me to 'get
out of his way,' as the king of France
did to the man who boasted that his
majesty had spoken to him; but it
was to shake hands with me, and to
ask me, 'How I did, Mr. Griffin,' and
to speak of 'my fame.' <em>My</em> fame!
Tom Moore talk of my fame! Ah
the rogue! He was humbugging,
L&mdash;&mdash;, I'm afraid. He knew the soft
side of an author's heart, and perhaps
had pity on my long, melancholy-looking
figure, and said to himself, 'I
will make this poor fellow feel pleasant,
if I can;' for which, with all his
roguery, who could help liking him
and being grateful to him?"</p>

<p>In 1838, he projected a tour on the
continent; but was induced to change
his purpose for a shorter one in Scotland,
from which he derived not only
great pleasure, but restored health.
His diary of the trip, originally taken
in short-hand notes, has been published,
and abounds in good-natured
criticisms on the manners and customs
of the people he met on his journey,
and some very fine descriptions of the
scenery of the Highlands, which fell
under his observation.</p>

<p>Gerald Griffin's last novel, as we
have intimated, appeared in 1835,
when only in the thirty-second year
of his age. He had succeeded in the
fullest sense as a novelist, in giving to
the world in half a score of years
some of the healthiest and most fascinating
books in our language; had
won the applause of the gifted and
good alike, and, in a pecuniary point
of view, had secured himself against
all probability of dependence. Still,
in a certain sense, he was not content.
The pursuit of fame, as he had on
more than one occasion predicted,
had alone given him pleasure&mdash;its
acquisition brought him no permanent
satisfaction. Whether in abandoning
the drama he had departed
from his true path, or that his early
insight into the mysteries of authorship
had led him to underrate the
labors of those whom the world is
allowed to know only at a distance,
or that his mind, naturally of a serious
and religious turn, now fully developed,
instinctively arrived at the
conviction that only in the performance
of those duties and sacrifices
imposed on the ministers of the Gospel
could be found his real sphere of
action, or whether all these causes
acted upon him with more or less
force, certain it is that he now began
to contemplate a radical change in
his life. We know that he relinquished
writing for the stage with
reluctance, and that as early as 1828
he commenced the study of law at
the London University; but it was
not for two or three years afterward
that his friends noticed his growing
inclination for the life of a religious.
From that time his poems, those beautiful
scintillations of his soul, began
to exhibit a higher fancy and a purer
moral power than could be drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
even from patriotism, or the contemplation
of mere natural objects. His
conversation assumed a graver tone,
and his letters to his friends, formerly
so pleasantly filled with gossip
and scraps of comment on the
persons and literature of the day, were
mainly taken up with graver topics.</p>

<p>This change, we are satisfied, was
the effect of grave and due deliberation,
and not the result of caprice or
disappointed ambition. It had been
remarked that his letters to the different
members of his family during
his residence in London, while filled
with minute details of his literary
labors, fears, and aspirations, seldom
touched on religious matters, and
hence it has been inferred that during
his sojourn there he had neglected
the practical duties of the faith of his
boyhood; but this supposition is altogether
gratuitous. In familiar intercourse
with men of his own age and
pursuits, he may have given expression
to crude or speculative opinions
without that proper degree of reverence
which older minds exercise in
dealing with such important questions;
but we have the assurance of
his nearest relatives and of those few
who enjoyed his friendship that this
weakness was seldom indulged in.
However, Griffin in a spirit of self-condemnation,
which we cannot help
thinking disproportionate to the supposed
offence, inaugurated his new
mode of life by endeavoring to remove
from the minds of his former
associates any wrong impressions
such conversations might have produced.
In an admirable letter written
to a literary friend in London,
under date January 13th, 1830, he
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since our acquaintance has recommenced
this winter, I have observed, with frequent
pain, that not much (if the slightest)
change has taken place in your opinions on
the only important subject on earth. Within
the last few weeks, I have been thinking
a great deal upon this subject, and my conscience
reproaches me that you may have
found in the worldliness of my own conduct
and conversation reason to suppose that
my religious convictions had not taken that
deep hold of my heart and mind which they
really have. I will tell you what has convinced
me of this. I have compared our
interviews this winter with the conversations
we used to hold together, when my
opinions were unsettled and my principles
(if they deserved the name) detestable, and
though these may be somewhat more decent
at present, I am uneasy at the thought
that the whole tenor of my conduct, such as
it has appeared to you, was far from that
of one who lived purely and truly for heaven
and for religion."</p></blockquote>

<p>With a short visit to Paris and his
tour in Scotland, Griffin practically
bade adieu to the outside world, and,
retiring to Pallas Kenry, prepared
himself for admission into the order
of the Christian Brothers. We
learn from one of his letters to friends
in America that he had at first designed
to offer himself as a candidate
for the holy ministry, and had even
commenced a preparatory course of
theological study; but distrust of his
vocation for a calling requiring so
many qualifications led him to select
the more quiet but highly meritorious
sphere of a humble teacher of
little children.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I had long since relinquished the idea,"
he writes, "which I ought never to have
entertained, of assuming the duties of the
priesthood; and I assure you that it is one of
the attractions of the order into which I have
entered, that its subjects are prohibited (by
the brief issued from Rome in approval and
confirmation of the institute) from ever aspiring
to the priesthood."</p></blockquote>

<p>Having destroyed all his unpublished
manuscripts, including <cite>Matt
Hyland</cite>, a ballad of considerable
merit of which only a fragment remains,
and taken affectionate leave
of his friends, the author of <cite>Gisippus</cite>
and <cite>The Collegians</cite>, in the prime of
his manhood and the fulness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
fame, left his home for ever, entered
as a postulant the institute of the
Brothers of the Christian Schools in
Dublin, September 8th, 1838, and on
the 15th of the following month,
the feast of St. Teresa, was admitted
to the religious habit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have," he writes, "entered this house,
at the gracious call of God, to die to the
world and to live to him; all is to be changed;
all my own pursuits henceforward to
be laid aside, and those only embraced which
he points out to me."</p></blockquote>

<p>Gerald Griffin, or, as we must
henceforth know him, Brother Joseph,
entered on the performance of
his new duties with his characteristic
ardor and in a spirit of unostentatious
obedience, which elicited the admiration
of the community to a greater
extent than the display of mere intellectual
accomplishments could have
done. "Nothing," said the superior
general of the order, "could exceed
the earnestness with which he discharged
every duty; nothing was
done by halves; nothing imperfectly;
he seemed as if he had nothing else
to do but that which he was doing."
The following extract from a letter
written soon after his removal to the
North Cork monastery, the succeeding
year, while it shows a touch of
his old playful style, illustrates also
that cheerfulness of spirit which so
preÃ«minently marks the character of
the members of all the religious orders
of the church, the result of the
consciousness of useful labor well
done:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was ordered off here from Dublin last
June, and have been since enlightening the
craniums of the wondering Paddies in this
quarter, who learn from me with profound
amazement and profit that o x spells ox;
that the top of the map is the north, and
the bottom is the south, with various other
branches; as also that they ought to be
good boys, and do as they are bid, and say
their prayers every morning and evening,
etc.; and yet it seems curious, even to myself,
that I feel a great deal happier in the
practice of this daily routine than I did
while I was roving about your great city,
absorbed in the modest project of rivalling
Shakespeare and throwing Scott into the
shade."</p></blockquote>

<p>From this time till his death, which
took place a year after his removal
from Dublin, Brother Joseph remained
in the North Cork monastery, his
time divided between teaching the
children of the poor and in that inner
preparation for the end so unexpectedly
near at hand, and to which he
no longer looked forward, as he once
had done, with apprehension. Until
a very short time before his demise,
he was in excellent health, and his
conduct was marked by that serenity
of manner and cheerfulness of speech
which showed that the tempest-tossed
spirit had at length found a haven
of refuge. He visited his home but
once, and then for a brief period, returning
without pain or regret to his
prayers and studies, among the latter
of which was the compilation of a
series of pious tales, intended for the
use of the Brothers' schools, but which
were never completed. His death, the
result of typhus fever which set in on
the 31st of May, and terminated fatally
twelve days after, is thus simply but
tenderly described by the director of
novices, who was one of the witnesses
of the edifying scene:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the morning of the day when his
last illness took an unfavorable turn, he
called the person in attendance on him to
his bedside, and quietly told him 'he
thought he should die of this sickness, and
that he wished to receive extreme unction.'
His confessor, by a merciful dispensation
of providence, was then in the house, and
expressed his opinion that, as a matter of
precaution, it was best to administer it.
He repaired to his bedside, presented him
the holy viaticum, and administered extreme
unction. He received them with the most
lively sentiments of love and resignation, as
well as the utmost fervor and devotion. During
his illness, not a murmur or sigh of impatience
escaped him; not a sentiment but
breathed love, confidence, and resignation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
not a desire but for the perfect accomplishment
of the will of Him to whom his habits of
prayer had so long and closely united him."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus lived and died one whom it
would be faint praise to call one of
the brightest and purest ornaments
which this century has given to English
literature. The various creations
of his fancy will long hold a high
place in the hearts of all who admire
the beautiful and revere the good;
but the moral of his own life is the
noblest heritage he has left us. True
to the instincts of his Catholic birth
and training, he passed through the
temptations of sorrow, poverty, and
vanities of a great city for years, preserving
his faith unshaken and his
morals unsullied; with courage and
tenacity of purpose, the attributes of
true heroism, he surmounted obstacle
after obstacle, which might easily
have daunted older and stronger men,
till he reached a proud position in
the literature of his country; and when
surrounded by all that is supposed to
make life valuable&mdash;personal independence,
devoted friends, and worldly
applause&mdash;he gently and after
mature self-examination took off his
laurels, laid them modestly on the
altar of religion, and, clothed in the
humble garb of a Christian Brother,
prepared to devote his life to unostentatious
charity. Even his very
name, that he once fondly hoped to
write on the enduring tablets of history,
he no longer desired to be remembered;
for on the plain stone
that marks his last resting-place in
the little graveyard of the monastery
is engraved simply the words,</p>

<h2>THE FIRST &OElig;CUMENICAL COUNCIL OF THE VATICAN.<br />

<small>NUMBER FIVE.</small></h2>


<p>For another month the Vatican
Council has pursued the path originally
marked out for its labors with
a calmness and steady perseverance
which no outside influences can disturb.
In the beginning of its sessions
sensational correspondents described
what they saw and what they did not
see&mdash;praised, mocked, or maligned
as their humors led them or as their
patrons desired, and poured forth
abundant streams of amusing anecdotes,
acute guesses, and positive assurances.
The correspondence of one
week was found to contradict that of
the preceding week, and was itself
contradicted the week following.
Now, though wit, and drollery, and
sarcasm may please for a time, human
nature, after all, desires truth. And
as men saw these contradictions, they
came to understand how thoroughly
untrustworthy were these correspondents;
and the writers, ever on the
alert to catch the first symptoms of
popular feeling, have, in great part,
dropped the subject. The only influence
which such writings as these
have had on the prelates of the council
was to supply them with abundant
topics for amusement in their hours of
relaxation.</p>

<p>Another class of writers have all
along treated, and still continue to
treat, of the council and its action
with earnestness of purpose, and are
making strenuous efforts to guide
and control or to check its course on
subjects which they believe to have
come or which may come up before
it. We speak of those who are moved
by religious or political feelings. Day
after day and week after week, Italian,
French, German, and English
newspapers are taking one side or
the other on these subjects, and write
on them, if they do not always discuss
them. At times you may find
an article learned, well written, replete
with thought, and suggestive, perhaps
instructive. But generally the articles
are only such as may be looked for
in a newspaper&mdash;superficial and with
an affectation of smartness. However
their brilliancy, ofttimes only
tinsel, may please their world of readers,
among the bishops in the council
they have, and can have, no weight
whatever. It would, indeed, be surprising
if they had.</p>

<p>Beyond the papers, there come
pamphlets, many of them ably and
learnedly written. It is to be lamented
that too often the writers have
allowed themselves to be carried away
by excitement, and to use language
which calls for censure. Still, they
profess to discuss the questions gravely,
and to present the strongest arguments
in favor of their respective
sides. We will not say that such
writings are not privately read and
maturely weighed by the fathers, and
in fact carefully studied, so far as they
may throw light on subjects of doctrine
or discipline to be examined.
But they certainly have not had the
power to accelerate or retard, by a
single day, the regular course of business
before the council.</p>

<p>Some weeks ago, the papers of Europe
were filled with articles announcing
the approaching action of several
governments, and the measures they
would take to influence the pope and
the bishops, so as to control their action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
by the apprehension of possible
political results. What precise amount
of truth and what amount of exaggeration
there was in the vast mass of
excited utterances on this subject, we
are not yet able to say. Perhaps it
may hereafter be discovered in sundry
green books, red books, and yellow
books. This much is certain:
the council was not even flurried by
it. We are assured that in all the
debates not the slightest reference
was ever made to the matter. As we
write the whole subject seems to be
passing into oblivion. Even those
who spoke most positively only a few
weeks ago, seem to have forgotten
their assertions about the intended
interference of this, that, or the other
government.</p>

<p>There is a majesty in this calm attitude
of the sovereign pontiff, and of
the council, which does not fail to
command the respect even of worldlings
and unbelievers. They can with
difficulty, if at all, comprehend the
great truth on which it is based and
which produces it. The Catholic
would scarcely look for any other
attitude from our prelates. The bishops
of the Catholic Church, assembled
in council, are not politicians or
servants of the world, seeking popularity
or fearing the loss of it. They
fear not those who can slay only the
body, but Him who can slay both
body and soul. They are assembled,
in the name of Christ our Lord, to
do the work to which he appointed
them. They must proclaim his doctrines
and his precepts; they must
promote the extension of his kingdom,
and must zealously and unceasingly
seek the welfare and salvation
of souls for whom he shed his blood
on Calvary. They are men, and, as
subjects or citizens, they are bound
to give, and each in his own home
does give, unto CÃ¦sar all that is CÃ¦sar's.
But they are Christian bishops,
and they must not fail to give, and to
instruct and call on all men to give,
unto God the things that are God's.
Assembled in the Holy Ghost, they
do not seek to discover what is popular&mdash;what
may be pleasing or what
contrary to the opinions, or prejudices,
or passions of to-day, whether in the
fulsome self-adulation, because of our
vaunted progress, or in the intrigues
and plans of worldly politics and
national ambitions. They stand far
above all this folly, and are not plunged
into this chaos. They have to set forth
clearly the one divine truth of revelation,
which has been handed down
from the beginning, and which they
see now so frequently impugned and
controverted, or set aside and forgotten.
It is precisely because the world
is setting it aside, that this council has
met and will speak.</p>

<p>Our divine Saviour himself declared
that the world would oppose
the teachers of his truth as it had
opposed him. The history of the
eighteen hundred years of her existence
is, for the church, but a continuous
verification of that prophecy. The
fathers of the Vatican Council cannot
lose sight of the lesson thus given. It
should purify their hearts and strengthen
their souls. For they, of all men,
must believe most truly and earnestly
in the truth and the reality of Christianity
and the greatness of the work
in which they are engaged. Hence,
when the murmurs or the clamors of
the opposition of the world come to
their ears, they are not filled with fear
or with surprise. Of all miracles, they
would look on this as the greatest, that,
as the Vatican Council speaks, the passions
and earthly interests and prejudices
of men should at once die out
or grow mute, and that no voice
should be heard in opposition, no arm
be raised to arrest or thwart, if it
could, the work of God. This they
do not look for. Opposition must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
come, and they must not fear it, nor
shrink from encountering it while at
their post of duty. As they become
conscious of its approach, they can
but gird themselves the more energetically
to their work, and seek the
guidance and strength of which they
have need from on high.</p>

<p>When we closed our last article, the
prelates of the council were busily
engaged, in accordance with the new
by-laws, in writing out their observations
and criticisms on several draughts
that had been put into their hands.
This work, so far as then required,
was finished on March 25th. But on
the 18th, the meetings of the general
congregations, or committees of the
whole, were resumed, and have been
held since then on the 22d, 23d, 24th,
26th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st of
March, and April 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th,
7th, 8th, 12th, and 19th.</p>

<p>The business of the council has entered
on a new stage. Our readers
will remember that early in December
last the first draught or schema on matters
of faith was placed in the hands of
the bishops; and that after some
weeks of private study it was taken up
for discussion in the general congregation
held on the 28th of December.
In our second article we gave some
account of the character of this discussion,
in which no less than thirty-five
of the prelates took part. At its
conclusion the draught was referred for
emendations to the special committee
or deputation on matters of faith, to
which were also sent full reports of all
the discourses in the discussion. This
committee held many meetings, and
went over the whole matter two or
three times with the utmost care,
hearing the authors of the draught and
weighing the arguments and observations
made in the general congregations.
They divided the schema or
draught into two parts, and now reported
back the first part amended,
containing an introduction and four
chapters, with canons annexed.</p>

<p>This new and revised draught or
schema, so presented to the bishops&mdash;in
print, of course, as are all the conciliar
documents&mdash;was again to be submitted
to a renewed discussion and
examination, first in general on its
plan as a whole, and then by parts,
first on the introduction, and then successively
on each of the four chapters
which composed it. A member of
the deputation or committee on faith
opened the discussion by speaking as
the organ of the committee, and explaining
and upholding what they
had done. Many other fathers took
part in the lively discussions which
followed. The speeches were very
brief and to the point, only one of
them exceeding half an hour, and several
not lasting more than five minutes.
Those who wished to speak
sent in their names beforehand to the
presiding cardinals, as on former occasions,
and were called to the pulpit in
their regular order. The spokesman
of the committee, or, in fact, any other
member, might, during the course of
the debate, take the pulpit to give some
desired explanation or to reply to a
speaker. All who wished to propose
further amendments or changes were
required to hand them in in writing.
This the speakers generally did at the
conclusion of their discourses. When
at length the discussion on any special
part&mdash;for example, on the introduction&mdash;was
terminated, that portion
of the schema and all the proposed
amendments were referred again to
the committee. The amendments
were printed, and a few days after,
in a general congregation, the whole
matter would come up for a vote.
The committee announced which of
the amendments they accepted. They
stated briefly the reasons for which
they were unwilling to accept the
others. The fathers then voted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
each amendment singly, unless, indeed,
as sometimes happened, the author,
satisfied with the explanation
or replies given, asked leave to withdraw
it.</p>

<p>This chapter or portion of schema,
or draught, was then again printed, introducing
into it the amendments that
had been thus adopted; and it was
again submitted as a whole to the
vote of the fathers.</p>

<p>All these votes were taken without
unnecessary expenditure of time.
When a question was proposed, all in
the affirmative were called on to rise,
and to remain standing until their
number was ascertained. They then
sat down, and all in the negative were
in their turn summoned to rise, and
to remain standing until they were
counted.</p>

<p>As there are usually over seven
hundred prelates present and voting,
it is clear that if the numbers on each
side are nearly even, there might be
some difficulty in settling the vote.
But the evil did not occur. It so
happened that on every vote the
majority was so preponderating in
numbers that an actual count was
not necessary. It is said that only
on one occasion they were nearly
evenly divided. The important question
happened to be whether the insertion
of a certain comma between
two words in the text before them
would make the sense more distinct
or not. The division of sentiment
on so small a matter caused some
amusement; but it was evidence of
the painstaking care with which even
the minutest points are scrutinized and
cared for.</p>

<p>When the introduction and each
one of the chapters with its accompanying
canons had been thus separately
passed on, the entire schema
as a whole was submitted to the
fathers for a more solemn and decisive
vote. This was done in the
general congregations held on April
12th and April 19th. The vote was
taken, not, as in deciding on the details,
by the act of rising, but by ayes
and noes.</p>

<p>This was first done in the congregation
of the 12th, in the following manner:
The secretary from the lofty pulpit
called the prelates one after the
other, according to their ranks and
their seniority in their several ranks,
naming each one by his ecclesiastical
title. The cardinals presiding were
called first, the other cardinals next,
then the patriarchs, the primates, the
archbishops, the bishops, the mitred
abbots, and the superiors of the various
religious orders and congregations
having solemn vows. As each
prelate was called, he rose in his place,
bowed to the assembly, and voted.
The form was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placet</i>, if he approved
entirely; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placet juxta modum</i>, if there
were any minor point which he was
unwilling to approve; or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non placet</i>, if
he disapproved. In the second case,
he handed in a written statement of
his opinion and vote on that point,
and assigned the reasons which moved
him to this special view. The assessors
of the council immediately received
these manuscripts, and delivered
them to the presiding legates.
As the name of each one was called,
if not present, he was marked <i>absent</i>;
if present and voting, two or three of
the officials, stationed here and there
in the hall, repeated with clear bell-like
voices the form of words used by
the prelate in voting, so that all might
hear them, and that no mistake could
be committed as to any one's vote.
The whole procedure occupied about
two hours. When it was over, the
votes were counted before all, and the
result declared. This was in reality
the most solemn and formal voting
of the bishops on the matter so far
before them. Each one's judgment
is asked, and he must give it. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
evident the bishops voted after mature
study, and with an evident singleness
and simplicity of heart before God.</p>

<p>The special matters urged in the
written and conditional votes were
again, and for the last time, examined
by the committee or deputation on
matters of faith, they reported the result
of their discussion in the congregation
of April 19th, and the precise
form of words was settled, to be decreed
and published in the third
public session, which will be held on
Low-Sunday.</p>

<p>It thus appears that nothing will be
put forth by the council without the
fullest study and examination.</p>

<p>1. The <i>schemata</i>, or draughts, as presented
to the council, are the result
of the studies and conferences of able
theologians of Rome, and of every
Catholic country.</p>

<p>2. The <i>schema</i> is subjected to a
thorough debate before the general
congregation or, committee of the
whole, or under the by-laws, it is
placed in the hands of each one of
the bishops, and every one who
thinks it proper gives in writing his
remarks on it, and proposes his emendations.</p>

<p>3. The <i>schema</i>, and these remarks
and proposed amendments, are carefully
considered by the deputation
or committee to whom they are referred,
whose office it is to prepare
for the council a revised and amended
draught. The twenty-four members
of the <i>deputation</i> are picked men,
and the examination and discussion
of the subjects by them has proved
to be all that the fathers looked for&mdash;most
thorough and searching.</p>

<p>4. Again, on their revised report,
the matter is a second time brought
before the general committee, and is
again discussed by the fathers, who
are at liberty still to propose further
changes and amendments. As a matter
of fact, these turn mostly on minute
details and on forms of expression.</p>

<p>5. Again, in the light of those proposed
amendments, it is examined and
discussed by the committee, who make
their final report, accepting or not accepting
the several amendments, and
assigning to the congregation the reasons
for their decision on each point.
They thus enjoy the privilege of closing
the debate.</p>

<p>6. Then follows the voting. One
portion of the <i>schema</i> is taken up.
The amendments touching it, so reported
on by the committee, are one
by one either adopted or rejected, and
then the whole portion is passed on.
One after the other the remaining
portions are taken up, and acted on
in the same manner. The amendments
are first disposed of one by
one, and then each portion is separately
voted on. Finally, all the parts
as separately adopted are put together,
and on the whole <i>schema</i> so composed
a more solemn vote is taken by ayes
and noes.</p>

<p>This concludes the, so to speak,
consultative action of the council on
that <i>schema</i>. It is now ready for a
solemn enactment and promulgation
in the next public session of the council.
(This session was held on Low-Sunday.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.
C. W.</span>)</p>

<p>The time is approaching when the
first portion of the decisions and decrees
of the Vatican Council will be
given to the world in the third public
session, to be held on Low-Sunday.
Already enough has come to light, in
the better informed presses of Europe,
to let us know the general tenor of
what we shall soon hear. As it has
become a matter of notoriety, we may
speak of the subjects so said to be
treated of.</p>

<p>The state of the world, and the errors
and evils to be met and condemned
in this nineteenth century by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
the Vatican Council, are very different
from those which all previous councils
were assembled to resist. The heresies
then to be encountered denied
this or that doctrine in particular, and
erred on one or another point. But
they all admitted the existence of God,
the reality and truth, at least in a general
way, of a revelation from heaven
through Christ our Lord, and the
obligation of man to receive it, and to
be guided by it in belief and practice.
Now, the world sees but too many who
go far beyond that. Then, so to speak,
the outposts were assailed. Now the
very citadel of revelation is attacked.
Schools of a falsely called philosophy
have arisen which, with a pretended
show of reasoning, deny the existence
of God, of spiritual beings, of the soul
of man, and recognize only the existence
of physical matter. Or if they
speak of God, it is by an abuse of
terms, and in a pantheistic sense,
holding him to be only the totality
of all existing things, a personification
of universal nature; or else, if
they wish to be more abstruse or
more unintelligible, God is, according
to them, the primal being, a vague
and indefinite first substance, by the
changes, evolutions, emanations, and
modifications of which all existing
things have come to be as they are.
Many are the phases of materialism,
pantheism, and theopantism in which
German metaphysicians revel, and call
it high intellectual culture. The pith
of all of them is atheism, the denial
of the real existence of God.</p>

<p>The English mind is, or believes
itself to be, more practical and matter-of-fact.
It does not wander through
the dreamy mazes of German metaphysics.
It has no taste for such excursions.
But there is a school in
England which, under the pretence
of respecting facts, reaches practically
the same sad results. It tells its disciples
of what has been termed the
philosophy of the unknowable and
unintelligible, and declares that man,
possessed only of such limited powers
of knowledge as experience proves us
to have, cannot conceive, cannot really
know, cannot be made to know, any
thing of God, the self-existent and absolute,
eternal, infinitely wise and infinitely
perfect, and that these words are
merely conventional sounds, in reality
meaningless, and conveying no real
thought to the mind. Hence, he is
to be held at once the wisest philosopher
and most sensible man who discards
them altogether, who throws
aside all these useless, cloudy, unintelligible
subjects, and occupies himself
with the immediate and actual
world around him, of which alone,
through his senses, his experiments,
and his experiences, he can obtain
some certain and positive knowledge.
This they call independence and freedom
of science. In many minds it
would be pure atheism, if pure atheism
were possible; in many others, it
has produced and is producing a haziness
of doubt, and an uncertainty on
all these points touching the existence
and the attributes of God, as in practice
leads to almost the same result.</p>

<p>The French mind is active, acute,
sketchy, imaginative, logical, and practical.
On a minimum quantity of facts
or principles it will construct a vast
theory. If facts are too few to support
the theory, imagination can readily
supply all that are lacking. The
theory, if logically consistent, must be
reduced to practice; opponents must
stand aside or be crushed down. The
theory must rule. From the days of
Voltaire, if not before, France has seen
men deny religion under the guise of
teaching philosophy. The sarcasms,
and at times the brilliancy of their
writings, have made French authors
the store-house from which infidels in
other nations draw their weapons. It
was in France that a national decree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
enacted that there is no God, and it is
in France and in Belgium that the societies
of so-called <i>Solidaires</i> exist, the
members of which solemnly bind themselves
to each other to live and die,
and be buried, without any act of religion.
Too full of confidence in their
powers of mind to accept the English
system, and to acknowledge there is
any subject they cannot master; too
impressionable and practical to live in
the cloud of German metaphysical
pantheism, the French <i>philosophers</i>
are prone to deify man, instead of
universal nature. Whether they follow
Comte in his earlier theories, or
Comte in the very different theories
of his old age, or whether they devise
some other theory, it is generally man
they place on the throne of the Deity.
This worship of man, this spirit of humanitarianism,
and this belief in the
progressive and indefinite perfectibility
of mankind, which they hold
apart from and in antagonism to
the belief which worships God as
the Creator and Sovereign Lord, and
places man the creature subject to
him, runs practically through many
a phase of their character in modern
times.</p>

<p>These three systems&mdash;of course
more or less commingled in their
sources&mdash;have been extended to every
portion of the civilized world. The
German system has passed into Denmark,
Holland, and Sweden; the
French into Italy, Spain, and Portugal,
and in some measure through
them into Southern America. In the
United States, we have been comparatively
free from them. We owe it,
probably, to the fact that with us all
men are so busy trying to amass fortunes
that they have little time and less
taste for such abstruse speculations.
True, through the vast German immigration,
we have received some portion
of the German system. But so
far it has scarcely spread among our
citizens of other nationalities. The
English system, strange to say, scarcely
exists except in its vaguer influences.
The French system, introduced
years ago, has struck deeper
roots, and has a wider influence.
But, on the whole, the mass of our
people has a firm unshaken belief in
the real truth of Christianity as a revealed
religion. Although very often
men are exceedingly puzzled to know
what are the specific doctrines, still
they have not lost the traditions of
their fathers, and have not fallen into
positive unbelief. How long these
words will remain true, who can tell?
Luxury and the general demoralization
becoming so familiar, and the
systematic godless education of our
youth, will soon perhaps place us in
the van of those nations who seem
to have been given up to the foolishness
of their hearts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the church knows that
she is debtor to all&mdash;that her mission
is to preach the Gospel of Christ
to all nations. Seeing in what manner
so many are going astray, so far
as even to deny the God that made
them and redeemed them, and knowing
that he has sent her as a messenger
from him to them, she raises her
voice, and, in clear, steady, clarion
tones that will ring through the
world, she proclaims again that he is
the one true God, eternal and almighty,
the Creator whom all men
must know and must serve, and unto
whom they will all have to render a
strict account. This assembled council
is itself evidence, clear as the noon-day
light, of her existence, and her
office in the world. Men may not
shut their eyes to the fact. Her
words are clear: "He whom ye
deny exists, and speaks to you through
me. He whom ye scoff at is your
Creator and Lord, from whom ye have
received all that ye have. He whom
ye deride is long-suffering, and wills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
not your death, but that ye repent
and come to him. Through me he
admonishes, he invites, he warns
you." Will these men hearken to
her voice, or rather, the voice of God
through her? Does not the God they
would deny give, as it were, sensible
testimony of his existence, his power,
and his authority, evidence which
they cannot ignore or overlook save
by a wilful and deliberate effort on
their part? They cannot fail to see
the church claiming to be his. Her
unbroken existence through eighteen
centuries and her continued growth
and advance despite opposition, and,
still more, despite the quiet natural
force of all human agency, external
and internal, which under the ordinary
laws of human things would have
sufficed to disrupt and to destroy her
a hundred times, an existence and a
growth which could have proceeded
only from a supernatural power, and
which constitute a standing miracle
in the history of the world, demand
their attention and their respect.
Her claim to be divinely founded
and divinely supported, they must
not scout with flippancy. They must
at least receive it with respect, and
examine its grounds. The most solemn
assembly of that church, the
most imposing assembly the world
has looked on, an assembly authorized
by the organization which he
gave to that church, and therefore
authorized by him, speaks to them in
his name and by his authority. Will
they receive the message, or will they
turn away? Some there are who
would not believe, if one rose from
the dead. But we may hope and
pray that others will hearken to the
words of the Lord, and learn that to
know and fear the Lord is the beginning
of true wisdom. Above all, we
may hope that many who have not
yet advanced too far on the dangerous
road may become aware of their
danger and their folly, and return
to the paths of true and salutary doctrine.</p>

<p>Next to those who, following the
systems we have indicated, or on
any other grounds pretend to do
away with the existence of God, come
those who admit his existence, but do
not admit that he has given a revealed
religion to mankind. It is unnecessary
to go over the various groups
into which they may be divided.
There always have been and will be
men who will try by one huge effort
to throw off the yoke of religion.
And what is there for doing which
men will not try to assign some reason?
In the last century, and the
early portion of the present one, men
sought such reasons in the alleged
contradictions of the Scriptures, in
the mysteriousness of Christian doctrine
and the inability of the human
intellect to comprehend them, in the
procrustean systems of ancient history
which they invented, or in alleged
defects of the evidences of
Christianity, or, finally, in their pet
theories of metaphysics. At present
the tendency is to base the rejection
of revealed religion on its alleged incompatibility
with the discoveries of
natural sciences in these modern
days. Geology, anthropology, in
fact, the natural sciences with scarcely
an exception, have been in turn
laid under contribution or forced to
do service against the cause of revelation.
We have men appealing to
this or that principle or fact as an
irrefragable evidence by modern science
of the false pretensions of Christianity.</p>

<p>To all such the church, the pillar
and ground of truth, the organ of
Christ our Lord on earth, will speak.
It is not her office to enter into the
detailed discussion of scientific studies,
and to make manifest the errors
of fact into which these men have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
fallen, or the fallacy of their deductions.
This she leaves to scholars
who, in their pursuit of earthly
knowledge, do not cast away the
knowledge they have received of divine
truth. Such Christian scholars
have replied to the sneers, and gibes,
and sarcasms of the last century, and
have shown the utter worthlessness
and absurdity of the arguments then
brought forward against Christianity
by men who claimed to speak on the
part of science; and there are now
others answering with equal fulness
the more modern objections. The
church might, indeed, have left it to
time and the progress of learning and
science to vindicate her course and
to refute the objections raised against
her teaching. For, as a matter of
fact, the grand difficulties brought
forward half a century ago excite
but a smile now, as we see on what
an unsubstantial foundation they rested.
And a very few years to come
will, we may be sure, suffice to overturn
many a pet theory of to-day,
with their vaunted arguments against
revelation. New discoveries will lead
to new theories, that may or may not
give rise to a new crop, a new set of
difficulties, for man's mind is limited
and cannot reach the truth on all
sides, but they will consign the present
difficulties to the tomb of the
Capulets. To that tomb generation
after generation of these so-called
scientific objections are passing. The
church does not undertake to teach
astronomy, geology, chemistry, or
physics. Natural sciences are to be
studied by man, in the use of his own
reason and the exercise of his natural
faculties. These things God has left
to the disputations of men. The
church does not despise these discussions
and researches. She does not
repress them nor oppose them. Quite
the contrary. She has ever protected
and fostered science. One of the
most beautiful and instructive chapters
in her earthly history would be
that which tells how, from the school
of Alexandria, in the days of persecution,
down the entire course of ages,
she has ever sought to promote and
foster science. She may with pride
point to her canons and laws enacted
for this purpose in every century.
She may recount the long catalogue
of schools, colleges, and universities
established by her in every civilized
land of Europe, and wherever she
planted her foot; and to the religious
houses of her clergy, throughout the
stormy middle ages the chief, almost
the only safe homes of learning.
Many of the universities which she
founded have in the course of ages
been destroyed by kings and nobles,
who filled their own purses, or repaired
their wasted fortunes, by the
seizure of endowments given for the
free education of all that might come
to drink of these fountains of learning;
even as this very month the progressive,
liberal government of the kingdom
of Italy is discussing the propriety
of suppressing one half of the
older universities they found existing
in the portion of the Papal States, and
in other parts of Italy, which ten
years ago they annexed to the kingdom
of Sardinia. When did the
church ever do such an act? Never.
What university was ever suppressed
by any act of hers? None. She encourages
science. But at the same
time she says, "God has given to
man reason and understanding to
seek after and to attain knowledge. It
is a great and noble gift, to be prized
and used rightly, and not turned to an
evil purpose. If a father place in the
hands of his son, as a gift, a weapon
keen and bright, shall that son, with
parricidal hand turn the blade against
his father? Beware not to turn these
gifts of God against God himself.
Use them not as pretexts to deny his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
existence, or shake off his authority,
or to impugn his truth when he
speaks."</p>

<p>In giving this admonition, the
church is acting in her full right.
She is in the certain possession of that
higher divine truth which her heavenly
Founder has placed in her
charge, to be carefully guarded and
preserved until the end of time, and
to be ever faithfully preached. Who
ever denies it, she must oppose him.
Whatever teaching would make it
out to be false, she must condemn.
The church, holding with certainty
this divine deposit of the revealed
truth, must not be compared, either
in theory or in practice, with any private
individual or society of individuals,
who hold and profess religious
doctrines on the authority of their
own reason and judgment, or of their
private interpretation of the Scriptures.
In such a case as this, these
doctrines are simply beliefs, opinions
of men avowedly liable to error in this
very matter. They therefore stand
on the same level, as to certainty or
uncertainty of being true, with the
other human judgments in the fields
of natural science or human knowledge
which may rise up in opposition
to them. The two sides are
fairly matched, and either may ultimately
prevail.</p>

<p>But, on the contrary, the church
claims not merely to hold opinions,
but, under the guiding light of the
Holy Ghost, to have certain and infallible
knowledge of the truths of
divine revelation. Nothing that contradicts
these established and known
truths can she admit to be any thing
else than error. In the contest between
them, the truth must prevail.
This is the theory on which the Catholic
Church stands, and in which,
in reality, all Christianity is involved.
The experience of eighteen centuries
confirms it fully in practice. Never
once in all that period has the church
of Christ had to revoke a single doctrinal
decision, on the ground that
what was believed to be true when
uttered has since been proved to be
false as the progress of science has
thrown fuller light on the subject.
In the early days of her existence,
Celsus and the other philosophers of
that classical period raised manifold
objections from reason and such
knowledge of nature as they possessed.
Their objections accorded well
with the public opinion of the time,
and were hailed with applause. But
the time came when they were felt to be
of no force, and now they are entirely
forgotten; and the truth they impugned,
and were intended to overthrow,
stands stronger than ever.
The Gnostics, with their varied and fanciful
systems of conciliating the power
and goodness of God with the
presence of evil in the world, and guided,
if we listen to their boasts, by the
highest light of man's reason, brought
forward many objections, then deemed
specious. They and their arguments
too have passed away, and
the Catholic truth stands. So it has
been in every age until the present
time. One only instance in all history
has been alleged, seemingly, to the contrary&mdash;the
condemnation of Galileo
for holding and maintaining the Copernican
theory. But there is no real
ground of objection here. The facts
of the case are misunderstood or
misstated. The trial of Galileo, which
was in truth more of a personal than
a doctrinal issue, was simply before
the congregation, or committee, of the
Holy Office in Rome, and the sentence
was by that congregation and
not by the church. The difference
between the sentence of such a tribunal
and a decision of the church is
world-wide. And, as if to mark that
difference the more distinctly, that
sentence, which, according to the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
course, and at least as a matter of
form, should have been countersigned
by the reigning pontiff, that it might
be put into execution, <i>never was so
signed</i>. Why, in that case, the formality
was omitted, whether it was
not deemed necessary, which, considering
the usage, would be very strange,
or whether, which we think much
more probable, it was in due course
of procedure presented to the pontiff
for his signature, and he abstained from
signing it for reasons in his own mind,
cannot now be known. But the original
official manuscript copy of the sentence
is extant, and there is no signature
of the pontiff to it. Even had
he signed it, that would not have
made the document a doctrinal decision
of the church. It would have
remained simply the regular sentence
of a special tribunal; but the absence
of the pope's signature, perhaps its
studied absence, entirely and unequivocally
removes the objection usually
brought forward.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Here, as in every
other case, Christ has protected his
church, so that she shall make no false
decision as to faith. It is only in virtue
of that protection that she claims
the paramount authority to speak.
Under it she had been appointed to
speak, and must speak, if she would
not be recreant to her duty. She
does not repress science; she saves it.
She does not shackle reason; she preserves
it from error and ruin. How
often is the way of science a narrow
ridge, with deep gulfs on either side!
Feeble man walks along the narrow
crest with trembling limbs, or crawls
on, dubiously and slowly, in the dark.
The church of Christ cheers him on.
She does not bear him over the perilous
path; but holds aloft the torch of
revealed truth to guide him as he advances,
and warns him to proceed by its
light, and not to rush heedlessly on,
lest he fall into the abyss. And yet
should we not expect that the same
spirit of insubordinate pride which
leads reason to deny the existence of
God, or his Divine Providence, or
the fact of divine revelations, or emboldens
feeble, ignorant man to measure,
as it were, his feeble intelligence
against the infinite wisdom of God,
should also not refrain from charging
the Catholic Church with being an
incubus on the human mind, with
narrowing the intellect and fettering
the reason, with restricting our liberty
of thought, narrowing the field of
science, and dwarfing the whole intellectual
man?</p>

<p>But time does her justice. She can
point to Origen, Clement of Alexandria,
St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St.
Thomas of Aquin, St. Anselm, Duns
Scotus, Suarez, Vasquez, and the
mighty minds of the past. She may
point to her children, clergymen and
laymen, now standing in the front
ranks of every branch of science.
What the past ages gave, what the
present gives too, the future will as
surely not fail to give.</p>

<p>We add to the communication of
our Roman correspondent the report
of the peroration of an eloquent speech
by Signor d'Ondes-Reggio, in the
Italian Parliament, as given by M.
Chantrel, in his "Chronique du Concile,"
published in the <cite>Revue du Monde
Catholique</cite> for April 10th.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Council of the Vatican comes to
save the imperilled civilization of the world,
as the preceding councils, from the one of
Nice to that of Trent, have saved it.</p>

<p>"Do you know how the Council of Nice
saved the civilization of the world, when it
condemned Arius? It prevented the human
race from returning to idolatry; for, if
the founder of Christianity was not God, but
a mere man, the adoration of that man would
have been an idolatry like all those of the
pagans. The human race would have remained
in barbarism, deprived of Christian
civilization, of the true civilization, which is
the civilization given to men by God himself.</p>

<p>"The Council of Trent saved the civilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
of the world; because, when the church
condemned Luther, Calvin, and their followers,
who denied free-will and confounded
good with bad actions, even giving the preference
to the bad ones, she prevented the
human race from returning to the <i>fate</i> of the
pagans and to the domination of evil over
good. The church saved the civilization of
the world.</p>

<p>"When a council condemned schisms, it
condemned the breaking up of the human
race into factions and protected the unity of
the race; it condemned that paganism which
divided the nations from each other and
made them mutual enemies, whereas all men
are brothers, as the children of the same God.</p>

<p>"When a council roused all Europe to
follow the cross into Asia, to rescue the sepulchre
of Christ, it saved the civilization of
Europe, and guaranteed the civilization of
the world against Mussulman barbarism.</p>

<p>"When a council condemned the furious
iconoclasts, do you know what it did? It
prevented the banishment of the beautiful
from the world&mdash;the beautiful, which is the
complement of the true and the good. If
this new race of barbarians had not been
repelled by the Second Council of Nice, we
should not have had either the 'David,' or
the 'Moses,' or the 'Transfiguration,' or
the 'Assumption.' Italy would not be the
queen of the fine arts in the world.</p>

<p>"When the councils smote and deposed
corrupt CÃ¦sars, the oppressors of their peoples,
it was human reason, enlightened by
faith, which conquered error, sustained by
brute force; it was charity which beat down
tyranny, and civilization triumphing over
barbarism.</p>

<p>"The Council of the Vatican, composed
of the venerable fathers of the Catholic
Church, extended throughout the whole
world, differing in customs, habits, complexion,
language, but united in the same
faith, the same hope and charity&mdash;the Council
of the Vatican comes to save, by the
bishops, a civilization in peril. Errors the
most impious, the most deadly, the most
pernicious to the human race, which have
been spread abroad during the course of
ages, and which have sufficed, taken singly,
to turn civil society upside down, are now
all assembled together, and united with
each other to batter and destroy it. Every
thing which is the most true, the most sacred,
the most venerated, is attacked; and
some persons even go so far as to say that
it is lawful to kill, to rob, and to calumniate,
in order to attain certain ends. The Council
of the Vatican has come, yes, it has come!
to condemn these blasphemies and iniquities,
to awaken sleeping consciences, to confirm
consciences which are wavering; it has come
to save civilization in peril.</p>

<p>"O venerable fathers! you who have
hastened to Rome from the extremities of the
world, at the summons of the successor of
Peter, and who are at this moment gathered
together in the name of God, at the Vatican,
all men of good-will have their eyes fixed
upon you; and from you they await with
confidence the salvation of the world. You,
successors of the apostles, will fulfil the
commandment given by Jesus Christ to the
apostles and to you, to teach the nations the
infallible truths; the commandment given,
not to kings, emperors, or secular assemblies,
but to the apostles and to you&mdash;you
will teach the nations these infallible truths,
and the nations will be saved."</p></blockquote>

<h2>FOREIGN LITERARY NOTES.</h2>


<p><cite>The Gospel in the Law.</cite> A Critical
Examination of the Citations from the
Old Testament in the New. By Charles
Taylor. Cambridge and London: Bell
&amp; Daldy. 1869. The relative positions
of the Mosaic law and the new law may
be studied from a great many points of
view. That chosen by Mr. Taylor, in
the volume before us, adds additional
interest to his very remarkable work.</p>

<p>The selection and study of citations
from the Old Testament found in the
New give rise to many questions which,
properly elucidated, throw much light
on the connection which exists between
Judaism and Christianity. Mr. Taylor
does not so much occupy himself with
that question as with the manner in
which the Bible is connected with the
Testament. Not that he undertakes to
demonstrate that the germ of the new
law may be found in the Old; for that
no one denies, and the title he has selected
shows the object of his work,
"the Gospel in the law." Not every
thing in the work is new; but the previously
accumulated erudition of the subject
is admirably <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rÃ©sumÃ©d</i>, and several
chapters are marked by originality&mdash;the
thirteenth, for instance, on Jewish
and Christian morality.</p>

<p><cite>Varieties of Irish History.</cite> From Ancient
and Modern Sources and Original
Documents. By James J. Gaskin, Dublin.
A handsome volume, illustrated with
four chromo-lithographs, and an excellent
map of the environs of Dublin. The
work appears to be made up of a series
of lectures delivered at Dalkey, a well-known
charming suburb of Dublin, and
of articles published at various times in
the Irish newspapers concerning the history
of the principal environs of Dublin&mdash;Howth,
Kingston, Dalkey, Bray, and
Killing. The beautiful bay of Dublin
and its picturesque shores, of course,
come in for their share of notice, and as
the author gives himself the amplest
verge, he manages, in his numberless
digressions, to throw into his pages a
reflex of the intellectual history of Dublin
during the last century.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of the most remarkable and eventful
missionary fields of the Catholic
Church was, unquestionably, Japan.
There are few more admirable pages in
its history than those which recount
the constancy and faith of its first martyrs
under one of the most bloody persecutions
the world ever saw. M. LÃ©on
Pages has just published a work giving
the history of Catholicity in Japan from
1598 to 1651: <cite>Histoire de la Religion
ChrÃ©tienne au Japon, depuis 1598 jusqu'Ã 
1651, comprenant les faits relatifs
aux deux cent cinq martyrs beatifiÃ©s le
7 Juillet 1867</cite>, par LÃ©on Pages. This
volume, published separately, will form
the third volume of a large work in four
octavo volumes, to be entitled, <cite>L'Empire

chrÃ©tienne, ses relations avec l'Europe</cite>.</p>

<p>The so-called <i>Truce of God</i> of the
middle ages, under which a suspension
of arms and hostilities was so often obtained,
has too frequently been so imperfectly
understood and treated by historians
and writers as to be confounded
by them with the <i>Peace of God</i>&mdash;two
things essentially different in origin and
in application. In 1857, a work on the
subject was published at Paris by M.
Ernest Semichon, who by his judicious
research threw an entirely new light on
this question. M. Semichon has just
presented the literary world with a new
edition of the work of 1857, largely augmented
in fresh matter and in historical
documents, in which he clearly establishes
the distinction between these two
institutions, and fixes the origin of the
Peace of God at about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 988, and
that of the Truce of God at 1027. He
follows their development step by step
through the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth
centuries, examining them from
the judicial and political stand-points,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
until the period when Louis le Gros
took hold of the movement. After this
period, the "Truce of God" becomes
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quarantaine le Roi</i>. In treating
his subject, M. Semichon presents
most interesting views of the great institutions
of the middle ages, its associations
and customs, and also of the
chevaliers, the arts, and the Crusades.
His work is entitled <cite>La Paix et la
TrÃ¨ve de Dieu</cite>.</p>

<p>Until within a few years there were
known to be in existence but three
Biblical manuscripts of high antiquity.
These were, <i>First</i>, the celebrated Vatican
manuscript; <i>second</i>, that of London,
called the Alexandrine; <i>third</i>, that of
Paris, known under the designation of
the Palimpsest of Ephrem the Syrian.
The first dates from the fourth century,
the other two from the fifth. None of
them are complete, however. In that
of Paris the greater part of the New
Testament is wanting. That of London
is deficient in nearly the whole of
the first gospel, two chapters of the
fourth, and the greater part of the second
Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians.
From the Vatican manuscript,
the oldest of all, are missing four epistles,
the last chapters of the Epistle to
the Hebrews, and the Apocalypse. M.
Constantine Tischendorf, a distinguished
Russian scholar, known in the scientific
world for his superior Hellenic
and paleographic acquirements, has
the glory of having given to the Christian
world, by his discoveries, numerous
sacred manuscripts of the highest
antiquity, and, above all, the famous
<cite>Codex Sinaiticus</cite>, which has over the
three <span class="smcap lowercase">MSS.</span> we have enumerated the
great advantage of being complete. It
dates from the same epoch with that of
the Vatican. M. Tischendorf has told
the story of its discovery, and of the
long and difficult negotiations required
for its acquisition, in a work just published,
<cite>Terre Sainte</cite>, an octavo volume
of 307 pages. The volume also
contains an interesting account of his
oriental travel in company with the
Duke Constantine, and his visit to
Smyrna, Patmos, and Constantinople.
A fac-simile edition of the new Codex
is in preparation in Russia, and a German
translation of that portion of it
which contains the New Testament
will shortly be made.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A noteworthy work is <cite>Le Juif, le
Judaisme, et Judaisation des peuples
chrÃ©tiens</cite>, par M. le Chevalier Gougeuot
des Mousseaux. Paris, 8vo, 568 pp.
The career of Judaism is here historically
traced from the early ages of the
church, when it spread through Egypt,
Alexandria, and Rome the Gnostic theories
of Simon the Magician, down to
the present day. The author presents
successively all the traditions upon
which the belief of the modern Jew is
founded. Their Bible is the Talmud,
a tissue of absurdities and immoralities.
There exists a gulf between the
ancient law of Moses and the Talmudic
reveries so great, indeed, that the Jew
can hardly call his law a religious law
without flying in the face of the history
and the faith of his fathers. Following
these researches comes a keen analysis
of the Pharisaical spirit. Concerning
the synagogue, the Sanhedrim, the Talmudic
rites, and system of education,
the work gives the fullest details, with
copious extracts from writers all favorable
to Judaism, such as Prideaux, Basnage,
and Salvador. The result of the
author's revelations is to show that the
Jewish belief of to-day is absolutely
different from that of which Moses was
the legislator. Modern Jews are divided
into three classes&mdash;orthodox, reformers,
and free-thinkers. The reformers
are the Protestants of the
Mosaic law. Nowadays, for the majority
of Jews, the coming of the Messiah
is no longer understood in its
ordinary acceptation. For them the
"desired of nations" is merely an abstraction.
The author dwells at some
length on the spreading influence of
Judaism in worldly matters, and sounds
a note of alarm that gives his work
something of a pessimist tone.</p>

<h2>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>


<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Dr. Newman's Essay in Aid of a
Grammar of Assent.</span> By John
Henry Newman, D.D., of the Oratory.
1 vol. 12mo. New York: The Catholic
Publication Society, 9 Warren
street. 1870.</p>

<p class="center">SECOND NOTICE.</p>

<p>We have not yet given to this book,
destined to become so celebrated and
the theme of so much controversy, the
careful examination it deserves, and we
will not, therefore, pay the poor compliment
to the illustrious author of pronouncing
a superficial judgment upon it.
We have given an analysis of its contents
in our last number, which may aid
the reader to understand and master its
scope and course of argument for himself.
At present, we will merely take
note of one or two salient points bearing
on some questions of lively controversial
interest at the present moment.
The great subject of controversy in regard
to the philosophy of the work has
already proved to be what we anticipated
at the first glance upon its pages&mdash;whether
it is, or is not, in contradiction
to the scholastic doctrine of the reality
of universals. We give merely our impression,
and not our judgment upon
this point, when we say that it appears
to us that Dr. Newman rather leaves
aside the pure metaphysics of the question,
than either contradicts or affirms
any scholastic doctrine of this higher
sphere of science. He appears to take
the common English axioms of reasoning
as they are assumed in every-day
life and made the basis of those inductions
and illations which make up the
opinions of intelligent persons on all
sorts of subjects, and the conclusions of
practical, scientific men in regard to the
inductive sciences. He appeals to the
common sense of those who are not sophisticated
by any false, sceptical maxims
in relation to common things, but
who are simply puzzled by an apparent
want of the same certitude in religion
which they hold as unquestioned in
lower branches of knowledge. He undertakes
to show that the principles of
assent which all men act on in the
affairs of this life lead logically to the
same certitude of the infallibility of the
Catholic Church, and the truth of every
thing she proposes to belief, that a man
has that Great Britain is an island. If
any one thinks there is a break or a
weak spot in his chain of reasoning, let
him pull it apart and throw the fragments
aside, and he will have accomplished
a considerable feat in logic. We think
that, on account of this manner of approaching
the subject, this book is likely
to prove extremely useful in convincing
sincere, well-intentioned doubters,
whose minds have been educated under
the same circumstances and in the same
intellectual atmosphere with those of
the author. As for the analysis of certitude
itself, and the metaphysics of the
ultimate question how we know, and
what is that which we know first, the
author may be criticised; but we think,
as we have said, that he did not have it
in view to propose a theory. We do
perceive and know; we do exist, and we
know that other things exist, and we are
certain of these things, and no pretended
sceptic really doubts. We may start
from this, therefore, as a fixed base of
operation, without waiting for a metaphysical
theory. If the theory which
we hold is incorrect, we can change it
without hurting our argument, just as a
person who lives in a regular and sensible
manner, and is in good health, can
change a physiological doctrine which
he finds to be erroneous without changing
his practical rules of living. Whether
Dr. Newman's statement respecting
real and notional assents be correct or
not, every candid and honest man will
acknowledge that he does assent with
certitude to the truth of those things
which the author calls notions. We
suspect, moreover, that the illustrious
author in his affirmation that nothing
really exists except individuals, means
that there are no other spiritual or material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
<i>substances</i>; or, in other words, that
every substance is a simple monad existing
in itself and separate from every
other. We do not apprehend that, in
denying that time, space, relation, etc.,
are real, he intends to affirm that they
are mere subjective affections of our
minds without any foundation in objective
reality, but only that they are not
either spirits or bodies, and would be
nothing if there were no spirit or body
in existence. We suspect that the nominalism
attributed to Dr. Newman is
merely in the phrase, and that his difference
from the realism of St. Thomas
is only in the terminology.</p>

<p>The other point we desire to notice is
theological. Our Episcopalian neighbors,
and some others also, are accustomed to
refer to Dr. Newman as an instance in
proof of their frequent assertion that
men of genius and learning in our communion
chafe under the yoke of Rome,
and, if they are converts, feel themselves
disappointed in the expectations with
which they entered the church. The
recent letter of Dr. Newman to Dr.
Ullathorne is, of course, a lucky windfall
for them, and is interpreted as a
proof that they were not mistaken. The
volume we are noticing will, for every
candid and sensible reader, completely
scatter to the winds any false and calumnious
attempts to class Dr. Newman
with Mr. Ffoulkes, Mr. Renouf,
the translator of <i>Janus</i>, and the rest of
that clique in England, or to impeach
the integrity of his faith and loyalty as
a Catholic priest and theologian. The
letter itself shows that Dr. Newman
holds what his writings show he has always
held, as the more probable doctrine,
that the judgments of the pope in
matters of faith are infallible. The utmost
extent of his expressions of repugnance
to a definition of this doctrine is,
that he considers the weakness of faith,
the lack of knowledge, and the deficiency
of the reasoning faculty in a number
of Catholics to be so great, and
the bewilderment of mind so extreme
in persons outside the church who are
seeking the truth, that they cannot bear
to have the light too suddenly and
brightly flashed into their eyes. The
great and holy Oratorian father pities
these souls, and wishes to have them
cautiously and gently led into the truth;
and he is afraid that the pope, sitting in
the effulgence of the divine Shekinah in
the temple of God, does not appreciate
the state of those who are living in the
fainter light or the clouded climates of
a remoter region. The chapter of the
volume under notice entitled, "Belief in
Dogmatic Theology," will show beyond
a question what we have asserted of
Dr. Newman's theological soundness,
and we quote one passage as a specimen.</p>

<p>The church "makes it imperative
on every one, priest and layman, to
profess as revealed truth all the canons
of councils, <i>and innumerable decisions
of popes</i>, propositions so various, so notional,
that but few can know them, and
fewer can understand them." (P. 142,
Eng. ed.)</p>

<p>In the chapter on the "Indefectibility
of Certitude" occurs this passage: "A
man is converted to the Catholic Church
from his admiration of its religious system,
and his disgust with Protestantism.
That admiration remains; but, after a
time, he leaves his new faith; perhaps
returns to his old. The reason, if we
may conjecture, may sometimes be this:
he has never believed in the church's
infallibility; in her doctrinal truth he
has believed, but in her infallibility, no.
He was asked, before he was received,
whether he held all that the church
taught; he replied he did; but he understood
the question to mean, whether he
held those particular doctrines 'which
at that time the church in matter of fact
formally taught,' whereas it really meant
'whatever the church then or at any
future time should teach.' Thus, he
never had the indispensable and elementary
faith of a Catholic, and was
simply no subject for reception into the
fold of the church. This being the case,
when the immaculate conception is defined,
he feels that it is something more
than he bargained for when he became
a Catholic, and accordingly he gives up
his religious profession. The world
will say that he has lost his certitude of
the divinity of the Catholic faith; but he
never had it." (P. 240.)</p>

<p>We do not desire to have a party tolerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
in the church whose principles
are precisely those here condemned by
Dr. Newman, or to have the way open
for converts to be received who lack the
"indispensable and elementary faith of
a Catholic." We look with dismay upon
the audacious and heretical attitude
of that fallen angel F. Hyacinthe, the
scandalous position assumed by Huber,
DÃ¶llinger, and Gratry, and we anticipate
greater impediment to the progress
of the faith from a miserable counterfeit
and pseudo-catholicity, which is nothing
else than the base metal coined by Photius,
than from the difficulties hanging
about the history of the popes, which are
no greater than those that beset councils,
tradition, or the holy Scripture itself.
Whatever definitions are promulgated
by the Council of the Vatican, no
one pretending to be a Catholic can hesitate
to receive them because they are
"more than he bargained for." Those
who have chafed under the doctrinal
authority of the popes have been crying
out for a council for two centuries.
Those who are <i>bona fide</i> in any doubt
or uncertainty respecting questions not
yet defined have the way open for their
doubts to be settled. If there are persons
in the communion of the church
who have not the principle of faith in
them by which they are prepared without
hesitation to believe whatever the
Council of the Vatican proposes, we
desire that they should leave their external
connection with the Catholic
Church, which they have already inwardly
abandoned. And we think it
most necessary that the duty of unreserved
submission to the infallible authority
of the church, and to the Roman
pontiff, as her supreme teacher and
judge as well as ruler, should be most
distinctly placed before those who seek
admission into her fold. We are grateful
to Dr. Newman for the clear and unmistakable
tones in which he has spoken
on the obligation of believing whatever
the church commands us to believe
through the mouth of the sovereign
pontiff; and as for the question what definitions
are necessary and opportune
for the present time, we confide absolutely
in the divinely assisted judgment
of Pius IX. and the Catholic episcopate.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, we are glad
to see that Dr. Newman has written another
letter, in which the following passage
occurs: "I have not had a moment's
wavering of trust in the Catholic
Church ever since I was received into
her fold. I hold, and ever have held,
that her sovereign pontiff is the centre
of unity and the vicar of Christ. And I
ever have had, and have still, an unclouded
faith in her creed in all its articles;
a supreme satisfaction in her
worship, discipline, and teaching; and an
eager longing, and a hope against hope,
that the many dear friends whom I have
left in Protestantism may be partakers
in my happiness." (<cite>Tablet</cite>, April 16th.)
We are glad, we say, to see this, not on
our own account, for we have the honor
of a personal acquaintance with the illustrious
Oratorian, and know him too
well to have the need of any such assurance
of his firm and ardent Catholic
faith and piety; but in order that the
mouths of cavillers may be stopped, and
those weak brethren who tremble like
aspen-leaves in every light breeze be
reassured.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Origin, Persecutions, and Doctrines
of the Waldenses; from
Documents, many now for the
first time collected and edited.</span>
By Pius Melia, D.D. London:
James Toovey, 177 Piccadilly. 1870.
For sale by the Catholic Publication
Society, 9 Warren street, New York.</p>

<p>In the year 1868, a London daily
newspaper produced editorially one of
those statements so frequently made
concerning the Waldenses, and which,
by dint of repetition, end by passing for
recognized facts. It was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For sixteen hundred years, at least, the
Waldenses have guarded the pure and primitive
Christianity of the apostles.... No
one knows when or how the faith was first
delivered to these mountaineers. IrenÃ¦us,
Bishop of Lyons, in the second century found
them a church.</p>

<p>"These gallant hill-men have kept the
tradition of the Gospel committed to them as
pure and inviolate as the snow upon their
own Alps. They have maintained an evangelical
form of Christianity from the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
first, rejecting image-worship, invocation of
saints, auricular confession, celibacy, papal
supremacy or infallibility, and the dogma of
purgatory; taking the Scripture as the rule
of life, and admitting no sacraments but
baptism and the Lord's Supper.... No
bloodier cruelty disgraces the records of the
papacy than the persecutions endured by the
ancestors of the twenty thousand Waldenses
now surviving.... Never did men suffer
more for their belief."</p></blockquote>

<p>As the author mildly presents it, these
statements not being in accordance with
his knowledge of the subject, he was
moved to undertake a thorough investigation
of the history of the Waldenses.
To this end, in addition to the perusal
of a long and formidable list of works
given in the preface, and which is valuable
as presenting the bibliography of
the subject, he made thorough investigation
in the great libraries of England,
Rome, and Turin, which last collection
was found very rich in <span class="smcap lowercase">MSS.</span> referring
to the Waldensian period. Fresh stimulus
and efficient aid were given to
his efforts by the appearance of a very
important work by Professor James
Henthorn Todd, Senior Fellow of Trinity
Church, Dublin, entitled, <cite>The Book
of the Vaudois; The Waldensian Manuscripts</cite>,
which gives a notice of
the long-lost Morland manuscripts lately
discovered by Mr. Henry Bradshaw,
M.A., Fellow of King's College, Cambridge,
and librarian of that university.
These <span class="smcap lowercase">MSS.</span> are undoubtedly "the oldest
extant relics of the Vaudois literature,"
and the most important documents relating
to their history.</p>

<p>The author forcibly presents <i>in extenso</i>,
and in separate chapters, the testimony
of Richard, Monk of Cluny, Moneta,
De Bellavilla, Abbot Bernard, Reinerius
Sacco, Archbishop Seyssell, Eneas
Sylvius Piccolomini, Casini, and many
others, and in the fifteenth section addresses
himself to prove that the dates
which Leger and Morland have assigned
to the Waldensian <span class="smcap lowercase">MSS.</span> are counterfeit.
Leger assigns <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1100 as the
date of the <cite>Nobla LeyÃ§on</cite> and the <cite>Catechism</cite>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">MSS.</span> Our author shows
that these writings are of the fifteenth,
not the twelfth century, and that the date
assigned by Leger involves the contradiction
of proving that the Waldenses
existed as a sect before the period of its
founder, Peter Waldo.</p>

<p>One long chapter is devoted to the
supposed cruel Waldensian massacre of
the year 1655, as related in the often-quoted
<cite>Histoire VÃ©ritable des Vaudois</cite>,
and to the particular murders described
by Leger. These are confronted with
the legal testimony touching the same
facts.</p>

<p>The work closes with an exposition
of the Waldensian theological tenets,
each one being presented separately
with a statement of the Catholic doctrine
on that tenet upon the same page.</p>

<p>The book is a beautiful specimen of
typography, and is illustrated with several
photographs of pages of the Morland
manuscripts.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Charlestown Convent; Its
Destruction by a Mob, etc.</span>
Compiled from authentic sources.
Boston: P. Donahoe. 1870.</p>

<p>We remember distinctly the Ursuline
Convent at Charlestown, as it appeared
forty years ago, crowning a gentle
summit with its grave and dignified
buildings, and attractive grounds laid
out and cultivated with taste; a retreat
of piety and a school of religious and
solid education. We have often enough
since that time looked upon its ruins, a
perpetual monument of disgrace to Boston
and Massachusetts, a token of shame
in close proximity to that other monument,
a monument of imperishable glory,
which crowns the site of the battle of
Bunker Hill. This pamphlet describing
the atrocious and barbarian outrage
perpetrated on the night of August 11th,
1834, with the train of preceding and
succeeding events connected with it,
presents a page in our history which
many persons would do well to ponder
attentively. The outrage was occasioned
by the publication of <cite>Six Months in a
Convent</cite>, one of a class of vile publications
which, for a time, were widely circulated
and swallowed with credulity,
but afterward universally scouted with
that scorn and loathing which the American
people always feels when it discovers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
that it has been duped by the
wicked and designing. There would
be no need of reviving the memory of
these things, if the same style of attack
upon Catholics had not been renewed
at intervals, and were not adopted at the
present moment by restless fanatics,
who, knowing that they are incapable of
coping with us in fair argument, are
fain to resort to these criminal methods
of appealing to prejudice, bigotry, ignorance,
and passion, hoping to stir up the
populace to a crusade against the Catholic
religion. The abettors of Rebecca
Reed and Maria Monk in the
pulpit and the press have had successors
to the present time. The Massachusetts
Legislature has had its "smelling
committee;" Missouri has passed
its outrageous laws; other legislatures
have attempted to lay their hands upon
the property of the Catholic Church;
the most infamous laws are even now
in consideration before the Legislature
of Pennsylvania; we have had the archangel
Gabriel, and Judson, and Gavazzi,
and Leahy, and we have now Bishop
Coxe, Bellows, Hepworth, and Muller.
The same firm of publishers which formerly
was so active and conspicuous in
putting forth the most vulgar and violent
attacks upon the Catholic religion,
although in one instance it found it expedient
to hide itself under an <i>alias</i>,
continues its work under the guise of a
more pretentious literature, embellished
by offensive caricatures of the most
venerable and sacred objects of the religious
veneration of Catholics. The
spirit of falsification, the intention to stir
up popular passion, the intolerance disguised
under the name of liberalism, the
determination to treat the Catholic clergy
as the heads of a faction with ulterior
treasonable and revolutionary designs,
and the Catholic religion as a nuisance
which ought to be extirpated by violence,
are the same in the modern agitators
that they were in their predecessors, and
are in their English compeers, the Newdegates
and Whalleys of the British Parliament.
They tend to similar results
with those which similar agitators have
heretofore produced. The same train
is laid, the same spark applied, and the
chance of a similar explosion depends
on the fact of the existence or non-existence
of a similar magazine of slumbering
popular prejudice and inflammable
passion. We say, therefore, that it is
well for considerate persons who desire
the peace of the community to read and
reflect upon this pamphlet. It is necessary
that some very important questions
should arise, where Catholics and non-Catholics
form important elements in
the same political community, with equal
rights. It is impossible that peace and
good order should be preserved, unless
these matters can be discussed and
arranged calmly and amicably. Therefore
we say that the agitators who appeal
to a violent solution, in case Catholics
are not content with a simple toleration
under a Protestant domination,
are enemies of the public peace, and
ought to be regarded as such by all good
citizens. The Catholic clergy will never
be agitators. If the effort is made by
demagogues to pervert the Catholic or
Irish sentiment into an impetus of illegal,
revolutionary movements, like the
riot of 1863 and the Fenian plot against
Canada, the whole authority of the
church and all the influence of the clergy
will be put forth against it. It is for the
present and future advantage and interest
of this country that the influence of
the Catholic clergy over their people
should be as great as possible, and that
of clerical agitators and demagogues reduced
to nothing.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Life of St. Charles Borromeo.</span>
Edited by Edward Healy Thompson,
A.M. Philadelphia: Peter F. Cunningham.
1870.</p>

<p>St. Charles Borromeo was one of the
greatest of the true reformers of the sixteenth
century. During the lifetime of
his Uncle, Pius IV., he held many of the
highest offices in the Roman court, possessed
the pope's entire confidence,
and exerted a powerful influence in favor
of whatever was for the good of the
church. To his exertions were due, in
no small degree, the reassembling of the
Council of Trent, and the successful
completion of its labors eighteen years
after its opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>At the death of Pius IV., St. Charles
returned to his diocese, and straightway
entered upon the work of its reformation,
in accordance with the decrees
of Trent. He succeeded in effecting a
complete reform, and the example which
he thus gave had a most salutary effect.</p>

<p>The <cite>Life</cite> before us is well written;
it gives not only the facts, but likewise
in some degree the philosophy of history;
and it is free from that religious
mannerism, so to speak, which is not
unfrequently met with in books of this
class. The typography and binding are
in keeping with the contents. There
are, however, a great many very serious
errors of the press defacing this otherwise

<p>This elementary treatise upon botany

The book is intended to cultivate the

In ordinary text-books, the beginner is
expected to master a great number of
definitions and distinctions before he
ventures to go into the fields and study
for himself. We have always considered
this method irksome, and we know it to
be fruitless of result. We therefore very
heartily welcome Miss Youmans's little
work. We hope that she has inaugurated
a reform in the teaching of the natural
sciences. We confidently recommend
the book to all Catholic schools

form a portion of the course of
studies.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Monks before Christ</span>; Their

&amp; Co. 1870.</p>

<p>This is one of the most shallow and
stupid productions we have met with in
a long time. The author met with some
rather poor specimens of the monastic
order in Europe, and breaks out into the
exclamation, "Great heavens! and these
are the men who had the exclusive manipulation
of our Scriptures for several
hundred years!" (Page 18.) One who
is so extremely weak in the reasoning
faculty as this passage indicates has
no business to write a book on serious
topics, and is unworthy of refutation.
The author informs us that
monasticism is based on the ManichÃ¦an
doctrine of an evil principle in
matter. This shows an <em>inconceivable</em>
ignorance which we cannot think is
<em>invincible</em> or excusable, since the author
resided several months at the University
of Munich, and was well acquainted
with the learned Benedictines
of that capital, over whom the celebrated
Haneberg is abbot.</p>

By Mrs. Anna H. Dorsay.
New York: P. O'Shea. 1870.</p>

<p>The author of this volume has given
us a pleasant story, interesting both to
Catholics and Protestants, as tales of
conversions to the true faith cannot fail
to be when founded, as this appears to
be, on fact. The pictures of natural
scenery are fresh and life-like, and the
moral and religious teaching unexceptionable.
It is carelessly written, which
will prevent the book from taking rank
as a first-class story, though it will interest
and profit certain minds, who
would not prize it more highly if it
were thoroughly cultivated and refined.</p>

<p>A moment's thought would have prevented
mistakes in local customs, such
as introducing a hay-tedder into farming
operations forty years ago, and making
our Puritan forefathers <i>go up</i> to their
communion, whereas they had not reverence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
enough for the <i>symbols</i> to rise
or kneel at their reception, but remained
seated in their pews, even as their descendants
do to this day.</p>

<p>The blunders in spelling which mar
many pages of the book would disgrace
a third-rate proof-reader, and we are certain
the author never saw the proofs.
Both paper and type are of inferior quality.
These faults are the more inexcusable,
as the beautiful covering, with
the choice gilded medallion and precious
motto, led us to look for something very
nice in the way of print and paper.</p>

Such expressions as "the worship

the "policy of the popes always was to
foster disunion in Italy, in order to profit

it unfit for introduction among Catholics.
It is to be regretted that a book like this,

statements which are not historically

that there is a call for the purity and
high-toned sentiment that flow from the

<p>Twenty years ago, her works afforded
interest and instruction, the present volume
to mothers especially, and though
her children and grown people are sometimes
stiff and priggish, and are wont to
talk like books, they are always well-bred

<p>It was formerly a criticism on her

brought against <i>Home Influence</i> with
any truth.</p>

Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
God and the Redeemer of mankind,
when about to return to his heavenly
Father, promised that he would be
with his church, militant on earth, all
days even to the consummation of the
world. Wherefore, he has never at
any time failed to be with his beloved
spouse, to assist her in her teaching,
to bless her in her labors, to aid her
in danger. And this his saving
providence, unceasingly displayed in
countless other blessings, is most clearly
made manifest by those very abundant
fruits which have come to the
Christian world from &oelig;cumenical
councils, and especially from that of
Trent, although it was held in evil
days. For thereby the holy doctrines
of religion were more distinctly defined
and more fully set forth; errors
were condemned and restrained; thereby
ecclesiastical discipline was restored
and more firmly established; zeal
for learning and piety was promoted
among the clergy; and colleges were
provided for the training of young
men for the sacred ministry; and
finally the practice of Christian morality
was restored among the people by
more careful instruction and a more
frequent use of the sacraments. Hence
arose, likewise, a closer union of the
members with the visible head, and
renewed strength to the entire mystical
body of Christ; hence the increased
number of religious communities,
and of other institutions of Christian
piety; hence, also, that unceasing zeal,
constant even to martyrdom, to spread
the kingdom of Christ throughout the
world.

The same holy Mother Church

reason; "for the invisible things of
him, from the creation of the world,
are clearly seen, being understood by
the things that are made," (Romans
i. 20;) but that nevertheless it has
pleased his wisdom and goodness to
reveal to mankind, by another and
that a supernatural way, himself and
the eternal decrees of his will; even
as the apostle says, "God who at
sundry times and in divers manners
spoke, in times past, to the fathers by
the prophets, last of all, in these days
hath spoken to us by his Son."
(Heb. i. 1, 2.) To this divine revelation
is it to be ascribed that things
regarding God, which are not of themselves
beyond the grasp of human reason,
may, even in the present condition
of the human race, be known by all,
readily, with full certainty and without
any admixture of error. Yet not
on this account is revelation absolutely
necessary, but because God, of his
infinite goodness, has ordained man
for a supernatural end, for the participation,
that is, of divine goods, which
altogether surpass the understanding
of the human mind; for "eye hath
not seen nor ear heard, neither hath it
entered into the heart of man, what
things God hath prepared for them
that love him." (1 Cor. ii. 9.)

believing it. (2 Council of Orange,
Can. 7.) Wherefore faith in itself, even
though it be not working by charity,
is a gift of God; and an act of faith
is a work tending to salvation, whereby
man renders free obedience to God
himself, consenting to and coÃ¶perating
with his grace, which he hath
power to resist.

For only to the Catholic Church do

Whence it is that she, as a standard
set up unto the nations, (Is. xi. 12,)
at the same time calls to herself those
who have not yet believed, and shows
to her children that the faith which
they hold rests on a most solid foundation.
And to this, her testimony,
effectual aid is supplied by power
from above. For the Lord, infinitely
merciful, on the one hand stirs up by
his grace and helps those who are in
error, that they may be able to come
to the knowledge of the truth; and,
on the other hand, those whom he
hath transferred from darkness into
his marvellous light he confirms by
his grace, that they may persevere in
that same light, never abandoning
them unless he be first by them abandoned.
Wherefore, totally unlike is
the condition of those who, by the
heavenly gift of faith, have embraced
the catholic truth, and of those who,
led by human opinions, are following
a false religion; for they who have
received the faith under the teaching
of the church can never have a just
reason to change that faith or call it
into doubt. Wherefore, giving thanks
to God the Father, who hath made
us worthy to be partakers of the lot
of the saints in light, let us not neglect
so great salvation, but looking
on Jesus, the author and finisher of
our faith, let us hold fast the confession
of our hope without wavering.

Moreover, the Catholic Church has
ever held, as she now holds, that there
exists a two-fold order of knowledge,
each of which is distinct from the
other both as to its principle and as
to its object. As to its principle, because
in the one we know by natural
reason, in the other by divine faith;
as to the object, because, besides
those things to which natural reason
can attain, there are proposed to our
belief mysteries hidden in God which,
unless by him revealed, cannot come
to our knowledge. Wherefore the
same apostle, who beareth witness
that God was known to the Gentiles
by the things that are made, yet when
speaking of the grace and truth that
came by Jesus Christ, (John i. 17.)
says, "We speak the wisdom of God
in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden;
which God ordained before the
world unto our glory; which none of
the princes of this world knew; but
which God hath revealed to us by his
Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all
things, yea the deep things of God."
(1 Cor. ii. 7, 8, 10.) And the only-begotten
Son thanks the Father that
he has hid these things from the wise
and prudent, and has revealed them
to little ones. (Matt. xi. 25.)

Reason, indeed, enlightened by
faith and seeking with diligence and
godly sobriety, may, by God's gift,
come to some understanding, limited
in degree, but most wholesome in its
effects, of mysteries, both from the
analogy of things which are naturally
known, and from the connection of
the mysteries themselves with one
another and with man's last end.
But never can reason be rendered
capable of thoroughly understanding
mysteries, as it does those truths
which form its proper object. For
God's mysteries, of their very nature,
so far surpass the reach of created
intellect, that even when taught by
revelation, and received by faith, they
remain covered by faith itself as by a
veil, and shrouded as it were in darkness
as long as in this mortal life
"we are absent from the Lord; for
we walk by faith, and not by sight."

<td class="tdl">
But although faith be above reason,
there never can be a real disagreement
between them, since the
same God who reveals mysteries and
infuses faith has given to man's soul
the light of reason; and God cannot
deny himself nor can one truth ever
contradict another. Wherefore the
empty shadow of such contradiction
arises chiefly from this, that either
the doctrines of faith are not understood
and set forth as the church
really holds them, or that the vain
devices and opinions of men are mistaken
for the dictates of reason. We
therefore definitively pronounce false
every assertion which is contrary
to the enlightened truth of faith.
(V. Lateran Counc. Bull <cite>Apostolici
Regiminis</cite>.) Moreover the church,
which, together with her apostolic
office of teaching, is charged also
with the guardianship of the deposit
of faith, holds likewise from God
the right and the duty to condemn
"knowledge falsely so called," (1
Tim. vi. 20,) "lest any man be cheated
by philosophy and vain deceit."
(Col. ii. 8.) Hence all the Christian
faithful are not only forbidden to
defend as legitimate conclusions of
science those opinions which are
known to be contrary to the doctrine
of faith, especially when condemned
by the church, but are rather
absolutely bound to hold them
for errors wearing a deceitful appearance
of truth.

Not only is it impossible for faith
and reason ever to contradict each
other, but they rather afford each
other mutual assistance. For right
reason establishes the foundations of
faith and by the aid of its light cultivates
the science of divine things;
and faith, on the other hand, frees
and preserves reason from errors, and
enriches it with knowledge of many
kinds. So far, then, is the church
from opposing the culture of human
arts and sciences, that she rather
aids and promotes it in many ways.
For she is not ignorant of, nor does
she despise the advantages which
flow from them to the life of men;
on the contrary, she acknowledges
that, as they sprang from God the
Lord of knowledge, so, if they be
rightly pursued, they will, through
the aid of his grace, lead to God.
Nor does she forbid any of those sciences
the use of its own principles
and its own method within its own
proper sphere; but recognizing this
reasonable freedom, she only takes
care that they may not by contradicting
God's teaching, fall into errors,
or, overstepping their due limits,
invade and throw into confusion the
domain of faith.

by God has not been proposed, like
some philosophical discovery, to be
made perfect by human ingenuity;
but it has been delivered to the

Therefore as generations and
centuries roll on, let the understanding,

<p class="p2 center spaced break-before"><big>THE
CATHOLIC WORLD.</big><br />

VOL. XI., No. 64.&mdash;JULY, 1870.</p>

<h2>THE CATHOLIC OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</h2>


<p>The Catholic, like the church, is
one and the same in all ages and all
times. As she came forth from the
hands of her Architect finished, complete,
and perfect in every particular
of solid structure and exquisite adornment,
in like manner the individual
member, if he be faithful to her tradition,
practice, and direction, is, with
the allowance of human infirmity, perfect
and complete in one age as well
as another, without regard to local
circumstances of civil government,
education, exterior refinement, occupation,
complexion, or race.</p>

<p>Religion in its interior nature and
intention has reference to the life to
come. The life to come is the complement
of the present; as the religion
of the Catholic Church is perfect, the
future life which grows from the seeds
planted in time must necessarily be
absolute perfection and unending satisfaction.
The temporal fruit must
likewise become true material well-being,
if its growth and perfection be
not interrupted by adventitious causes.</p>

<p>The assertion of the absolute perfection
of the Catholic religion, with
reference to time as well as eternity,
is made with precisely the same significance
with which we assert the
perfection of God. It is made simply
and boldly, without hesitation, qualification,
or reserve, and it will be the
basis of our argument, and the starting-place
for the views and opinions
we propose to put forth. It is intended
for Catholic eyes. The defence
of the proposition is no part of our
concern.</p>

<p>When they who deny or dispute it
shall have vanquished a single one of
the great champions of our faith from
Athanasius to Archbishop Kenrick,
from Cyril of Alexandria to Archbishop
Spaulding of Baltimore, picked
up the glove which Dr. Brownson has
flung down upon the field of controversy,
replied to Wiseman, refuted
Manning, and silenced Newman, it
will be time enough for us to begin
to consider the measures necessary
for making good the position we have
chosen.</p>

<p>Placing ourselves distinctly upon
the proposition, we invite attention
to certain relations which the Catholic
of to-day holds toward his race,
his country, his age, and the particular
order and condition denominated
progress, and the spirit of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>It becomes necessary under these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
aspects to consider him as a dutiful
subject of the head of the church, and
a loyal citizen of an independent
state; as a freeman, and one bound
by supreme authority; as recognizing
and obeying reason, and, in the free
exercise of that royal faculty of the
soul, surrendering certain prerogatives
of private judgment to infallibility;
as subject and at the same time sovereign,
both obeying and commanding;
submissive to the laws and acknowledging
the supremacy of a higher
law, which he is prepared to vindicate
with property, liberty, and life, if
the two come in conflict upon any vital
point in which he or the church is
concerned, in the nineteenth century,
precisely as he did in the first, the
second, or the third century.</p>

<p>The most obvious, interesting, and
important view of the Catholic in his
relations to the century is that of voter.
Suffrage, or the privilege of voting
for our rulers, and indirectly making
the laws by which we are to be governed,
is not a natural right. It is
an acquired privilege, and only becomes
a right when conveyed and
acknowledged by competent authority.
Once obtained, it cannot be
abrogated, and can only be lost by
revolution, the fruit of gross political
misconduct, or by voluntary neglect
and disuse.</p>

<p>The right of suffrage bestows special
prerogatives upon its possessors.
It superadds legislative and magisterial
functions to the obligations of
private obedience; it communicates
grace and dignity to the manly character,
imposes definite and heavy responsibilities
upon each individual,
requires the humblest citizen to participate
in the dignity of the highest
offices, and holds the most exalted
personages to a distinct accountability
to the people. It permits every
Catholic to share actively in the plans,
policy, and beneficent enterprises of
the church, and enables him in some
sense to take part in the divine government
of the universe, physical
and moral.</p>

<p>It is a specific and precious gift
bestowed on Catholics in this age and
country, and we are compelled to
stand in the full blaze of the light
of the nineteenth century, which is
rolling out its illuminated scroll before
our dazzled eyes and almost
bewildered understandings, charged
with the manifold blessings or curses
which must flow from the use or abuse
of this momentous, one might almost
say holy and hierarchical function.</p>

<p>An offer and promise are as distinctly
made to the Catholics of this
age as they were to the chosen people
when released from the Egyptian
bondage. A land of promise, a land
flowing with milk and honey, is spread
out before them, and offered for their
acceptance.</p>

<p>The means placed at their disposal
for securing this rich possession are
not the sword, or wars of extermination
waged against the enemies of
their religion, but instead, the mild
and peaceful influence of the ballot,
directed by instructed Catholic conscience
and enlightened Catholic intelligence.</p>

<p>A careful consideration of this subject
is particularly important at the
present epoch and century.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century is interesting
to us because it is <em>ours</em>; because
it is the expression and exponent of
much that has been dark and obscure
in the past, because it is the most
fruitful and bountiful in material resources
and advantages of any of
which we possess authentic knowledge,
because it shines glorious amidst the
centuries by its own intrinsic light,
and by the light derived from modern
discoveries, investigations, and interpretations
thrown back upon the past,
and by it reflected in turn upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
present. It is especially important
to us as Catholics, inasmuch as it
seems to be a critical era in the religious
history of the human race, and
to have been selected by Providence
as a new point of departure in many
important particulars of his dealings
with mankind.</p>

<p>The radical questions of the relations
between the supernatural and
the natural, faith and reason, Rome
and the world, justice and injustice;
between the material and transitory,
and the immaterial and permanent;
between that which is unchangeable in
principle and those things which are
progressive in action; between church
and state, God and man, are sharply
defined, boldly stated, pushed to their
ultimate, logical, and practical extremes,
and presented with all the arguments,
inducements, promises, and
threatenings of the most learned and
eloquent advocates of the opposing
causes to each individual Catholic for
his election.</p>

<p>The issue is as distinctly placed before
his mind as it was in the case of
our first parents in Eden, of Europe
in the religious revolution of the sixteenth
century, of England in the
days of Henry VIII. and his anti-Catholic
successors.</p>

<p>It is a question of instant and
pressing importance, which demands
an immediate and definite answer. It
must be met and answered by the Catholic
of to-day, since to him are
committed the obligation and business
of perpetuating and regenerating
society, purifying legislation, enforcing
the administration of the laws,
and setting an example of private and
public virtue, justice, moderation, and
forbearance. He has been furnished
with an omnipotent weapon with
which to accomplish this great work,
and he is provided with an unerring
guide to direct him in the administration
of these important trusts. We
do not hesitate to affirm that in performing
our duties as citizens, electors,
and public officers, we should always
and under all circumstances act simply
as Catholics; that we should be
governed and directed by the immutable
principles of our religion, and
should take dogmatic faith and the
conclusions drawn from it, as expressed
and defined in Catholic philosophy,
theology, and morality, as the
only rule of our private, public, and
political conduct. Those things which
are condemned by Catholic justice, we
should condemn; those things which
are affirmed, we should affirm.</p>

<p>There can be no circumstance, condition,
or relation in which the Catholic
is left without his guide, and there
is absolutely no excuse if he fail in the
performance of this duty, upon which
rests the future prosperity of civilized
society.</p>

<p>While insisting on the dignity and
obligations of suffrage, it may perhaps
be necessary to observe that the church
prescribes no specific form of government.
Government itself is required
under some form, for the reason that
we are created and fulfil our allotted
destiny under the operation of an organic
law which we have the power,
and under certain circumstances the
disposition, to violate.</p>

<p>We have no power to annul or abrogate
the organic law, and its violation
in virtue of its own nature, and
our responsibility entails specific penalties
in time, and, as it is eternal in
its origin and action, eternity. The
superiority of the human race, and the
merit and honor of obedience, reside
in the power of choice, and the ability
which we possess to decide our
temporal and eternal destiny, and renew
and perfect, or reject and obliterate
our relations with the Creator.
A happy, prosperous, and peaceful
temporal condition is not guaranteed,
nor is it essential to true well-being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
but these most desirable concomitants
of earthly existence necessarily accompany
and flow from the enforcement
of the requirements of the organic
law upon our own conduct and that
of others less disposed to obey them.</p>

<p>All human government rests upon
this basis, whether of patriarch, prophet,
priest, king, chieftain, pope, bishop,
emperor, or people in organized
assembly.</p>

<p>The principle underlying every form
of government is that of command
and obedience, because the government
of the universe is one of law.
Both command and obedience are of
the same nature and alike honorable,
because there can be but one source
of law, and that is God; and he in his
humanity obeyed the laws of his own
creation in his divinity, and personally
fulfilled the obligations of his own imposition.
Who is he who despises obedience,
when the Son of Man became
obedient to the death of the cross?</p>

<p>All legislation in harmony with the
organic law is theocratic and divine;
all in violation or opposition, precisely
in the measure and degree of departure,
unjust, cruel, tyrannical, false,
vain, unstable, and weak, and not entitled
to respect or obedience.</p>

<p>Since justice and our honor and
dignity require that we should obey
God, and not man, we are compelled
by every reasonable motive to ascertain
his will. He does not communicate
personally and orally with creatures.</p>

<p>Unless we have the means of ascertaining
with certainty what his wishes
are on a given subject, whether of the
private practice of virtue or the administration
of a public duty, we are
left to the direction of opinions, interests,
and passions more or less superficially
instructed and enlightened,
and tend inevitably toward barbarism,
despotism, and social and political disorganization.
The Catholic Church
is the medium and channel through
which the will of God is expressed.
The chain of communication, composed
of the triple strand of revelation,
inspiration, and faith, stretches underneath
the billows of eternity to the
shore of time, from the throne of God
to the chair of Peter. The finger of the
pope, like the needle in the compass,
invariably points to the pole of eternal
truth, and the mind of the sovereign
pontiff is as certain to reflect the mind
and will of God as the mirror at one
end of a submarine cable to indicate
the electric signal made at the other.</p>

<p>The will of God is expressed as
plainly through the church as it was
through Moses and the tables of the
law. It is distinct, definite, intelligible,
and precise, and we are bound to execute
the will thus expressed, and act
in the light of the intelligence thus
supplied.</p>

<p>All legislation which has stood the
test of time has flowed from the divinely-inspired
fountain of natural justice,
illuminated by her wisdom, corrected
by her experience, interpreted
by her theology and philosophy.
All tyranny, injustice, force, cruelty,
violence, and oppression follow as the
result of violation of the organic law
as interpreted by the church, or from
systems of legislation in opposition to,
or abrogation of, her eternal principles.</p>

<p>While immunity from temporal suffering
is nowhere promised, it is nevertheless
true that the greater portion
of evils and sorrows are capable of
prevention or relief.</p>

<p>Wealth can be deprived of its satiety,
poverty of its sting, labor of its
pain, ease of its slothfulness, learning
of its pride, power of its arrogance,
ignorance of its stupidity.</p>

<p>But though we expect no natural
Utopia or earthly paradise, we are no
less bound to oppose and correct
vices, sorrows, evils, dangers, and oppressions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
as they spring, ever fierce
and relentless, with their countless
heads, whether personal, social, national,
or legislative.</p>

<p>The Catholic armed with his vote
becomes the champion of faith, law,
order, social and political morality,
and Christian civilization, no less&mdash;in
fact, a greater degree, for our present
enemies are more dangerous&mdash;than his
ancestor who hung a wallet over his
leathern jerkin, and, shouldering his
halberd, followed the lord of the manor
to Palestine; than he who aided the
Catholic Ferdinand and Isabella to
drive the Moor from the soil of Christian
Spain, or, under John Sobieski,
rolled back the tide of Mohammedan
invasion from the European shores of
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>He goes forth furnished with this
weapon, which, faithfully and honorably
employed, must become invincible,
arrest the swollen current of corruption,
crime, and lawlessness which
threatens to sweep away religion,
morality, and liberty, insure the preÃ«minence
of law, order, and republican
institutions, preserve and perfect
the results of material and natural
science, put an end to poverty in its
abject and hopeless forms, and banish
suffering from unrelieved want, and
develop and complete a system of
jurisprudence which shall sustain
what the world has not yet seen, a
pure republic of equal rights, exact
justice, and assured temporal prosperity,
presided over, influenced, and
informed by true religion.</p>

<p>The great and undeniably wonderful
and valuable fruits of human genius
and materialistic science, may
be utilized to meet the ends of ideal
justice, and true individual and national
prosperity and happiness.</p>

<p>With the means of instant intelligent
communication and rapid transportation,
it is not an impossibility to
hope that the head of the church
may again become the acknowledged
head of the reunited family of Christian
nations; the arbiter and judge
between princes and peoples, between
government and government, the exponent
of the supreme justice and
highest law, in all important questions
affecting the rights, the interests,
and the welfare of communities and
individuals.</p>

<p>Under such a system, force would
give place to reason; the nations
would learn war no more, and a
general disarmament could be safely
imposed. The door of the temple
of the demon god of war, which has
stood open since Cain imbrued his
fratricidal hands in the blood of Abel,
would be closed for ever.</p>

<p>Although we are far from expecting
a result grand, glorious, and wonderful,
realizing in the highest degree
the promise made to the human race
if faithful to the object of their creation,
still we do not hesitate to assert
that it is within the power of the ballot,
wielded by Catholic hands and
directed by Catholic conscience, to
accomplish as much and more.</p>

<p>It is no more than the church has
a right to expect from her subjects;
it is no more than they owe her and
themselves; it would be a triumph
worthy of the nineteenth century, and
worthy of a fallen race deemed worthy
to be redeemed by the blood of
a God.</p>

<p>The two great questions of marriage
and education present themselves
in a discussion of the relations
which the Catholic sustains toward
civil society, as elements of prime
and indispensable importance. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
can be no permanent Christian society,
no civilized and enduring government,
which are not perpetuated by
Catholic marriage, elevated, instructed,
and disciplined by Catholic education.
The great civilizations which
have arisen and flourished independently,
vitalized by the tradition of
primitive revelation, are wanting or
have forfeited the characteristics of
true civilization. Many have perished;
others have reached their term,
and the hour of their destruction is
at hand. The ancient and most remarkable
social, civil, and religious
polity of India is withering under the
remorseless touch of English rule,
and China is destined to succumb to
steam, machinery, railroads, and sewing-machines.</p>

<p>Nothing but the pure gold of Catholicity
can withstand the material
flame which burns brightest and hottest
in the nineteenth century, and it
may only survive stripped of every
earthly and human quality, attribute,
and advantage.</p>

<p>It is not in our power at this time
to follow the line of reflection suggested
by the great unchristian and
anti-christian civilizations, the Indian,
the Persian, the Chinese, and the
Mohammedan; but we must confine
ourselves to the proposition which
their history, brilliant, startling, and
splendid though it be, and, to superficial
human views, does not in any
degree invalidate, that true civilization
rests for its foundation upon Catholic
marriage and Catholic education.</p>

<p>In contradistinction from suffrage,
which is an acquired privilege, marriage
is a <em>natural</em> right. Its regulation
and control belong exclusively
to the church, and are particularly
her care and prerogative under the
supernatural order.</p>

<p>Marriage is the sacrament of nature,
as well as one of grace, and the
church insists upon her rightful control,
because she depends upon this
sacrament not only for perpetuity on
earth, but for her eternal representation.
She regulates the conditions
of marriage and witnesses the contract
in whose fulfilment she has such
a vital interest, and she becomes the
arbiter between the contracting parties
in the subsequent stages of their
career. She claims its offspring at
their birth, and immediately impresses
upon them the seal of her proprietorship
in baptism; she accompanies
them throughout their lives, and dismisses
them with unction and benediction;
she follows them into the
unseen world, and does not relax her
grasp till they attain their fruition
and become in turn protectors and
benefactors of the mother who has
given them both natural and supernatural
birth. Marriage is the crystal
fountain on earth whence flows
the perennial living stream which fertilizes
and makes glad the plains of
heaven.</p>

<p>The Catholic view, or Christian idea
of marriage, implies by necessity the
Catholic view of all the relations and
obligations growing out of it: the education
of the young, the custody of
foundlings and orphans, and all measures
of correction and reformation
applicable to youthful offenders and
disturbers of the peace of society.</p>

<p>The same view would consign to
her care the permanent infants of
society, the idiotic, those defective
in important organs or senses, the insane,
the criminal, the sick poor, and
the helpless and wretched of every
class. The church is capable, through
her orders and congregations of men
and women, of undertaking these
trusts. There is in this work occupation
for all who have not definite
vocations, and for the aid and assistance
of those who have. It is a species
of labor which has never been
efficiently and completely performed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
and can only be accomplished by
those who undertake it under the
direction of religion from the motive
of heroic and supernatural charity.
No compensation, no hope of human
reward or praise, can procure such
service, tenderness, and succor as
that which the unpaid and nameless
religious bestows upon the poor and
nameless cast-away, for the sake of
the humanity of Christ.</p>

<p>The function of education is most
closely connected with the authority
claimed and exercised over marriage.
The custodian of the tree has certainly
the right to the fruit of the
tree, and to protect it from wayfarers
and robbers.</p>

<p>The control and prevention of poverty
is an example of the profound
science of political economy which
is manifested by the church. No
state can flourish where hopeless poverty
becomes an institution.</p>

<p>A godless system of education, or,
what is the same thing, an uncatholic
system, is the more refined and
elegant but not less certain method
of modern times of offering our children
to Moloch, and causing our sons
to pass through the fire. The right
which the church exerts over education
does not in any manner impair or
contravene the legitimate authority of
parents; but, on the contrary, strengthens
and supports it, since it is an assertion
of the principle of authority
and the final obligations toward God
due from both parents and children.
It asserts the rights of parents and the
right which children have to Christian
education. Every human creature
born into the world has the inalienable
right of knowing and obeying
the truth, and seeking to attain its
own eternal happiness.</p>

<p>While parents have rights over their
children, children, in turn, have rights
as respects their parents, and the chief
of these is Christian education.</p>

<p>The church asserts and defends
these principles, and she flatly contradicts
the assumption on the part of the
state of the prerogative of education,
and determinedly opposes the effort
to bring up the youth of the country
for purely secular and temporal purposes.
The state is in its nature godless
and material, and, in accordance
with its nature, seeks only material
ends. No state or nation as such has
a supernatural destiny; its rewards
and punishments are temporary and
finite, and its views, policy, and conduct
short-sighted, corrupt, and selfish.
While the state has rights, she has them
only in virtue and by permission of
the superior authority, and that authority
can only be expressed through
the church, that is, through the organic
law infallibly announced and
unchangeably asserted, regardless of
temporal consequences. The church
yields, however, to temporal conditions
as far as she can without departing
from her organic principle. She
resembles a mighty tree tossed by
the winds, and apparently yielding to
the tempest from whatever quarter it
comes, but never giving up its roots,
firmly fixed in the ground, and stretching
their fibres far out under the surface
of things. If she could be moved
from her position, torn up by the
roots, rifted from her organic basis on
the rock of Peter, she would cease to
be the church, become a human and
fallible institution, and entitled to no
more consideration than any other
human organization or voluntary society.
The hostile and opposing
forces recognize distinctly the value
and importance to us of the two fundamental
institutions, marriage and
education. Their efforts are particularly
directed at the present time, and
in this country, to corrupt and undermine
the one and usurp complete
control over the other. The attitude
of the church on these questions is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the cause of nearly all the opposition
she encounters, of the secret and open
attacks she suffers, and of most of the
great persecutions she has experienced.
She is attacked in respect to
marriage by sensuality, and in regard
to education by the arrogance of the
state, and the jealousy which human
power always manifests of the divine
authority.</p>

<p>The order, regularity, charity, and
chastity required in marriage by the
church&mdash;and of which she is the emblem&mdash;are
repudiated by the world.</p>

<p>This repudiation is manifested by
sensuality in its protean forms, from
platonic love and sentimental and religious
melancholy, all through the
descending scale of folly, vice, and
crime to the lowest depths, whither
the mind refuses to follow and where
demons veil their faces, and by legislation
the result of this opposition,
such as is expressed in the laxity of
divorce laws, and a public sentiment
which sanctions and countenances
divorce and the marriage of divorced
parties. It is more or less boldly
or covertly expressed in almost the
whole range of anti-catholic and uncatholic
literature, and in the increasing
license of conversation, manners,
and amusements. Marriage has lost
its dignity and sanctity by being divested
of its sacramental character,
and its manifest and natural duties
and obligations are shunned, despised,
and disregarded by a large proportion
of those living in outward regard for
decorum and morality. The spirit
of the nineteenth century, unchastened
by Catholicity, by whatever sounding
title it may be called&mdash;progress,
liberty, emancipation of the intellect,
dignity of the race, independence of
science&mdash;is a spirit of gross, cruel,
and irrational sensuality, which tends
directly and inevitably toward ignorance,
bondage, anarchy, and barbarism,
and consequent stupidity.</p>

<p>Stupidity may, perhaps, be considered
the lowest hell of a creature
originally constituted <em>active</em> and <em>intellectual</em>.</p>

<p>It is directly against these elements,
whose consequences she distinctly
foresees, that the church opposes her
laws of marriage, and the absolute
supernatural chastity of her priests
and religious.</p>

<p>It is not that she forbids marriage,
as she is sometimes accused, that she
offers to certain persons the privilege
of electing a superior state and beginning
on earth the life of heaven, but
in order to provide herself with angels
and ministers of grace to do her will,
accomplish her work, perform her innumerable
acts of spiritual and corporeal
mercy, and be literally the godfathers
and godmothers to the orphaned
human race, while they obtain
for themselves and others countless
riches of merit. The spirit which
we reprobate substitutes lust for love,
philanthropy for charity. By subtracting
charity from marriage, it virtually
divorces the married, and leads
directly to the destruction of the species.
The children whom it permits
to survive it educates for material and
temporal objects alone, and the most
noble destiny it has to offer is death
on the field of battle; its highest reward,
a short-lived, temporal honor,
and a brief posthumous reputation.
The pursuits of honor, of science, literature
and art, are noble, and in some
degree satisfying. They are, when true
and real, Catholic in their nature, and
the growth of Catholic soil. Whenever&mdash;as
in pre-Christian times&mdash;they
become detached from original revelation,
or, in modern, divorced from or
hostile to Catholic inspiration, they
incline toward cruelty, false science
or incomplete science, and in literature
and art to decay. The inevitable
tendency of incomplete science,
that is, imperfect from a radical defect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
like a defective formula in mathematics,
is to error, obscurity, and confusion.
The absence of the supernatural
element is the radical defect in
all uncatholic natural and metaphysical
science; and every superstructure
erected upon it, however splendid in
appearance, is built upon the sand.</p>

<p>The reason why civil marriage,
state religion and education, natural
society, and material science do not
become more rapidly corrupt, and
manifest more speedily their inherent
defects, is on account of the vast
amount of latent Catholicity which
they retain, and without which they
could not survive a single day.</p>

<p>It is the tendency of the natural to
consume the supernatural, in its efforts
to attain its destiny, and, unless fed by
new infusions of the divine element, to
sink lower and lower toward the
abyss.</p>

<p>It is the function of the supernatural
society, that is, the church through
her ministry and sacraments, to furnish
continual supplies of this divine
element, to antagonize the decomposition
which followed close upon the
steps of the terrible twin brethren, sin
and death, when they entered the
world; renew the almost exhausted
life of the soul, and enable it to rise
higher and higher, till it is absorbed
once more into the source of life eternal,
from whence it sprang.</p>

<p>The more respectable and conservative
of the uncatholic institutions,
which retain most of the latent Catholicity
not yet expended in three
centuries of separation from the parent
fountain, preserve many Catholic
ideas, customs, and forms of speech
and action.</p>

<p>Such publications as the <cite>New-Englander</cite>,
the <cite>Princeton</cite>, <cite>Mercersburg</cite>, and
<cite>North British Reviews</cite>, advocate to a
great extent the Christian doctrines
of marriage and education, and the
superiority of religion in all temporal
and secular affairs, and deprecate,
without the power to remedy or arrest,
the evils which they acknowledge
to exist.</p>

<p>The advanced portion of the opposing
forces, they who have expended
their latent Catholicity, denied the
faith and impugned the truth, and
sunk to the lowest level compatible
with life, do not seek to defend their
position by any hollow appeals to religion
or conscience, but boldly deny
all authority excepting their own depraved
wills.</p>

<p>Red-republicanism, Fourierism,
communism, free love, Mormonism,
the Oneida community, the false sciences
of mesmerism and phrenology,
spiritism and sentimental philanthropy,
are exemplary expressions of the
forms which sensuality and the denial
of authority assume in their retrograde
metamorphoses.</p>

<p>The woman's rights movement is
the most subtle, dangerous, and
treacherous of the later manifestations
of the evil spirit of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>It is more threatening to the public
peace than the abolition agitation was
at its commencement, and is fostered
and fomented by the same or kindred
influences, and under some one or
other of its forms and phases comprehends
every falsehood, error, delusion,
and heresy, from the original lie
uttered in Eden to the last invented
and promulgated by the Satanic press.
It has a certain, irresistible tendency
to vitiate suffrage, degrade legislation,
disturb society, abolish religion, superinduce
crime, disease, insanity, idiocy,
physical decay, deformity, suicide and
early death, abrogate matrimony and
extinguish the race.</p>

<p>Every count in this terrible charge
is capable of being sustained by the
most abundant evidence in history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
analogy, facts of daily experience, the
declarations of religion, and evidences
of the legal and medical sciences.</p>

<p>It is absolutely anti-catholic and
unchristian, and could not exist, much
less flourish, in an age not far gone on
the road to ruin.</p>

<p>It is the Catholic Church, and she
alone, which guarantees the rights, freedom,
and honor of women. She raises
them to a participation in her ministry
and apostleship, and pledges herself
and all the power of heaven to
the protection of the humblest as well
as the most exalted of the sex, in her
rights and dignity as woman, wife,
and mother. She has suffered persecution
and dismemberment rather
than yield an iota of the vested rights
of helpless woman; she has decreed
the immaculate conception, the most
perfect testimony of the exalted function
of maternity and the crowning
human glory of the sex, and raised
one of their number to be queen of
heaven, the crowning superhuman
glory.</p>

<p>All that woman can claim is accorded
to her by the church, and asserted
as her indefeasible right. The only
security for woman, her only refuge
from the artifice of men and the undeniable
oppression of society, is in
the church, and the legislation deduced
from the original organic law; in
the inviolability of the marriage contract,
and the sacramental character
of marriage.</p>

<p>The difficult and vexed question of
mixed education obtrudes itself upon
our attention at every step of a discussion
like the one in which we are engaged.
It is not our purpose to enter
upon its details at present. The
chief pastors in solemn council assembled
will undoubtedly decide upon
the line of conduct most expedient
for us to follow. While asserting the
absolute dependence of natural science
for its truth and perpetuity upon divine
illumination, we do not intend
to disparage human learning and the
pursuits of philosophy and science.
Philosophy on the intellectual and
natural sciences is the most elevating
and ennobling of human employments.
As truth is simple in its nature
and essence, every truth discovered,
learned, and elaborated tends
to draw the soul toward God. There
is and can be no quarrel or discrepancy
between revelation and science.
The truths of revelation and the truths
of science tend infallibly toward mutual
illustration and final unity. It
is only the effect of false science or
imperfect science to divert the mind
from God, the origin of truth, or truth
itself, and enter upon the path which
leads to error, doubt, ignorance, and
darkness.</p>

<p>The supremacy asserted for the
church in matters of education implies
the additional and cognate function
of the censorship of ideas, and the
right to examine and approve or disapprove
all books, publications, writings,
and utterances intended for public
instruction, enlightenment, or entertainment,
and the supervision of places
of amusement.</p>

<p>This is the principle upon which the
church has acted in handing over to
the civil authority for punishment <i>criminals
in the order of ideas</i>.</p>

<p>It is the principle upon which
every civilized government acts in
emergencies, and it was asserted rigorously
and unsparingly North and
South during the recent revolution.
It is the principle upon which a father
would act in expelling summarily
and ignominiously from his house a
person detected in corrupting the
minds, manners, and morals of his
children. It is in fact nothing more
than the principle of self-preservation,
which is the first law of nature. It is
not necessary to raise the question
whether this principle has been abused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
by individuals for mistaken or corrupt
objects. It is safe to say that it
has been. The admission in no way
invalidates the right and obligation
involved. There are few good things
which men have not abused.</p>

<p>Crimes, cruelties, oppressions and
persecutions (especially in the order
of ideas) are laid at the door of the
Catholic Church, which are the fruit
of human passion, avarice, ambition,
and resentment, and that strange and
devilish infatuation of cruelty which
sometimes seizes upon a whole community,
and which is analogous to
the destructive and suicidal insanities
of individuals. The church, however,
in her official and organic character,
has never abused this principle
or any other, whether of discipline or
policy. These moral and political
catastrophes are wholly independent
of Catholicity, are in direct violation
of religion, and in disobedience to
the commands and entreaties of the
church.</p>

<p>Government and legislation informed,
directed, and guided by Catholic
justice is the most humane, benignant,
equal, just, merciful, and forbearing
of any that can possibly exist,
and the temporal government of
the head of the church is to-day the
best in the world.</p>

<p>These subjects bring us back to
the question of suffrage, and to the
Catholic as voter. It is necessary
that we should have just laws, primarily
and immediately in regard to
education and marriage, and that they
should have the sanction of sound
public opinion, without which the
best laws are inoperative.</p>

<p>These laws must grow out of the
Catholic conscience of the community,
if they are to grow at all.</p>

<p>The labor of strengthening these
foundations of society belongs to the
Catholic voter, and to him we must
look for future safety, peace, and permanence.
Every principle of justice
is assailed, every bulwark is undermined.</p>

<p>Social eminence, literary ability,
exalted political station, and so-called
religion combine to give public
sanction to unblushing and monstrous
adultery, and brand the scarlet letter
upon a soul already crimson with
guilt as it trembles on the verge of
eternity.</p>

<p>Every species and form of vice,
crime, and corruption are paraded
and presented under disguises, more
or less specious or flimsy, of science,
literature, religion, or art.</p>

<p>The old are divested of gravity
and reserve, and the young have lost
the freshness, the sweetness, the innocence,
the candor, and the bloom
which should belong to youth.</p>

<p>The burlesque is invoked with horrid
incantation to degrade the reason,
paralyze the understanding, and brutalize
the imagination, and oriental
lasciviousness to apply the torch of
passion to the intellectual and moral
ruins.</p>

<p>Current literature is penetrated with
the spirit of licentiousness, from the
pretentious quarterly to the arrogant
and flippant daily newspaper, and the
weekly and monthly publications are
mostly heathen or maudlin. They
express and inculcate, on the one
hand, stoical, cold, and polished pride
of mere intellect, or, on the other,
empty and wretched sentimentality.
Some employ the skill of the engraver
to caricature the institutions and offices
of our religion, and others to
exhibit the grossest forms of vice and
the most distressing scenes of crime
and suffering.</p>

<p>The illustrated press has become
to us what the amphitheatre was to
the Romans when men were slain,
women were outraged, and Christians
given to the lions to please a
degenerate populace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>It is obvious, then, if what we have
said be true, that there is a great
work for the Catholic voter to perform.</p>

<p>The Constitution and Declaration
of Independence guarantee life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.
The Catholic values his life that he
may devote it to the service of the
church, and, if required, offer it for
her safety and honor; liberty, to be
and remain Catholic, enjoy freedom
in the exercise of his religion, and
transmit this priceless inheritance unimpaired
to his descendants; the
pursuit of happiness, that he may
attain the happiness of heaven!</p>

<p>The Catholic voter meditates no
invasion of vested rights. The constitution
and government of the United
States have the approval of the
holy see. The Catholic is satisfied
with the laws of his country, and
only dissatisfied with local legislation,
which contravenes the implied
pledges of the constitution and the
common law, based upon the canon
law.</p>

<p>He demands nothing that natural
justice and the legitimate interpretation
of the constitution do not guarantee
him. Freedom in religion entitles
him to protection against open
and secret attacks upon what he
holds most dear, under the guise of
state education, and which are invariably
made in every system of
uncatholic or infidel education. The
great majority of English-speaking
Catholics have had a personal and
national experience of the bitter fruit
of systems of education divorced from
the control of the church, and in the
French revolution they recognize the
results of infidel science, literature,
and sentiment practically applied to
the reformation of society. France
gave the world a terrible illustration
of the violent, frantic creed and futile
efforts which humanity makes
when it would be sufficient for itself
and become its own redeemer.
France almost expired. Her Catholicity
alone saved her. The Goths
and Vandals entered Paris, but were
compelled to retire. They entered
ancient Rome, and remained.</p>

<p>With these truths, lessons, and experiences
before his mind, the Catholic
anxiously considers the subject
of public education, and is resolved
when the question is adjudicated to
sustain the decision of the church. If
he cannot peacefully enact legitimate,
equal, and just regulations, he will
consent to bear, as he has done before,
a double burden; but he, for his
part, will make sure that his children
are taught to discriminate between
the specious and false assertions which
are put forth as history and history
itself, between human philanthropy
and divine charity, between communism
and the communion of saints, between
spiritism and those things which
are spiritual, between pure, noble, and
lovely sentiments and a rotting sentimentalism,
between the false and the
true, injustice and justice, the human
and the divine.</p>

<p>By an extraordinary example of
divine justice, and the operation of
the law of compensation, the men
and their descendants who uprooted
Catholicity in England and Ireland;
who extinguished, as far as they were
able, Catholic literature and tradition;
who destroyed the venerable seats of
learning and charity, sacked the monasteries
and despoiled the abbeys,
were compelled to prepare a home
for Catholics, and establish a political
order most acceptable to them,
and capable under Catholic auspices
of attaining the highest degree of
temporal happiness and prosperity.</p>

<p>The men who composed the Protector's
famous Ironsides levelled the New
England forests and subdued the savage,
and now in every city, village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
and hamlet of this fair land the cross
which they tore down again rises
aloft, the first to kindle in the saluting
beams of the morning sun, the last to
detain his parting lingering rays, and
thousands of happy, prosperous people
the descendants of those whom
Cromwell's dragoons trampled under
their bloody hoofs, assemble around
that altar and assist at that mass
which he could not abide.</p>

<p>The grim old regicide who sleeps
his last sleep on the green behind
Centre church, in New Haven, if he
could rise from his grave some pleasant
Sunday morning, would believe
that time and old ocean had both been
rolled away, and that he was in merry,
happy Catholic England of five hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>The past has been vindicated;
wrongs have been righted.</p>

<p>The uncompromising defence of
the rights of Queen Catharine is justified.
The Goddess of Reason, in
the person of a prostitute, enthroned
on the high altar of Notre Dame, has
given place to a Catholic lady, wife,
mother, and queen, who reigns enthroned
in the hearts of her people,
the type of every royal, womanly, and
Christian virtue.</p>

<p>Absolute CÃ¦sarism itself, touched
by Catholic justice, has voluntarily
conceded constitutional government,
and the successor of him who was
both the child and the victim of the
revolution, who dragged Pius VII.
from the chair of Peter to a French
prison, upholds the chief of the apostles
as he sits to-day enthroned prince
and patriarch and apostle of the assembled
and united episcopate of the
world.</p>

<p>It is time for Catholics to cease
complaining. The church is vindicated.
They are vindicated. Reason,
science, and religion are united in a
species of intellectual trinity, capable
of presiding over and directing all
human, temporal, and eternal destinies.
All that remains is for the individual
Catholic, the Catholic voter,
to play well his part in the drama
whose acts are realities, whose curtain
will never fall, and where the only
change of scene will be when the
vault of the heavens parts in twain
and the splendor of the eternal world
bursts upon his enraptured vision.</p>

<p>It is in the power of the Catholic
voter of the nineteenth century to
achieve a consummation such as perhaps
saints and prophets have dreamed,
but never seen. It is your part,
Catholic freemen and electors, to
perpetuate the latest and most perfect
effort in the human science of
government&mdash;the constitution of our
glorious and beloved country; to
check the current of corruption in
literature, manners, and politics.</p>

<p>It is in your power to arrest the
progress of demoralizing and disintegrating
legislation on the subject of
marriage and suffrage, and to provide
the means for the permanent endowment
of colleges, seminaries, and universities.
It is in your power to elect
able, honest, and virtuous men to office,
and to reunite the principles of
government with the principles of
religion.</p>

<p>Will you respond to the offer which
is made you in this country and the
nineteenth century, and perfect and
complete what may not unlikely be
the last opportunity for achieving
temporal prosperity in harmony with
Catholic justice?</p>

<h2>DION AND THE SIBYLS.<br />

<small>A CLASSIC, CHRISTIAN NOVEL.</small></h2>

<p class="center">BY MILES GERALD KEON, COLONIAL SECRETARY, BERMUDA, AUTHOR OF
"HARDING THE MONEY-SPINNER," ETC.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p>A short silence followed the concurring
exclamations of Thellus and
our hero, recorded in the last chapter;
and then the lanista said,</p>

<p>"Before I leave you, I will speak
one word which came of the chance
of uttering while I brought you that
letter, but which I would not have
pronounced had I found you to be
a person of a different sort. You are
really Tiberius's prisoner, remember,
although it is to Velleius Paterculus
you have given your parole. I
know, by personal experience and
much observation, the men and the
things of which you, on the other
hand, can have only a suspicion.
Now, I conjecture, it is hardly for your
own sake that you are in custody.
Beware of what may happen to those
dear to you; and as they have given
no parole, send them to some place
of safety, some secret place. There
is no place safe in itself in the known
world. Roman liberty is no more;
secrecy is the sole safety remaining.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vale</i>."</p>

<p>With these words the lanista departed,
leaving our young friend buried in
thought. As he left the court of the
impluvium to seek his mother, he remarked
that Claudius had returned
thither, and was occupied in watering
some flowers in pots at the opposite
angle. "I wonder," thought he,
"can that fellow have overheard Thellus?"</p>

<p>Other and more important matters,
however, were destined to invite his
attention. We have said enough to
justify us in passing over with a few
words every interval void of more
than ordinary daily occurrences of the
age and land. What has been related
and described will sufficiently enable
a reader of intelligence to realize
the sort of life which lay before Paulus,
his mother, and Agatha during
the next few days passed by them together
at the inn of the Hundreth
Milestone.</p>

<p>Of course, Paulus detailed to his
mother what he had observed or
heard, especially Thellus's warning.
Further, he propounded thereon his
own conclusions. The family thought
it well to summon Crispina and Crispus
to a council; and it was finally
resolved that Aglais should at once
write to her brother-in-law, Marcus
Ãmilius Lepidus, the ex-triumvir, and
ask a temporary home under his roof
for herself and Agatha, with their female
slave Melena. Old Philip and
Paulus could remain at the inn for
some time longer. Aglais, Paulus,
and the worthy couple who kept the
inn consulted together, carrying their
conferences rather far into the night,
when the business of the hostelry was
over, upon the question what would
be the best course to pursue, should
the triumvir, from timidity or any
other motive, refuse shelter to his
brother's widow and child? During
these conferences Agatha and Benigna
went to sit apart, each engaged in
some kind of needle-work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>It did not seem to the little council
probable that Lepidus would refuse
the request submitted to him, and if
he acceded to it, Crispina assured
Aglais that the castle of Lepidus at
Monte Circello, covering both the
summit and the base of a cliff upon
the edge of the sea, was sufficiently
capacious, intricate, and labyrinthine
to conceal a good part of a Roman legion
in complete security.</p>

<p>Moreover, it had escapes both by
land and by water; nor could any one
approach it without being visible to
the inmates for miles. "Considering,"
reasoned Crispina, "that there is no
pretext for ostensibly demanding the
surrender of the ladies, who have not
committed any offence, and are not,
or at all events are not supposed to
be, under any supervision, this retreat
will afford all the security that can be
desired. But Master Paulus must
never go near you when once you
leave this roof."</p>

<p>Aglais admitted the wisdom of the
suggestion. A letter, a simple, elegant,
and affecting composition, was
written by her, and intrusted to Crispus
for transmission. However, as
it was the unanimous opinion of all
concerned that the family ought not
to be detected in any communications
with Lepidus, or even suspected of any,
it was necessary for Crispus to observe
great caution in forwarding the document.
Several days, therefore, passed
away before an opportunity was
presented of sending a person who
would neither be observed in going,
nor missed when gone, and who could
at the same time be implicitly trusted;
none but old Philip could be found.</p>

<p>Crispus had been on the point of
employing Claudius for the purpose,
when Crispina resolutely stopped him.
"I have a high opinion of that youth,"
said she, "or I would not consent
that Benigna should marry him; but
at present he is a slave, and a slave
of the very person against whom we
are guarding. Moreover, Claudius
is young and very timid; he has his
way to make, and all his hopes are
dependent on this tyr&mdash;I mean the
prince. I do not wish even Benigna
to know any thing about the present
business. The more honest any young
people are, the more they betray
themselves, if cross-questioned about
matters which they know, but have
been told to conceal. If they know
nothing, why, they can tell nothing,
and moreover none can punish or
blame them for not telling.</p>

<p>"A silent tongue, husband, like
mine, and a simple heart like yours,
make safe necks. There, go about
your business."</p>

<p>During the delay and suspense
which necessarily followed, Paulus
fished, and took long walks through
that beautiful country, many aspects
of which, already described by us, as
they then were, have for ever disappeared.
He used to take with him
something to eat in the middle of the
day, but always returned toward evening
in time to join the last light repast
of his mother and sister. Each
evening saw them reassembled. Four
tall, exquisitely tapering poles, springing
from firm pedestals, supported four
little scallop-shaped lamps at the four
corners of their table. The supper
was often enriched by Paulus with
some delicious fresh-water fish of his
own catching. Benigna waited upon
them, and, being invariably engaged
by Agatha in lively conversation,
amused and interested the circle by
her mingled simplicity, good feeling,
and cleverness. After supper, Agatha
would insist that Benigna should stay
with them awhile, and they either all
strolled through the garden, whence
perfumes strong as incense rose in the
dewy air, or they sat conversing in
the bower which overlooked it. Then
after a while Crispina would ascend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
the garden-stairs to their landing; and
while she inquired how they all were,
and told them any news she might
have gathered, Benigna would steal
silently down to say good-night, as
Agatha declared, to some shadowy
figure who was dimly discernible standing
not far away among the myrtles,
and apparently contemplating the
starry heavens. Such was their quiet
life, such the tenor of those fleeting
days.</p>

<p>One evening&mdash;the sweet evening
of a magnificent autumn day&mdash;Paulus
was returning across the country,
with a rod and line, from a distant
excursion upon the banks of the Liris.
The spot which he had chosen that
day for fishing was a deep, clear, silent
pool, formed by a bend of the
river. A clump of shadowy chestnuts
and hornbeam grew nigh, and
the water was pierced by the deep
reflections of a row of stately poplars,
which mounted guard upon its margin.
There seated, his back supported
against one of the trees, watching
the float of his line as it quivered
upon the surface of the beautiful
stream, he heard no sound but the
ripple of the little waves lapping on
the reeds, the twittering of birds, and
the hum of insects. There, with a
mind attuned by the peaceful beauties
of the solitary scene, he had traversed a
thousand considerations. He thought
of the many characters with whom he
had so suddenly been brought into
more or less intercourse or contact.
He thought much of Thellus, and of
his poor Alba, so cruelly sacrificed.
He was puzzled by Claudius. He
mused about Sejanus, about Tiberius,
about Velleius Paterculus, about the
two beautiful ladies in the litters; he
thought of the third gold-looking palanquin
and its pallid occupant; of the
haughty and violent, yet, as it seemed,
servile patrician and senator, who
had attempted suddenly to kill him,
out of zeal for CÃ¦sar; of the singular
reverse which had awaited the attempt;
of Queen Berenice, and Herod
Agrippa, and Herodias; of the various
unexpected incidents and circumstances
which had followed. He
thought of his uncle Lepidus; of the
fate, whatever it might be, now to attend
his mother, his sister, and himself.
He revolved the means of establishing
his rights and his claims.
Ought he at once to employ some
able orator and advocate, and to
appeal to the tribunals of justice?
Should he rather seek a hearing from
the emperor in person, and, if so, how
was this to be managed?</p>

<p>From recollections and calculations,
the spirit of his pastime and the genius
of the place bore him away and lured
him into the realm of day-dreams,
vague and far-wandering! Up-stream,
about a mile from where he was sitting,
towered high a splendid mansion.
On its roof glittered its company
of gilt and colored statues, conversing
and acting above the top of a
wood.</p>

<p>In that mansion his forefathers had
lived.</p>

<p>On one of the streams lay ancient
Latium, where he sat, teeming with
traditions&mdash;a monster or a demigod
in every tree, rock, and river; the cradle
of the Roman race, the seed and
germ of outspreading conquest and
universal empire. On the opposite
banks was unrolled, far to the south,
the Campanian landscape, where Hannibal,
the most terrible of Romish enemies
and rivals, had enervated his victorious
legions, and lost the chances
of that ultimate success which would
have changed the destinies of mankind.</p>

<p>Suddenly, among the statues on the
roof, Paulus beheld, not bigger than
children by comparison, moving figures
of men and ladies in dazzling attire.
He perceived that salutations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
were exchanged, groups formed and
groups dispersed. Happening, the
next moment, to cast his eye over
the landscape, he saw in the distance
some horsemen galloping toward the
house, through the trees in the distance.
Losing sight of them behind
intervening clumps of oleander, myrtle,
and other shrubs, he turned once
more to watch the groups upon the
roof. In a short time new figures
seemed to arrive, around whom all
the others gathered with the attitude
and air of listening.</p>

<p>Paulus felt as if he was assisting at
a drama. A moment later the roof
was deserted by its living visitors, the
statues remained alone and silent,
gesticulating and flashing in the sun.
Tidings must have come. Something
must have happened, thought Paulus;
and, as the day was already declining,
he gathered up his fishing-tackle
and wended homeward. On
the way he met a man in hide sandals,
carrying a large staff and piked
with iron. It was a shepherd, of
whom he asked whether there was
any thing new. "Have you not
heard?" said the man; "the flocks
will fetch a better price&mdash;the emperor
has come to FormiÃ¦."</p>

<p>Full of this intelligence, and anxious
at once to consult Aglais whether,
before Augustus should leave the
neighborhood, he ought not to endeavor
by all means now to obtain a
hearing from him, Paulus mended his
pace; but while he thought he might
be the bearer of news, some news
awaited him. He passed through
the little western trellis gate into the
quoit-alley, and so by the garden toward
the house. A couple of female
slaves, who were talking and laughing
about something like the impudence
of a slave, and depend on it a
love-letter it is, but it's Greek, which
seemed to afford them much amusement,
stood at the door of the lower
arbor, which inclosed the foot of the
stairs leading up to the landing of his
mother's apartments. Noticing him,
they hastily went about their business
in different directions, and he ran up
the stairs, and found his mother and
sister talking in low tones, just inside
the open door of the upper arbor in
the large sitting-room, which, as the
reader knows, was also the room
where they took their meals.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have returned,
Paulus," said his mother. "Look at
this; your sister found it about half
an hour ago on the landing in the
arbor."</p>

<p>And Aglais handed him a piece of
paper, on which was written, in a
clear and elegant hand, in Greek:</p>

<p>"<i>When power and craft hover in
the air as hawks, let the ortolans and
ground-doves hide.</i>"</p>

<p>Our hero read the words, turned
the paper over, read the words again,
and said, "I don't see the meaning
of this. It is some scrap of a school-boy's
theme, perhaps."</p>

<p>"School-boys do not often write
such a hand," said Aglais; "nor is
the paper a scrap torn off&mdash;it is a
complete leaf. And, again, why
should it be found upon our landing?"</p>

<p>"What school-boys could come up
our stairs? There are none in the inn,
are there? Have you been in all
day?" asked Paulus.</p>

<p>"No; we were returning from a
walk across the fields to see the place
near Cicero's villa of Formianum,
where the assassins overtook him, and
as Agatha, who ran up-stairs before
me, reached the landing, she observed
something white on the ground, and
picked it up. It was that paper.
Some stranger must have been up-stairs
while we were away."</p>

<p>"Crispus or Crispina would not
have said this to us by means of an
anonymous writing. They have given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
us the same warning without disguise,
personally."</p>

<p>"But they spoke only according
to their own opinion," returned Paulus.
"Coming from some one else,
the same advice acquires yet greater
importance. Some unknown person
bears witness of the danger which
our host and hostess merely suspect,
and at which Thellus, the lanista,
hinted, as perhaps impending, but
which even he did not affirm to be a
reality."</p>

<p>"That is," added Paulus, "if this
bit of paper has been intended for us&mdash;I
mean for you and for Agatha,
because I am not a ground-dove."</p>

<p>"Well, I do not see," said the lady,
musing, "what more we can do for
the moment. Our trusty Philip is on
the way with my letter to your uncle;
he may be by this time on the way
back. Till he returns, what can we
do?"</p>

<p>"I know not," said Paulus. "Have
you asked Crispina about this paper?"</p>

<p>"We waited first to consult you,"
said Aglais; "and," added Agatha,
"there is another singular thing&mdash;we
have not seen Benigna all day, who
was so regular in attending upon us.
The hostess told us that Benigna was
suffering with a bad headache; and
when I wanted to go and tend her,
Crispina hindered me, saying she
had lain down and was trying to
sleep."</p>

<p>"What about the lover?" inquired
Paulus&mdash;"the slave Claudius?"</p>

<p>"He has gone away all of a sudden,
though his holiday has not expired. I
really suspect that Benigna and he
must have had a quarrel, and that this
is why he has left the place, and why
Benigna is so ill."</p>

<p>The <i>clepsydra</i>, or water-clock, on
the floor in a corner, showed that it
was now past the time when their
evening repast was usually prepared.
They were wondering at the delay,
when Crispus, first knocking at the
door which led from the passage, entered.
He seemed alarmed. They
put various questions to him which
the circumstances rendered natural,
showing him the paper that had been
dropped on the landing. He said
that he thought he could make
a pretty good surmise about that
matter; but inasmuch as Benigna,
who had been crying out her little
heart, was much better, and had declared
she would come herself when
they had supped, and tell them every
thing, he would prefer to leave the
recital to her, if they would permit
him.</p>

<p>Meantime he confirmed the news
that the emperor had arrived at the
neighboring town, that the festivities
had begun at the Mamurran palace,
and that in a day or two the public
part of the entertainments, the shows
and battles of the circus, which
would last for several successive
mornings and evenings, would be
opened. He said it was usual to publish
a sort of promissory plan of these
entertainments; and he expected to
receive, through the kindness of a
friend at court, (a slave,) some copies
of the document early next morning,
when he would hasten to place it in
their hands. While thus speaking to
them with an air of affected cheerfulness,
he laid the table for supper. Actuated
by a curiosity in which a good
deal of uneasiness was mingled, since
he would not himself tell them all
they desired to know, they requested
him to go and send Benigna as soon
as possible; and when at last he retired
with this injunction, they took
their supper in unbroken silence.</p>

<p>Benigna came. The secret was
disclosed, and it turned slow-growing
apprehension into present and serious
alarm.</p>

<p>"What! Claudius a spy! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
spy of Tiberius set as a sort of secret
sentry over us! Who would have
thought it?"</p>

<p>Benigna, turning very red and very
pale by turns, had related what she
had learnt, and how she had acted.
Little knowing either the secret ties
between her mother and this half-Greek
family, or the interest and affection
she had herself conceived for
them, her lover had told her that she
might help most materially in a business
of moment intrusted to him by
his master; adding that, if he gave
the CÃ¦sar satisfaction in this, he
should at once obtain his liberty, and
then they might be married. She
answered that he must know how
ready she was to further his plans,
and bade him explain himself, in order
that she might learn how to
afford him immediately the service
which he required. But no sooner
had she understood what were his
master's commands, than she was
filled with consternation. She informed
him that her father and mother
would submit to death rather
than betray the last scions of the
Ãmilian race, and that she herself
would spurn all the orders of Tiberius
before she would hurt a hair of
their heads. She mentioned, with a
little sob, that she had further informed
Claudius that she never would
espouse a man capable of plotting
mischief against them. Upon this
announcement Claudius had behaved
in a way "worthy of any thing." He
there and then took an oath to renounce
the mission he had undertaken.
He had neither known its
objects nor suspected its villainy.
But Benigna, whose mind he thus relieved,
he filled with a new anxiety
by expressing his conviction that
Tiberius CÃ¦sar would forthwith destroy
him. However, of this he had
now gone to take his chance.</p>

<p>"Did Claudius," asked Paulus,
"intend to tell the CÃ¦sar that he disapproved
of the service upon which
he had been sent, and would not help
to execute it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Benigna. "We
were a long time consulting what he
should, what he could say. He is
very timid; it is his only fault. He
is going to throw all the blame upon
me, and thus he will mention that I,
that he, that we, were going to be
married, and that, in order the more
effectually to watch the movements
of ladies to whom he personally could
get no access under this roof, the
bright notion had occurred to him to
enlist my services, so as to render it
impossible that these ladies should
escape him; or that their movements
should remain unknown, when lo! unfortunately
for his plan, he finds I love
these ladies too well to play the spy
upon them; that I refused, and even
threatened, if he did not retire from
his sentry-box forthwith, not only to
break off my nuptial engagement with
him, but to divulge to the family that
they were the objects of espial."</p>

<p>"Which you have done," said
Aglais, "even though he has complied
with your demands."</p>

<p>Poor Benigna smiled. "Yes," said
she, "I was bent upon that the instant
I knew; but what my dear,
unfortunate Claudius had to say to
Tiberius CÃ¦sar was the point. The
CÃ¦sar is not to be told every thing.
My head is bursting to think what
will happen."</p>

<p>Here she broke into a fit of crying.
They all, except Paulus, tried to comfort
her. He had started to his feet
when he first understood the one fact,
that this young girl had sacrificed not
only her matrimonial hopes, but the
very safety of her lover himself, to
the claims of honor and the laws of
friendship. He was now pacing the
width of the room in long strides
with an abstracted air, from which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
awaked every now and then to contemplate
with a thoughtful look the
anguish and terror depicted in the
innocent face of the innkeeper's little
daughter.</p>

<p>At last he stopped and said to her,</p>

<p>"Of what are you afraid?"</p>

<p>"The anger of that dreadful man."</p>

<p>"What dreadful man?"</p>

<p>She answered with a couple of sobs,</p>

<p>"The august, red-faced, big, divine
beast."</p>

<p>"But neither you nor your lover
have done any thing unlawful, any
thing wrong."</p>

<p>"That is no security," said poor
Benigna, shaking her head and wringing
her hands.</p>

<p>"That ought to be a security," said
Aglais; adding in a mutter, "but often
is a danger."</p>

<p>"It is not even allowed by people
that it ought to be a security," returned
the girl.</p>

<p>"Until it is so allowed, and so
practised too, the earth will resemble
Tartarus rather than the Elysian
Fields," said Aglais with energy.</p>

<p>Benigna began to cry amid her
sympathetic audience, and said,</p>

<p>"It was so like the Elysian Fi-fields
yesterday, and now it is like Tar-tartarus!
They will kill him."</p>

<p>"For supper, do you mean?" asked
Paulus, laying his powerful, white,
long-fingered hand upon Benigna's
head, while Agatha embraced her.
"But then, how will they cook him?
How ought a Claudius to be cooked?"</p>

<p>The young girl looked up wistfully
through her tears, and said,</p>

<p>"You do not know that awful divine
man."</p>

<p>"I think I half suspect him," answered
Paulus. "But the red-faced,
big, divine beast, as you call him, will
reward Claudius, instead of being angry
with him, and this I will show
you clearly. Was it not a proof both
of zeal and of prudence, on Claudius's
part, in the service of his master,
to endeavor to enlist your assistance?
And again, upon finding,
contrary to all likelihood&mdash;as Tiberius
himself will admit, and would be
the first to contend&mdash;that you preferred
virtue, and truth, and honor,
and good faith, to your own manifest
and immediate interests, and to success
in love&mdash;upon finding this extraordinary
and unlikely fact occurring,
was it not clearly the duty of
Claudius to his master to hasten
away at once and tell him the precise
turn which events had taken?
<i>Now, what else has been his conduct,
young damsel?</i> What, except exactly
all this, has Claudius done? Will
he not, then, be rewarded by his
master, instead of being eaten for
supper?"</p>

<p>"Ah noble sir!" cried Benigna
with clasped hands, "what wisdom
and what beautiful language the gods
have given you! This must be what
people call Greek philosophy, expounded
with Attic taste."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p>Next morning at breakfast, Paulus
announced that he had resolved to
go to FormiÃ¦ and seek an audience
of the emperor himself.</p>

<p>"How will you get one?" asked
Aglais; "and if you get one, what
good will it do you?"</p>

<p>"It will depend upon circumstances,"
he replied; "for, whether I fail
to get speech of the emperor, or, succeeding
in that, fail to get justice from
him, process of law remains equally
open, and so does process of interest.
Both means are, I suppose, always
doubtful, and generally dilatory. I
spoil no chance by trying a sudden
and direct method of recovering our
family rights; while if I succeed,
which is just possible, I shall save a
world of trouble and suspense."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>After some discussion, his mother
yielded to her son's impetuous representations,
more with the view of undeceiving
him, and reconciling him
to other proceedings, than with any
hope of a good result.</p>

<p>Paulus had taken his broad-brimmed
hat, saying that in three or four hours
he expected to be back again at the
inn; but that if he did not reappear,
they were to conclude that he had
found a lodging at FormiÃ¦, and that
he was remaining there for some good
reason; when the door was flung
open, and breathless, radiant, holding
an unfolded letter in her hand, Benigna
rushed into the room.</p>

<p>"Read, read," she cried, "and give
me joy! I was unjust to the noble
prince."</p>

<p>She handed the letter to Aglais,
who read aloud what follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">FormiÃ¦.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Ãlius Sejanus, the prÃ¦torian prefect
greets Crispus, keeper of the inn at 100
Milestone. Our CÃ¦sar is so pleased with
the slave Claudius, that he has resolved to
give him his freedom and the sum of fifty
thousand sesterces, upon which to take a
wife and to begin any calling he may prefer.
And understanding that he is engaged,
whenever he becomes a free man, to
marry your daughter Benigna, and knowing
not only that good news is doubly agreeable
when it comes from the mouth of a person
beloved, but that to the person who loves
it is agreeable also to be the bearer of it, he
desires that your daughter, whose qualities
and disposition he admires, should be the
first to tell her intended husband Claudius
of his happy fortune. Let her, therefore,
come to-morrow to FormiÃ¦, where, at the
Mamurran palace, CÃ¦sar will give her a
message which is to be at once communicated
to the slave Claudius. Farewell."</p></blockquote>

<p>"I want to go at once to FormiÃ¦,"
cried Benigna.</p>

<p>"Well, I am even now going,"
said Paulus; "and if you intend to
walk, I will guard you from any
annoyance either on the way or at
FormiÃ¦, a town which you know is
at present swarming with soldiers."</p>

<p>This offer was, of course, too valuable
not to be cheerfully accepted.</p>

<p>A few moments after the foregoing
conversation, Paulus and Benigna left
the inn of Crispus together. The roads
were full of groups of persons of all
ranks, in carriages, on horseback, and
on foot. Some of these were bound
countryward, but not one for every
score of those who were bound in
their own direction. No adventure
befell them, and in less than two hours
they arrived at their destination. It
was easy to find the Mamurran palace,
to the principal door of which, guarded
by a PrÃ¦torian sentry on either
hand, Paulus forthwith escorted Benigna.</p>

<p>There was no footway on either
side of the street, and as they approached
the door they heard the
clang of the metal knocker resound
upon <em>the inside</em>. At the same moment
the sentinel nearest to them
shouted "<i>linite</i>," (by your leave.)
Two or three persons at this warning
shrank hurriedly into the middle of
the road; a Numidian rider made his
horse bound aside, and the large folding-doors
were simultaneously flung
open outward.</p>

<p>Immediately appeared the very
man in the dark-dyed purple robe of
whom the little damsel was in quest,
and upon whose personal aspect, already
minutely described in a former
place, we need not here dwell. A
handsome gentleman, in middle life,
with an acute and thoughtful face,
who wore the Greek mantle called
<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ÏÎ»Î±á¿Î½Î±</span>, (<i>lÃ¦na</i>,) but differently shaped
from an augur's, followed. Both these
persons moved with that half-stoop
which seems like a continued though
very faint bow; and when in the street,
they turned, stood still and waited.
Then came forth, leaning on a knight's
arm, and walking somewhat feebly,
a white-haired, ancient, and majestic
man, around whose person, in striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
contrast with the many new fashions
of dress lately become prevalent, a
snowy woollen toga, with broad violet
borders, flowed. Under this toga,
indeed, was a tunic richly embroidered
with gold, and having painted upon
it the head of the idol called the Capitoline
Jove, half hidden by a wide
double stripe of scarlet silk.</p>

<p>When this personage had come into
the street, all those who chanced to
be there uncovered. Tiberius, the
gentleman in the Greek mantle, and
the knight himself upon whose arm
the object of all this reverence continued
to lean, did the same; and it
was thus that Paulus, who had already
guessed from frequent descriptions
formerly received, knew for certain
that he beheld for the first time Augustus
CÃ¦sar, sovereign of three hundred
million human beings, and absolute
master of the known world. In a
moment those who formed the personal
company of the emperor resumed
their head-gear; some soldiers who
happened to be passing did the same,
and proceeded upon their respective
errands; but the inhabitants remained
gazing until the group began to move
on foot up the street in the direction
of the temporary circus which had
been completed by the knight Mamurra
in some fields north-west of the
town.</p>

<p>Paulus turned to Benigna and said,
"You perceive the red-faced&mdash;ehem!
the great man. He does not know
you, though you know him. Shall I
tell him who you are? Indeed, I
have not come hither merely to stare
about me; so wait you here."</p>

<p>He thereupon left her, and quickly
overtaking, and then passing before,
the group in which was Augustus,
turned round and stood directly in their
way, hat in hand; but all his sensations
were different from what he had expected.
He grew very red and shamefaced,
and felt a sudden confusion that
was new to his experience. As it was
impossible to walk over him, they, on
their part, halted for a moment, and
looked at him with an expression of
surprise which was common to them
all, though indeed not in the same
degree. The person who seemed the
least astonished was the emperor; and
the person who seemed more so than
any of the rest was Tiberius. Some
displeasure, too, seemed to flash in
the glance which he bent upon the
youth.</p>

<p>But Paulus, though abashed, did
not lose presence of mind to such an
extent as to behave stupidly. He
said,</p>

<p>"I ask our august emperor's pardon
for interrupting his promenade,
in order to report to Tiberius CÃ¦sar
the execution of an order. Yonder is
Crispus's daughter, illustrious sir," he
added, turning toward Tiberius; "she
has come hither according to your
own commands."</p>

<p>"True," said Tiberius; "let her at
once seek the prefect Sejanus, who
will give the necessary instructions."</p>

<p>Paulus's natural courage and enterprising
temper had carried him
thus far; but his design of accosting
and directly addressing Augustus CÃ¦sar
now seemed, when he had more
speedily found an opportunity of doing
so than he could have dared to
hope, a strange and difficult undertaking.
How he should procure access
to the emperor had been the problem
with him and his family heretofore;
but now, when the access was already
achieved, and when he had only to
speak&mdash;now when his voice was sure
to reach the ears of the emperor himself&mdash;he
knew not what to say or how
to begin. He had thought of splendid
topics, of deductions which he
would draw, certain arguments which
he would urge&mdash;a matter very plain
and easy: in fine, a statement simple,
brief, and conclusive; but all this had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
vanished from his mind. There before
him, holding back the folds of his
toga with one white hand, upon the
back of which more than seventy
years had brought out a tracery of
blue varicose veins&mdash;a modern doctor
would call them&mdash;with the other hand,
which was gloved, and grasping the
fellow glove, laid upon the arm of the
knight already mentioned, stood the
person who, under forms, the republican
semblance of which he carefully
preserved, exercised throughout the
whole civilized and nearly the whole
known world, over at least two if not
three hundred million souls, a power
as uncontrolled and as absolute for all
practical purposes as any which, before
him or after him, ever fell to
man's lot; enthusiastically guarded
and religiously obeyed by legions before
whom mankind trembled, and
whose superiors as soldiers had not
been seen then and have not been
seen since; the perpetual tribune of
the people, the prince, senator, perpetual
consul, the supreme judge, the
arbiter of life and death, the umpire
in the greatest concerns between foreign
disputants travelling from the
ends of the earth to plead before him;
the dispenser of prefectures, provinces,
proconsulates, tetrarchies, and kingdoms;
treated by kings as those kings
were themselves treated by the high
functionaries whom they had appointed
or confirmed, and could in an instant
dismiss; the unprincipled, cruel,
wicked, but moderate-tempered, cold-humored,
cautious, graceful-mannered,
elegant-minded, worldly-wise, and
politic prince, who paid assiduous
court to all the givers and destroyers
of reputation&mdash;I mean, to the men
of letters. There he stood, as we
have described him, holding his toga
with one hand and leaning upon Mamurra's
arm with the other; and Paulus
stood before him, and Paulus knew
not what to say; hardly, indeed&mdash;so
quickly the sense of bashfulness, confusion,
depression had gained upon
him&mdash;hardly how to look.</p>

<p>"If you have heard," observed Tiberius
at length, "pray stand aside."</p>

<p>Paulus, who, while Tiberius was
speaking, had looked at him, now
glanced again toward the emperor,
and still hesitated, made a shuffling
bow, and stood partly aside.</p>

<p>"What is it you wish to say?" asked
Augustus, in a somewhat feeble
voice, not at all ungraciously.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Paulus, becoming
very pale, "to say, my sovereign, that
my father's property in this very neighborhood
was taken away after the battle
of Philippi and given to strangers,
and to beg of your justice and clemency
to give back that property or an
equivalent to me, who am my dead
father's only son."</p>

<p>"But," said Augustus smiling, "half
the land in Italy changed hands about
the time you mention. Your father
fought for Brutus, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"My father fought for you, my
lord," said Paulus.</p>

<p>"Singular!" exclaimed Augustus;
"but this is not a court of justice&mdash;the
courts are open to you."</p>

<p>At this moment Sejanus and one
whom Paulus presumed to be in
Rome, Cneius Piso, attended by a
slave, appeared from a cross street.
The slave approached quickly, holding
a pigeon; and having caught the
eye of Augustus, who beckoned to him,
he handed the bird to the emperor.</p>

<p>Paulus withdrew a little, but lingered
near the group. Augustus, disengaging
a piece of thin paper from the
pigeon's neck, said,</p>

<p>"From Illyricum, I suppose. We
shall now learn what progress those
Germans have made. O Varus, Varus!"
added he, in words which he
had of late often been heard to repeat,
"give me back the legions,
'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">redde legiones! redde legiones!</i>'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>A breathless silence lasted while
Augustus perused the message taken
from the neck of the carrier-pigeon.
As he crushed the paper in his hands,
he muttered something; and while he
muttered, the scorbutic face of Tiberius
(perhaps scrofulous would better
render the epithet used by Tacitus)
burned ominously. In what the emperor
said Paulus caught the words,
"<i>danger to Italy</i>, but Germanicus
knows how."</p>

<p>"Varus lost the legions a thousand
times, a thousand paces westward of
this irruption," said Tiberius.</p>

<p>"A calamity like that," said Augustus,
"is felt far and near. The whole
empire suffers, nor will it recover in
my time. Ah! the legions."</p>

<p>Paulus perceived that he himself
was now forgotten; moreover, looking
back, he saw the poor young damsel,
left by him at the door of the
Mamurran palace, still standing alone
and unprotected; but some fascination
riveted him.</p>

<p>In a moment a great noise was
heard, which lasted a couple of minutes;
a mighty roar, indistinct, blended,
hoarse, as of tens of thousands of
men uttering one immense shout. It
was, had it lasted, like the sound of
the sea breaking upon some cavernous
coast.</p>

<p>Upon a look of inquiry and surprise
from the emperor, Sejanus sent the
slave who had brought the carrier-pigeon
to ascertain the cause, and before
the sound had ceased the messenger
returned, and reported that it was
only Germanicus CÃ¦sar riding into
camp. Augustus fixed his eyes on the
ground, and Tiberius looked at Sejanus
and at Cneius Piso.</p>

<p>The emperor, after a second or two
of musing, resumed his way toward
the rustic circus and the camp, attended
by those around.</p>

<p>Paulus felt he had not gained much
by his interview. He now touched
the arm of Sejanus, who was about following
the imperial group, and said,
pointing toward the spot where Benigna
still stood waiting,</p>

<p>"Yonder is Crispina's daughter, who
is here in obedience to your letter."</p>

<p>Sejanus answered this reminder with
a sour and peculiar smile.</p>

<p>"Good," said he; "she has come
to announce the fine news to her betrothed.
Let her tell him that he has
only to break a horse for Tiberius
CÃ¦sar to obtain his freedom. I have
no time to attend any more to slaves
and their mates. She has now but to
ask for Claudius at that palace. He
has orders to expect her, and to receive
from her mouth the pleasing information
I have just given you."</p>

<p>Saying this, he walked away.</p>

<p>Our hero conceived some undefined
misgiving from these words, or rather
from the tone, perhaps, in which
the prefect had uttered them. Unable
to question the speaker, he slowly
returned to poor little Benigna, and
said, "Well, Benigna, I have ascertained
what you have to do; and,
first of all, Claudius expects you within."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he knocked at the
door. This time only one leaf of it
was opened, and a slave, standing in
the aperture, and scanning Paulus and
his companion, demanded their business;
while the sentries on either
hand at the sculptured pillars, or <i>antÃ¦</i>
of the porch, looked and listened superciliously.</p>

<p>"Is the secretary-slave Claudius
here?" asked the youth.</p>

<p>Before the porter could reply, steps
and voices resounded in the hall within,
and the porter sprang out of the
way, flinging almost into Paulus's face
the other leaf of the door, and bowing
low. Three gentlemen, two of whom
apparently were half-drunk, their faces
flushed, and their arms linked together,
appeared staggering upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
threshold, where they stood awhile to
steady themselves before emerging
into the street.</p>

<p>"I tell you, my Pomponius Flaccus,"
said he who was in the middle&mdash;a
portly man, with a good-natured,
shrewd, tipsy look&mdash;"it is all a pretty
contrivance, and there will be no
slaughter, for the beast is to be muzzled."</p>

<p>"And I tell you, my Lucius Piso,"
returned he on the left, a wiry drinker,
"my governor of Rome, my dedicatee
of Horace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not the dedicatee of Horace,"
interrupted the other; "poor
Horace dedicated the art-poetical to
my two sons."</p>

<p>"How could he do that?" broke
in Pomponius. "You see double.
Two sons, indeed! How many sons
have you? tell me that. Again, how
could one man dedicate a single work
to a double person? answer me that.
You know nothing whatever about
poetry, except in so far as it is fiction;
but we don't want fiction in these
matters. We want facts; and it is a
fact&mdash;a solemn fact&mdash;that the slave
will be devoured."</p>

<p>"I hold it to be merely a pleasant
fiction," retorted Piso fiercely.</p>

<p>"Then I appeal to Thrasyllus here,"
rejoined the other. "O thou Babylonian
seer! will not Claudius the
slave be devoured in the circus before
the assembled people?"</p>

<p>At these words our hero looked at
Benigna, and Benigna at him, and she
was astounded.</p>

<p>He who was thus questioned&mdash;a
man of ghastly face, with long, black
hair hanging down to his shoulders,
and sunken, wistful, melancholy eyes&mdash;wore
an Asiatic dress. He was
not intoxicated, and seemed to have
fallen by chance into his present companionship,
from which he appeared
eager to disengage himself.</p>

<p>Gently shaking off the vague hand
of Pomponius Flaccus, he acted as the
oracles did.</p>

<p>"You are certainly right," he said;
but he glanced at Lucius Piso while
speaking, and then stepped quickly
into the street, which he crossed.</p>

<p>Each of the disputants naturally
deemed the point to have been decided
in his own favor.</p>

<p>"You hear?" cried Flaccus; "the
horse is to paw him to death, and then
to devour him alive."</p>

<p>"How can he?" said Piso. "How
can he, after d&mdash;d&mdash;death, devour him
alive? Besides, Thrasyllus declared
that I was right."</p>

<p>"Why," shouted Flaccus, "if we had
not been drinking together all the
morning, I should think you had lost
your senses."</p>

<p>"Not by any means," said Piso;
"and I will prove to you by logic
that Claudius the slave," (again at this
name our hero and poor little Benigna
looked at each other&mdash;she starting
and turning half-round, he merely directing
a glance at her,) "that Claudius
the slave will not and cannot be
devoured by Sejanus&mdash;I mean that
beast Sejanus."</p>

<p>Paulus, chancing to look toward
the two prÃ¦torian sentries, whose general
he supposed to be mentioned,
observed them covertly smiling. More
puzzled than ever, he gave all his attention
to the tipsy dispute which was
raging in the palace doorway.</p>

<p>"Well, prove it then," roared Flaccus,
"with your logic!"</p>

<p>"Have I not a thumb?" resumed
Lucius Piso; "and can I not turn it
down in the nick of time, and so save
the wretch?"</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho!" laughed out the
other; "and what notice will a horse
take of your thumb? Is this horse
such an ass as to mind whether your
thumb be up or down, though you
are governor of Rome?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think," retorted Piso,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
in a tone of concentrated bitterness,
"with your rules of logic, that the
horse is not properly trained to his
manners?"</p>

<p>"Have I not told you," said Flaccus,
"in spite of your rules of thumb,
that the horse is not an ass?"</p>

<p>The rudeness and coarseness of
Pomponius Flaccus had succeeded in
sobering Lucius Piso. He here remained
a moment silent, drew himself
up with dignity to the full height
of his portly person, and at last said,</p>

<p>"Enough! When you have drunk
a little more, you will be able to understand
a plain demonstration. But
whom have we here? Why, it is our
glorious Apicius, whose table no other
table rivals for either abundance or
delicacy. Who is your venerable
friend, Apicius?"</p>

<p>This was addressed to a dyspeptic-looking
youth, magnificently attired,
who, in company with a person in
the extreme decline of life, approached
the door. Paulus and Benigna
stood aside, finding themselves still
constrained to listen while waiting for
room to enter the blocked-up door
of the palace.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," replied Apicius,
"that you forget Vedius Pollio, who,
since you mention my poor table,
has often kindly furnished it with
such lampreys as no other mortal
ever reared?"</p>

<p>The old man, whose age was not
redolent of holiness, but reeking with
the peculiar aroma of a life passed in
boundless and systematic self-indulgence,
leered with running, bloodshot
eyes, and murmured that they
paid him too much honor.</p>

<p>"Sir, you feed your lampreys well,"
said Pomponius Flaccus, "in your
Vesuvian villa. <i>They eat much living,
and they eat well dead.</i>"</p>

<p>"I assure you," said Pollio, "that
nothing but humorous exaggerations
and witty stories have been circulated
upon that subject. I can, with the
strictest accuracy, establish the statement
that no human being ever died
merely and simply in order that my
lampreys should grow fat and luscious.
On the other hand, I do not
deny that if some slave, guilty of great
enormities, had in any event to forfeit
life, the lampreys may in such
cases, perhaps, have availed themselves
of the circumstance. An opportunity
might then arise which they
had neither caused nor contrived."</p>

<p>"The flavor, in other words, never
was the final cause of any slave's
punishment," said Lucius Piso.</p>

<p>"You use words, sir," said Pollio,
"which are correct as to the fact,
and philosophical as to the style."</p>

<p>"Talking of philosophy," said
Apicius, "do you hold with this
young Greek, this Athenian Dion
who has lately visited the court, that
man eats in order to live? or with
me, that he lives in order to eat?"</p>

<p>"Horror of horrors!" murmured
Flaccus, "the Athenian boy is demented."</p>

<p>"Whenever there is any thing to
eat with you, my Apicius," said Lucius
Piso, "unless there be something
to drink with my Pomponius here,
may I be alive to do either the one
or the other."</p>

<p>"Why not do both?" wheezed
Vedius Pollio. "Whither are you
even now going?"</p>

<p>"To the camp for an appetite,"
said Pomponius Flaccus, descending
the steps out of the palace hall into
the street, and reeling against Paulus,
who held him from staggering
next against Benigna.</p>

<p>"What do you two want here?"
he suddenly asked steadying himself.</p>

<p>"I am accompanying," replied
Paulus, "this damsel, who comes
hither by CÃ¦sar's order."</p>

<p>"What CÃ¦sar?" asked Pomponius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tiberius Claudius Nero," returned
Paulus.</p>

<p>He naturally supposed that this
formal-sounding answer would have
struck some awe into the curious
company among whom he had so
unwittingly alighted with his rustic
charge.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Pomponius
Flaccus, "Biberius Caldius Mero, say
you?"</p>

<p>Paulus started in amazement.</p>

<p>"<i>Ebrius</i>, drunk," continued Piso,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex quo</i>&mdash;How does it go on? <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ex
quo</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex quo</i>," resumed Pomponius
solemnly, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">semel factus est</i>."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The astonishment of Paulus and
Benigna knew no bounds. Was it
possible that in the very precincts of
CÃ¦sar's residence for the time, at the
door of an imperial palace, within
hearing of two prÃ¦torian sentries, in
the public street and open daylight,
persons should be found, not reckless
outcasts maddened by desperation,
but a whole company of patricians,
who, correcting each other as they
might do in reciting a popular proverb,
or an admired song, should
speak thus of the man to whom gladiators,
having not an hour to live,
cried, "As we die we salute thee?"
The man at whose name even courageous
innocence trembled?</p>

<p>"I said," repeated Paulus after a
pause, "Tiberius Claudius Nero."</p>

<p>"And I said," replied Pomponius,
"Biberius Caldius Mero."</p>

<p>"Drunk but once," added Lucius
Piso, who had evidently quite recovered
from his own inebriation.</p>

<p>"Since ever he was so first," concluded
Pomponius Flaccus.</p>

<p>A general laugh, in which all present
joined save Paulus and Benigna,
greeted this sally, and, in the midst
of their hilarity an elegant open chariot
of richly-sculptured bronze, the
work being far more costly than the
material, drawn by two handsome
horses, and driven by a vigorous and
expert charioteer, came swiftly down
the street in the contrary direction
of the camp, and stopped opposite
the door.</p>

<p>As the horses were pulled back
upon their haunches, a youth, tall,
well made, and eminently graceful,
sprang to the ground. He had a
countenance in the extraordinary
beauty of which intellect, attempered
by a sweet, grave, and musing expression,
played masterful and luminous.
He was neatly but gravely
dressed, after the Athenian fashion.
The four personages at the door,
who were, by the by, far more floridly
arrayed, and wore various ornaments,
nevertheless looked like bats
among which a bird of paradise had
suddenly alighted. No gayety of
attire could cover the unloveliness of
their minds, lives, and natures, nor
could the plainness of his costume
cause the new-comer to be disregarded
or mistaken anywhere. In the
whole company Lucius Piso alone
was a man of sense, solid attainments,
and spirit, though he was a
hard drinker. Even the others, drivelling
jesters as they were, became
sober now at once; they uncovered
instinctively, and greeted the youth,
as he passed, with an obeisance as
low as that performed by the <i>ostiarius</i>,
who stood ready to admit him.
When, returning these salutes, he
had entered the palace, Piso said, for
the information of Vedius Pollio, who
had come from Pompeii, "<i>That is
he</i>."</p>

<p>"What! the young Athenian philosopher
of whom we have heard so
much?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Dionysius, young as he is,
I am told that he is certain to fill the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
next vacancy in their famous Areopagus."</p>

<p>"He is high in Augustus's good
graces, is he not?" asked Pollio.</p>

<p>"Augustus would swear by him,"
said Flaccus. "It is lucky for all of
us that the youth has no ambition,
and is going away again soon."</p>

<p>"What does Biberius say of him?"
inquired Apicius.</p>

<p>"Say? Why, what does he ever
say of any one, at least of any distinguished
man?"</p>

<p>"Simply not a word."</p>

<p>"Well, think then what does he
think?"</p>

<p>"Not lovingly, I suspect. Their
spirits, their geniuses, would not long
agree. If he was emperor, Dionysius
of Athens would not have so brilliant
a reception at court."</p>

<p>"But is it then really brilliant?
Does one so young sustain his own
part?" asked Pollio.</p>

<p>"You never heard any person like
him; I will answer for that," replied
Lucius Piso. "He is admirable. I
was amazed when I met him. Augustus,
you know, is no dotard, and
Augustus is enchanted with him. The
men of letters, besides, are all raving
about him, from old Titus Livy down
to L. Varius, the twiddler of verses,
the twiddle-de-dee successor of our
immortal Horace and our irreplaceable
Virgil. And then Quintus Haterius,
who has scarcely less learning than
Varro, (and much more worldly knowledge;)
Haterius, who is himself what
erudite persons rarely are, the most
fascinating talker alive, and certainly
the finest public speaker that has addressed
an assembly since the death
of poor Cicero, declares that Dionysius
of Athens&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! enough! enough!" cried
Apicius, interrupting; "you make
me sick with these praises of airy,
intangible nothings. I shan't eat comfortably
to-day. What are all his accomplishments,
I should like to know,
compared to one good dinner?"</p>

<p>"You will have long ceased to eat,"
retorted Piso, "when his name will
yet continue to be pronounced."</p>

<p>"And what good will pronouncing
do, if you are hungry?" said Apicius.</p>

<p>"What has he come to Italy for?"
persisted old Pollio.</p>

<p>"You know," said Piso, "that all
over the east, from immemorial time,
some great, mysterious, and stupendous
being has been expected to appear
on earth about this very date."</p>

<p>"Not only in the east, good Piso,"
said Pollio; "my neighbor in Italy,
you know, the CumÃ¦an sibyl, is construed
now never to have had any
other theme."</p>

<p>"You are right," returned Piso; "I
meant to say that the prevailing notion
has always been that it is in the east
this personage will appear, and then
his sway is to extend gradually into
every part of the world. Old sayings,
various warning oracles, traditions
among common peasants, who cannot
speak each other's languages and
don't even know of each other's existence,
the obscure songs of the sibyls,
the dream of all mankind, the mystical
presentiments of the world concur,
and have long concurred, upon that
singular subject. Moreover, the increasing
corruption of morals, to which
Horace adverts," added Piso, "will
and must end in dissolving society
altogether, unless arrested by the advent
of some such being. That is
manifest. Haterius and others, who
are learned in the Hebrew literature,
tell me that prodigies and portents, so
well authenticated that it is no more
possible to doubt them than it is to
doubt that Julius CÃ¦sar was murdered
in Rome, were performed by men
who, ages ago, much more distinctly
and minutely foretold the coming of
this person at or near the very time
in which we are living; and, accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
that the whole nation of the
Jews (convinced that those who could
perform such things must have enjoyed
more than mortal knowledge and
power) fully expect and firmly believe
that the being predicted by these
workers of portents is now immediately
to appear. Thus, Haterius&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Pomponius Flaccus,
shaking his head, looking on the
ground, and pressing the tip of his forefinger
against his forehead, "<i>that is not
Haterius's</i> argument, or rather, <i>that is
only the half of it</i>."</p>

<p>"I now remember," resumed Lucius
Piso; "you are correct in checking my
version of it. These ancient seers
and wonder-workers had also foretold
several things that were to come to
pass earlier than the advent of the
great being, and these things having
in their respective times all duly occurred,
serve to convince the Jews,
and indeed have also convinced many
philosophic inquirers, of whom Dionysius
is one, studying the prophetical
books in question, and then exploring
the history of the Hebrews, to see
whether subsequent events really correspond
with what had been foretold&mdash;that
seers who could perform the
portents which they performed in their
day, and who besides possessed a
knowledge of future events verified
by the issue, were and must be genuinely
and truly prophets, and that
their predictions deserved belief concerning
this great, mysterious, and
much-needed personage, who is to
appear in the present generation. And
then there is the universal tradition,
there is the universal expectation, to
confirm such reasonings," added Piso.</p>

<p>The astounding character, as well
as the intrinsic importance and interest
of this conversation, its reference
to his half-countryman Dionysius, of
whom he had heard so much, and the
glimpses of society, the hints about
men and things which it afforded him,
had prevented Paulus from asking
these exalted gentlefolk to make room
for him and Benigna to pass, and had
held him, and indeed her also, spell-bound.</p>

<p>"But how all this accounts, most
noble Piso, for the visit of the Athenian
to the court of Augustus, you have
forgotten to say," remarked Pollio.</p>

<p>"He obtained," replied Piso, "the
emperor's permission to study the Sibylline
books."</p>

<p>"What a pity," said Flaccus, "that
the first old books were burnt in the
great fire at Rome."</p>

<p>"Well," resumed Lucius Piso, "he
brought this permission to me, as governor
of Rome, and I went with him
myself to the quindecemviri and the
other proper authorities. Oh! as to
the books, it is the opinion of those
learned in such matters that there is
little or nothing in the old books
which has not been recovered in the
collection obtained by the senate afterward
from CumÃ¦, Greece, Egypt,
Babylon, and all places where either
the sibyls still lived, or their oracles
were preserved."</p>

<p>"But, after all," said Pollio, "are
not these oracles the ravings of enthusiasm,
if not insanity?"</p>

<p>"Cicero, although in general so
sarcastic and disdainful, so incredulous
and so hard to please," answered
Piso, "has settled that question."</p>

<p>"He has, I allow it," added Pomponius
Flaccus, "and settled it most
completely. What a charming passage
that is wherein the incomparable
thinker, matchless writer, and fastidious
critic expresses his reverential
opinion of the Sibylline books, and
demonstrates with triumphant logic
their claims upon the attention of all
rational, all clear-headed and philosophic
inquirers!"</p>

<p>"I am not a rational, or clear-headed,
or philosophic inquirer," broke in
Apicius, "Come, do come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
camp; and do pray at last allow this
foreign-looking young gentleman and
rustic damsel to enter the doorway."</p>

<p>And so they all departed together.</p>

<p>The <i>atriensis</i> had meanwhile summoned
the master of admissions, who
beckoned to Paulus, and he, followed
by Benigna, now entered the hall,
which was flagged with lozenge-formed
marbles of different hues, and supported
by four pillars of porphyry.
The adventurers passed the perpetual
fire in the ancestral or image-room,
and saw the images of the Mamurras,
dark with the smoke of many generations;
they crossed another chamber
hung with pictures, and went half
round the galleried and shady impluvium,
inclosing a kind of internal garden,
where, under the blaze of the
sunlight, from which they were themselves
sheltered, they beheld, like
streams of shaken diamonds, the spray
of the plashing fountains, the statues
in many-tinted marble, and the glowing
colors of a thousand exquisite
flowers. Near the end of one wing
of the colonnaded quadrangle they
arrived at a door, which they were
passing when their guide stopped
them, and as the door flew open to
his knock, he made them a bow and
preceded them through the aperture.</p>

<p>They noticed, as they followed, that
the slave who had opened this door
was chained to a staple. Several
slaves, who scarcely looked up, were
writing in the room which they now
entered.</p>

<p>The master of admissions, glancing
round the chamber, said, addressing
the slaves in general, "Claudius is not
here, I perceive; let some one go for
him, and say that the daughter of
Crispus, of the One Hundredth Milestone,
has been charged to communicate
to him the pleasure of Tiberius
CÃ¦sar touching his immediate manumission;
and that I, the master of admissions
in the Mamurran palace, am
to add a circumstance or two which
will complete the information the damsel
has to give. Let some one, therefore,
fetch Claudius forthwith, and
tell him that he keeps us waiting."</p>

<p>During this speech, which was rather
pompously delivered, Paulus noticed
that, close to a second door in
the chamber at the end opposite to
that where they had entered, a young
slave was seated upon a low settle,
with a hide belt round his waist, to
which was padlocked a light but
strong brass chain, soldered at the
nether link to a staple in the floor.
This slave now rose, and opening the
door, held it ajar till one of the clerks,
after a brief whisper among themselves,
was detached to execute the errand
which the steward had delivered. The
slave closed the door again, the clerks
continued their writing, the steward
half-shut his eyes, and leaned against
a pillar in an attitude of serene if not
sublime expectation; and Paulus and
Benigna waited in silence.</p>

<p>During the pause which ensued,
Paulus beheld the steward suddenly
jump out of his dignified posture, and
felt a hand at the same time laid lightly
on his own shoulder. Turning
round, he saw the youth who had a
few minutes before descended from
the bronze chariot.</p>

<p>"Ought I not to be an acquaintance
of yours?" asked the new-comer
with an agreeable smile. "You are
strikingly like one whom I have
known. He was a valiant Roman
knight, once resident in Greece; I
mean Paulus Lepidus Ãmilius, who
helped, with Mark Antony, to win the
great day of Philippi."</p>

<p>"I am, indeed, his only son," said
Paulus.</p>

<p>"You and a sister, I think," returned
the other, "had been left at home,
in Thrace, with your nurse and the
servants, when some business a little
more than three years ago brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
your father and his wife, the Lady
Aglais, to Athens. There I met them.
Alas! he is gone. I have heard it.
But where are your mother and your
sister?"</p>

<p>Paulus told him.</p>

<p>"Well, I request you to say to
them that Dionysius of Athens&mdash;so
people style me&mdash;remembers them
with affection. I will visit them and
you. Do I intrude if I ask who is
this damsel?" (glancing kindly toward
Benigna, who had listened with visible
interest.)</p>

<p>Paulus told him, in a few rapid
words, not only who she was, but
with distinct details upon what errand
she had come.</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished when
Claudius, the slave, arrived breathless,
in obedience to the summons of the
magister.</p>

<p>"The orders of Tiberius CÃ¦sar to
me," observed this functionary in a
slow, loud voice, but with rather a
shamefaced glance at Dion, "are,
that I should see that you, Claudius,
learnt from this maiden the conditions
upon which he is graciously pleased
to grant you your liberty, and then
that I should myself communicate
something in addition."</p>

<p>"O Claudius!" began Benigna,
blushing scarlet, "we, that is, not
you, but I&mdash;I was not fair, I was not
just to Tib&mdash;that is&mdash;just read this letter
from the illustrious prefect Sejanus
to my father."</p>

<p>Claudius, very pale and biting his
lip, ran his eye in a moment through
the document, and giving it back to
Benigna awaited the communication.</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "only this moment
have I learnt the easy, the trifling
condition which the generous
CÃ¦sar, and tribune of the people, attaches
to his bounty."</p>

<p>There was a meaning smile interchanged
among the slaves, which escaped
none present except Benigna;
and Claudius became yet more pallid.</p>

<p>"The prefect Sejanus has just told
Master Paulus," pursued the young
maiden, "that you have only to break
a horse for Tiberius CÃ¦sar to obtain
forthwith your freedom, and fifty
thousand sesterces too," she added in
a lower voice.</p>

<p>A dead silence ensued, and lasted
for several instants.</p>

<p>Paulus Ãmilius, naturally penetrating
and of a vivid though imperfectly-educated
mind, discerned this
much, that some mystery, some not
insignificant secret, was in the act of
disclosure. The illustrious visitor
from Athens had let the hand which
lay on Paulus's shoulder fall negligently
to his side, and with his head
thrown a little back, and a somewhat
downward-sweeping glance, was
surveying the scene. He possessed
a far higher order of intellect than
the gallant and bright-witted youth
who was standing beside him; and
had received, in the largest measure
that the erudite civilization of classic
antiquity could afford, that finished
mental training which was precisely
what Paulus, however accomplished
in all athletic exercises, rather lacked.
Both the youths easily saw that something
was to come; they both felt
that a secret was on the leap.</p>

<p>"Break a horse!" exclaimed the
slave Claudius, with parched, white
lips; "I am a poor lad who have
always been at the desk! What do
I know of horses or of riding?"</p>

<p>There was an inclination to titter
among the clerks, but it was checked
by their good-nature&mdash;indeed, by
their liking for Claudius; they all
looked up, however.</p>

<p>"Your illustrious master," replied
the magister or steward, or major-domo,
"has thought of this, and, indeed,
of every thing;" again the man
directed the same shamefaced glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
as before toward Dion. "Knowing,
probably, your unexpertness in horses,
which is no secret among your fellow-slaves,
and in truth, among all
your acquaintances, Tiberius CÃ¦sar
has, in the first place, selected for
you the very animal, out of all his
stables, which you are to ride at the
games in the circus before the couple
of hundred thousand people who
will crowd the champaign."</p>

<p>"At the games!" interrupted Claudius,
"and in the circus! Why, all
who know me know that I an arrant
coward."</p>

<p>Like a burst of bells, peal upon
peal, irrepressible, joyous, defiant,
and frank, as if ringing with astonishment
and scorn at the thing, yet also
full of friendliness and honest pitying
love for the person, broke forth the
laugh of Paulus. It was so genuine
and so infectious, that even Dion
smiled in a critical, musing way, while
all the slaves chuckled audibly, and
the slave chained to the staple near
the door rattled his brass fastenings
at his sides. Only three individuals
preserved their gravity, the shamefaced
steward, poor little frightened
Benigna, and the astonished Claudius
himself.</p>

<p>"In the second place," pursued
the magister or steward, "besides
choosing for you the very animal,
the individual and particular horse,
which you are to ride, the CÃ¦sar has
considerately determined and decided,
in view of your deserved popularity
among all your acquaintances,
that, if any acquaintance of yours,
any of your numerous friends, any
other person, in fine, whoever, in
your stead shall volunteer to break
this horse for Tiberius CÃ¦sar, you
shall receive your freedom and the
fifty thousand sesterces the very next
morning, exactly the same."</p>

<p>A rather weak and vague murmur
of applause from the slaves followed
this official statement.</p>

<p>"And so the CÃ¦sar," said Claudius,
"has both selected me the
steed, and has allowed me a substitute
to break him, if I can find any
substitute. Suppose, however, that I
decline such conditions of liberty altogether&mdash;what
then?"</p>

<p>"Then Tiberius CÃ¦sar sells you
to-morrow morning to Vedius Pollio
of Pompeii, who has come hither on
purpose to buy you, and carry you
home to his CumÃ¦an villa."</p>

<p>"To his tank, you mean," replied
poor Claudius, "in order that I may
fatten his lampreys. I am in a pretty
species of predicament. But name
the horse which I am to break at the
games."</p>

<p>Dion turned his head slightly toward
the steward, who was about to
answer, and the steward remained
silent. A sort of excitement shot
through the apartment.</p>

<p>"Name the horse, if you please,
honored magister," said Claudius.
Even now the steward could not, or
did not, speak.</p>

<p>Before the painful pause was broken,
the attention of all present was
arrested by a sudden uproar in the
street. The noise of a furious trampling,
combined with successive shrieks,
whether of pain or terror, was borne
into the palace.</p>

<p>Dionysius, followed by Paulus, by
Claudius, by the steward, and Benigna,
ran to the window, if such it
can be termed, drew aside the silken
curtain, and pushed open the gaudily-painted,
perforated shutter, when
a strange and alarming spectacle was
presented in the open space formed
by cross-streets before the left front
of the mansion.</p>

<p>A magnificent horse of bigger stature,
yet of more elegant proportions,
than the horses which were then used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
for the Roman cavalry, was in the
act of rearing; and within stroke of
his fore-feet, on coming down, lay a
man, face under, motionless, a woollen
tunic ripped open behind at the
shoulder, and disclosing some sort of
wound, from which blood was flowing.
The horse, which was of a
bright roan color, was neither ridden
nor saddled, but girt with a cloth
round the belly, and led, or rather
held back, by two long cavassons,
which a couple of powerfully-built,
swarthy men, dressed like slaves, held
at the further ends on opposite sides
of the beast, considerably apart, and
perhaps thirty feet behind him. One
of these lines or reins&mdash;that nearest
the palace&mdash;was taut, the other was
slack; and the slave who held the
former had rolled it twice or thrice
round his bare arm, and was leaning
back, and hauling, hand over hand.</p>

<p>The animal had apparently stricken
on the back, unawares, with a fore-foot
play and a pawing blow, the
man who was lying so still and motionless
on the pavement, and the
beast, having reared, was now trying
to come down upon his victim. But
no sooner were his fore-legs in the
air than he, of course, thereby yielded
a sudden purchase to the groom who
was pulling him with the taut cavasson,
and this man was thus at last
enabled to drag him fairly off his
hind-legs, and to bring him with a
hollow thump to the ground upon
his side. Before the brute could
again struggle to his feet, four or five
soldiers who happened to be nigh,
running to the rescue, had lifted, and
carried out of harm's way, the prostrate
and wounded man.</p>

<p>"That is the very horse!" exclaimed
the magister, stretching his
neck between the shoulders of Dion
and Paulus, at the small window of
the palace.</p>

<p>"I observe," said Paulus, "that the
cavasson is ringed to a muzzle&mdash;the
beast is indisputably muzzled."</p>

<p>"Why is he muzzled?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied the magister,
"he eats people!"</p>

<p>"Eats people!" echoed Paulus, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"O gods!" cried Benigna.</p>

<p>"Yes," quoth the steward; "the
horse is priceless; he comes of an inestimable
breed; that is the present
representative of the <i>Sejan race of
steeds</i>. Your Tauric horses are cats
in comparison; your cavalry horses
but goats. That animal is directly
descended from the real horse Sejanus,
and excels, they even say, his sire,
and indeed he also in his turn goes
now by the old name. He is the
horse Sejanus."</p>

<p>At these words Paulus could not,
though he tried hard, help casting
one glance toward Benigna, who had
been with him only so short a time
before at the top of the palace, listening
to the conversation of the tipsy
patricians. The poor little girl had
become very white and very scare-faced.</p>

<p>"Tell us more," said Dionysius,
"of this matter, worthy magister.
We have all heard that phrase of ill
omen&mdash;'such and such a person has
the horse Sejanus'&mdash;meaning that he
is unlucky, that he is doomed to destruction.
Now, what is the origin
and what is the true value of this
popular proverb?"</p>

<p>"Like all popular proverbs," replied
the steward, with a bow of the
deepest reverence to the young Athenian
philosopher, "it has some value,
my lord, and a real foundation, although
Tiberius has determined to
confute it by practical proof. You
must know, most illustrious senator
of Athens, that during the civil wars
which preceded the summer-day stillness
of this glorious reign of Augustus,
no one ever appeared in battle-field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
or festive show so splendidly
mounted as the knight Cneius Sejus,
whose name has attached itself to the
race.</p>

<p>"His horse, which was of enormous
proportions, like the beast you
have just beheld, would try to throw
you first and would try to eat you
afterward. Few could ride him:
and then his plan was simple. Those
whom he threw he would beat to
death with his paws, and then tear
them to pieces with his teeth. Moreover,
if he could not dislodge his rider
from the ephippia by honest plunging
and fair play, he would writhe
his neck round like a serpent&mdash;indeed,
the square front, large eyes, and supple
neck remind one of a serpent;
he would twist his head back, I say,
all white and dazzling, with the ears
laid close, the lips drawn away, and
the glitter of his teeth displayed, and,
seizing the knee-cap or the shinbone,
would tear it off, and bring down the
best horseman that ever bestrode a
Bucephalus. What usually followed
was frightful to behold; for, once a
rider was dismounted, the shoulder
has been seen to come away between
the brute's teeth, with knots and tresses
of tendons dripping blood like tendrils,
and the ferocious horse has been
known with his great fat grinders to
crush the skull of the fallen person,
and lap up the brains&mdash;as you would
crack a nut&mdash;after which, he paws
the prostrate figure till it no longer
resembles the form of man. But the
present horse Sejanus, which you
have just beheld, excels all in strength,
beauty, and ferocity; he belongs to
my master Tiberius."</p>

<p>"Ah gods!" exclaimed poor Benigna;
"this is the description of a
demon rather than of a beast."</p>

<p>Dionysius and Paulus exchanged
one significant glance, and the former
said:</p>

<p>"What became of the first possessor,
who yields his name to so unexampled
a breed of horses? what became
of the knight Sejus?"</p>

<p>"A whisper had transpired, illustrious
sir," replied the steward, "that
this unhappy man had fed the brute
upon human flesh. Mark Antony,
who coveted possession of the horse,
brought some accusation, but not this,
against the knight, who was eventually
put to death; but Dolabella, the
former lieutenant of Julius CÃ¦sar, had
just before given a hundred thousand
sesterces (Â£800) to Sejus for the animal;
therefore Antony killed the knight
for nothing, and failed to get Sejanus;
at least he failed that time. Dolabella,
however, did not prosper; he almost
immediately afterward murdered
himself. Cassius thereupon became
the next master of the Sejan horse, and
Cassius rode him at the fatal battle
of Philippi, losing which, Cassius in
his turn, after that resolute fashion of
which we all have heard, put an end
to his own existence."</p>

<p>"To one form of it," observed Dionysius.</p>

<p>"This time," continued the magister,
bowing, "Mark Antony had his
way&mdash;he became at last the lord of
the Sejan horse, but likewise he, in
his turn, was doomed to exemplify
the brute's ominous reputation; for
Antony, as you know, killed himself
a little subsequently at Alexandria.
The horse had four proprietors in a
very short period, and in immediate
succession, the first of whom was cruelly
slain, and the three others slew
themselves. Hence, noble sir, the
proverb."</p>

<p>By this time, the magister had told
his tale, the street outside had become
empty and silent, and the parties
within the chamber had thoroughly
mastered and understood the horrible
truth which underlay the case of the
slave Claudius, and this new instance
of Tiberius's wrath and vengeance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>The magister, Claudius, and Benigna
had returned to the other end of
the room, where the slaves were writing,
and had left Paulus and Dion still
standing thoughtfully near the window.</p>

<p>Claudius exclaimed, "My turn it is
at present; it will be some one else's
soon!"</p>

<p>He and Benigna were now whispering
together. The magister stood a
little apart, looking on the ground in
a deep reverie, his chin buried in the
hollow of his right hand, the arm of
which was folded across his chest.
The slaves were bending over their
work in silence.</p>

<p>Says Paulus in a low voice to Dion,
"You have high credit with the emperor,
illustrious Athenian; and surely
if you were to tell him the whole
case, he would interfere to check the
cruelty of this man, this Tiberius."</p>

<p>"What, Augustus do this for a
slave?" replied Dion mournfully.
"The emperor would not, and by the
laws could not, interfere with Vedius
Pollio, or any private knight, in the
treatment or government of his slaves,
who are deemed to be the absolute
property of their respective lords;
what chance, then, that he should
meddle, or, if he meddled, that he
should successfully meddle, with Tiberius
CÃ¦sar on behalf of an offending
mance? And this too for the
sake, remember, of a low-born girl?
Women are accounted void of deathless
souls, my friend, even by some
who suspect that men may be immortal.
By astuteness, by beauty, not
beauteously employed, and, above all,
by the effect of habit, imperceptible
as a plant in its growth, stealthy as
the prehensile ivy, some few individual
women, like Livia, Tiberius's
mother, and Julia, Augustus's daughter,
have acquired great accidental
power. But to lay down the principle
that the slightest trouble should
be taken for these slaves, would in
this Roman world raise a symphony
of derision as musical as the cry of
the Thessalian hounds when their
game is afoot."</p>

<p>Paulus, buried in thought, stole a
look full of pity toward the further
end of the apartment. "Slaves, women,
laws, gladiators," he muttered,
"and brute power prevalent as a god.
Every day, noble Athenian, I learn
something which fills me with hatred
and scorn for the system amid which
we are living." He then told Dion
the story of Thellus and Alba; he
next laid before him the exact circumstances
of Benigna and Claudius; relating
what had occurred that very
morning, and by no means omitting
the strange and wonder-fraught conversation
at the door of the palace,
after which he added,</p>

<p>"I declare to you solemnly&mdash;but
then I am no more than an uninstructed
youth, having neither your natural
gifts nor your acquired knowledge&mdash;I
never heard any thing more enchanting,
more exalted, more consoling,
and to my poor mind more reasonable,
or more probable, than that some
god is quickly to come down from
heaven and reform and control this
abominable world. Why do I say
probable? Because it would be god-like
to do it. I would ask nothing
better, therefore, than to be allowed
to join you and go with you all over
the world; searching and well weighing
whatever evidences and signs may
be accessible to man's righteously discontented
and justly wrathful industry
in such a task; and I would be in
your company when you explored
and decided whether this sublime
dream, this noble, generous, compensating
hope, this grand and surely divine
tradition, be a truth, or, ah me!
ah me! nothing but a vain poem of
the future&mdash;a beautiful promise never
to be realized, the specious mockery
of some cruel muse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>Dion's blue eyes kindled and burned,
but he remained silent.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, listen further,"
added Paulus. "What would the
divine being who is thus expected,
were he in this room, deem of this
transaction before our eyes? You
have heard the steward's account of
the horse Sejanus; you have heard
Claudius's allusion to Vedius Pollio's
lampreys. Now, you are a wise, witty,
and eloquent person, and you can
correct me if I say wrong&mdash;in what
is the man whom the horse Sejanus,
for instance, throws and tears to pieces
better than the horse? In what is
the man whom the lampreys devour
better than the lampreys? I say the
horse and the lampreys are better than
the man, if mere power be a thing
more to be esteemed and honored
than what is right, and just, and honorable,
and estimable; for the lampreys
and the horse possess the greater
might, most indubitably, in the
cases mentioned. The elephant is
stronger than we, the hound is swifter,
the raven lives much longer. Either
the mere power to do a thing deserves
my esteem more than any other object
or consideration, and therefore
whoever can trample down his fellow-men,
and gratify all his brutal instincts
at the expense of their lives, their safety,
their happiness, their reasonable
free-will, is more estimable than he
who is just, truthful, kind, generous,
and noble&mdash;either, I say, the man who
is strong against his fellows is more
good than he who is good&mdash;and the
words justice, right, gentleness, humanity,
honor, keeping faith in promises,
pity for poor little women who are
oppressed and brutally used, virtue,
and such noises made by my tongue
against my palate, express nothing
which can be understood, nothing in
which any mind can find any meaning&mdash;either,
I again say, the lampreys
and the Sejan horse are more to be
esteemed, and valued, and loved than
my sister and my mother, or it is not
true that the mere power of Tiberius,
combined with the brutish inclination
to do a thing, terminates the question
whether it is right to do it. The moment
I like to do any thing, if I can
do it, is it necessarily right that I
should do it? The moment two persons
have a difference, is it right for
either of them, and equally right for
each of them, to murder the other?
But if it was the intention of this
great being, this god who is expected
to appear immediately among us, that
we should be dependent upon each
other, each doing for the other what
the other cannot do for himself&mdash;and
I am sure of it&mdash;then it will please
him, Dion, if I consider what is helpful
and just and generous. Or am I
wrong? Is virtue a dream? Are contrary
things in the same cases equally
good? Are contrary things in the
same cases equally beautiful?</p>

<p>"Are my brutish instincts or inclinations,
which vary as things vary
round me, my only law? Is each of
us intended by this great being to be
at war with all the rest? to regard
the positive power each of us may
have as our sole restriction? to destroy
and injure all the others by whom
we could be served, if we would for
our parts also serve and help? And
must women, for instance, being the
weaker, be brutally used? Tell me,
Dion, will it please this great being if
I try to render service to my fellow-men,
who must have the same natural
claims to his consideration as I
have? or does he wish me to hurt
them and them to hurt me, according
as we may each have the power? Is
there nothing higher in a man than
his external power of action? Answer&mdash;you
are a philosopher."</p>

<p>The countenance of Dion blazed
for one instant, as if the light of a
passing torch had been shed upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
mirror, and then resumed the less vivid
effulgence of that permanent intellectual
beauty which was its ordinary
characteristic. He replied,</p>

<p>"All the philosophy that ever was
taught or thought could not lead you
to truer conclusions."</p>

<p>"Then," returned Paulus, "come
back with me to the other end of the
room."</p>

<p>"Benigna," said Paulus, "your
kindness to my sister and mother, and
your natural probity, had something,
I think, to do with beginning this
trouble in which you and your intended
find yourselves. As you were not
unmindful of us, it is but right that we
should not be unmindful of you. Tiberius
permits any friend of Claudius
the slave to be a substitute in breaking
the horse Sejanus; and Claudius
is to have his freedom and fifty thousand
sesterces, and to marry you,
whom I see to be a good, honorable-hearted
girl, all the same as if he had
complied with the terms in person.
This was thoughtful and, I suppose,
generous of Tiberius CÃ¦sar."</p>

<p>"Would any of these youths who
hear me," added he turning round,
"like to break the fine-looking steed
at the games, before all the people,
instead of Claudius?"</p>

<p>No one replied.</p>

<p>"It will be a distinguished act,"
persisted he.</p>

<p>Dead silence still.</p>

<p>"Then I will do it myself," he said.
"Magister, make a formal note of the
matter in your tablets; and be so
good as to inform the CÃ¦sar of it, in
order that I, on my side, may learn
place and time."</p>

<p>The magister, with a low bow and
a face expressing the most generous
and boundless astonishment, grasped
his prettily-mounted stylus, and taking
the pengillarin from his girdle drew a
long breath, and requested Paulus to
favor him with his name and address.</p>

<p>"I am," replied he, "the knight
Paulus Lepidus Ãmilius, son of one
of the victors at Philippi, nephew of
the ex-triumvir. I reside at Crispus's
inn, and am at present a promised
prisoner of Velleius Paterculus, the
military tribune."</p>

<p>While the steward wrote in his tablets,
Benigna uttered one or two little
gasps and fairly fainted away.
The slave Claudius saved her from
falling, and he now placed her on a
bench against the wall.</p>

<p>Paulus, intimating that he would
like to return to Crispus's hostelry
before dark, and having learnt, in
reply to a question, that Claudius
could procure from Thellus, the gladiator,
a vehicle for Benigna, and
that he would request Thellus himself
to convey her home, turned to
take leave of Dion.</p>

<p>The Athenian, however, said he
would show him the way out of the
palace. They went silent and thoughtful.
In the impluvium they found
a little crowd surrounding Augustus,
who had returned from his promenade
to the camp, and who was
throwing crumbs of bread among
some pigeons near the central fountain.</p>

<p>Two ladies were of the company,
one of whom, in advanced age, was
evidently the Empress Livia, but for
whose influence and management
Germanicus&mdash;certainly not her ungrateful
son Tiberius&mdash;would have
been the next master of the world.
The other lady, who was past her
prime, had still abundant vestiges of
a beauty which must once have been
very remarkable.</p>

<p>She was painted red and plastered
white, with immense care, to look
some fifteen years younger than she
truly was.</p>

<p>Her countenance betrayed to a
good physiognomist, at first glance,
the horrible life she had led. Paulus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
whose experience was little, and,
although she fastened upon him a
flaming glance, which she intended
to be full both of condescension and
fascination, thought that he had seldom
seen a woman either more repulsive
or more insanely haughty.</p>

<p>It was Julia, the new and abhorred
wife of Tiberius. Not long before,
at the request of Augustus, who was
always planning to dispose of Julia,
Tiberius had given up for her the
only woman he ever loved, Agrippina
Marcella.</p>

<p>Tiberius so loved her, if it deserves
to be termed love, that when, being
thus deserted, she took another husband,
(Asinius Gallus,) he, mad with
jealousy, threw him into a dungeon
and kept him there till he died, as
Suetonius and Tacitus record.</p>

<p>"Ah my Athenian!" said the emperor
to Dionysius, placing a hand
affectionately on the youth's shoulder,
"could you satisfy me that those
splendid theories of yours are more
than dreams and fancies; that really
there is one eternal, all-wise, and
omnipotent spirit, who made this universal
frame of things, and governs
it as an absolute monarch; that he
made us; that in us he made a spirit,
a soul, a ghost, a thinking principle,
which will never die; and that
I, who am going down to the tomb,
am only to change my mode of existence;
that I shall not wholly descend
thither; that an urn will not
contain every thing which will remain
of me; and all this in a very different
sense from that which poor Horace
meant. But why speak of it?
Has not Plato failed?"</p>

<p>"Plato," replied Dionysius, "neither
quite failed nor is quite understood,
illustrious emperor. But you
were saying, if I could satisfy you.
Be pleased to finish. Grant I could
satisfy you; what then?"</p>

<p>"Satisfy me that one eternal sovereign
of the universe lives, and that
what now thinks in me," returned
the emperor, while the courtly group
made a circle, "will never cease to
think; that what is now conscious
within me will be conscious for ever;
that now, in more than a mere poetical
allusion to my fame&mdash;and on the
word of Augustus CÃ¦sar, there is no
reasonable request within the entire
reach and compass of my power
which I will refuse you."</p>

<p>"And what sort of a hearing, emperor,"
inquired Dion, "and under
what circumstances, and upon what
conditions, will you be pleased to
give me? and when? and where?"</p>

<p>"In this palace, before the games
end," replied Augustus. "The hearing
shall form an evening's entertainment
for our whole circle and attendance.
You shall sustain your doctrines,
while our celebrated advocates
and orators, Antistius Labio and Domitius
Afer, who disagree with them,
I know, shall oppose you. Let me
see. The CÃ¦sars, Tiberius and Germanicus,
with their ladies, and our host
Mamurra and his family, and all our
circle, shall be present. Titus Livy,
Lucius Varius, Velleius Paterculus,
and the greatest orator Rome ever produced,
except Cicero" (the old man
'mentioned with watery eyes the incomparable
genius to whose murder
he had consented in his youth)&mdash;"I
mean Quintus Haterius&mdash;shall form
a judicial jury. Haterius shall pronounce
the sentence. Dare you face
such an ordeal?"</p>

<p>"I will accept it," replied the
Athenian, blushing; "I will accept
the ordeal with fear. Daring is
contrasted with trembling; but, although
my daring trembles, yet my
trepidation dares."</p>

<p>"Oh! how enchanting!" cried the
august Julia; "we shall hear the eloquent
Athenian." And she clasped
her hands and sent an unutterable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
glance toward Dion, who saw it
not.</p>

<p>"It will be very interesting indeed,"
added the aged empress.</p>

<p>"Better for once than even the
mighty comedy of the palace," said
Lucius Varius.</p>

<p>"Better than the gladiators," added
Velleius Paterculus.</p>

<p>"An idea worthy of the time of
Virgil and MÃ¦cenas," said Titus Livy.</p>

<p>"Worthy of Augustus's time," subjoined
Tiberius, who was leaning
against one of the pillars which supported
the gallery of the impluvium.</p>

<p>"Worthy of his dotage," muttered
Cneius Piso to Tiberius, with a scowl.</p>

<p>"Worthy," said a handsome man,
with wavy, crisp, brown locks, in the
early prime of life, whose military
tunic was crossed with the broad purple
stripe, "worthy of Athens in the
days of Plato; and as Demosthenes
addressed the people after listening
to the reporter of Socrates, so Haterius
shall tell this company what he
thinks, after listening to Dion."</p>

<p>"Haterius is getting old," said Haterius.</p>

<p>"You may live," said Augustus,
"to be a hundred, but you will never
be old; just as our Cneius Piso here
never was young."</p>

<p>There was a laugh. The Haterius
in question was he to whom Ben
Jonson compared Shakespeare as a
talker, and of whom, then past eighty,
Augustus used, Seneca tells us, to
say that his careering thoughts resembled
a chariot whose rapidity
threatened to set its own wheels on
fire, and that he required to be held
by a drag&mdash;"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sufflaminandus</i>."</p>

<p>Dion now bowed and was moving
away, followed modestly by Paulus,
who desired to draw no attention
to himself, when the steward, or <i>magister</i>,
glided quickly up the colonnade
of the impluvium to the pillar
against which Tiberius was leaning,
whispered something, handed his tablets
to the CÃ¦sar, and, in answer to a
glance of surprised inquiry, looked toward
and indicated Paulus.</p>

<p>Tiberius immediately passed Paulus
and Dion, saying in an under tone,
"Follow me," and led the way into
a small empty chamber, of which,
when the two youths had entered it,
he closed the door.</p>

<p>"You are going to break the horse
called Sejanus?" said he, turning
round and standing.</p>

<p>Paulus assented.</p>

<p>"Then you must do so on the fourth
day from this, in the review-ground
of the camp, an hour before sunset."</p>

<p>Paulus bowed.</p>

<p>"Have you any thing to inquire,
to request, or to observe?" pursued
Tiberius.</p>

<p>"Am I to ride the horse muzzled,
sir?" asked the youth.</p>

<p>"The muzzle will be snatched off
by a contrivance of the cavasson,
after you mount him," replied Tiberius,
looking steadfastly at the other.</p>

<p>"Then, instead of a whip, may I
carry any instrument I please in my
hands?" demanded Paulus; "my
sword, for example?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Tiberius; "but
you must not injure the horse; he is
of matchless price."</p>

<p>"But" persisted Paulus, "your justice,
illustrious CÃ¦sar, will make a
distinction between any injury which
the steed may do to himself and any
which I may do to him. For instance,
he might dash himself against some
obstruction, or into the river Liris,
and in trying to clamber out again
might be harmed. Such injuries
would be inflicted by himself, not by
me. The hurt I shall do him either
by spear, or by sword, or by any other
instrument, will not be intended to
touch his life or his health, nor likely
to do so. If I do make any scars, I
<em>think</em> the hair will grow again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>"He will not be so scrupulous on
his side," said Tiberius; "however,
your distinction is reasonable. Have
you any thing else to ask?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I have," said Paulus;
"it is that no one shall give him any
food or drink, except what I myself
shall bring, for twenty-four hours before
I ride him."</p>

<p>Tiberius uttered a disagreeable
laugh.</p>

<p>"Am I to let you starve Sejanus?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"That is not my meaning, sir," answered
Paulus quietly. "I will give
him as much corn and water as he
will take. I wish to prevent him
from having any other kind of provender.
There are articles which
will make a horse drunk or mad."</p>

<p>"I agree," replied Tiberius, "that
he shall have only corn and water,
provided he have as much of both as
my own servant wishes; nor have I
any objection that the servant should
receive these articles from you alone,
or from your groom."</p>

<p>Paulus inclined his head and kept
silence.</p>

<p>"Nothing more to stipulate, I perceive,"
observed Tiberius.</p>

<p>The youth admitted that he had
not; and, seeing the CÃ¦sar move, he
opened the door, held it open while
the great man passed through, and
then taking a friendly leave of Dion,
hastily quitted the palace.</p>

<p>Tiberius, meeting Sejanus, took
him aside and said,</p>

<p>"We have got rid of the brother!
You must have every thing ready to
convey her to Rome the fifth day
from this. And now, enough of private
matters. I am sick of them.
The affairs of the empire await me!"</p>

<h2>THE ANCIENT IRISH CHURCHES.</h2>

<p class="center">BY W. MAZIERE BRADY, D.D.</p>


<p>It was proposed, in the first draught
of Mr. Gladstone's bill for the disestablishment
of the Irish Church, to
erect some of the cathedrals into national
monuments, and to set apart
toward the cost of their future repair
a portion of the fund derived from
the sale of church temporalities.
This clause, however, was set aside;
but even if it had been retained, it
would not have given satisfaction. If
it be the sincere desire of Mr. Gladstone
to do justice to Catholic Ireland,
and to conciliate her people, but one
course remains open to him in regard
to the ancient shrines of Catholic worship,
namely, to restore them to their
original owners. Many of these cathedrals
and churches are altogether unsuited
to the requirements of Protestant
religious service. Some of them
are too large to be maintained by the
tiny congregations which occasionally
visit them. Others require a costly
annual outlay too great to be undertaken
at the expense of the few families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
in whose neighborhood they lie.
Would it not, then, manifestly tend to
the benefit alike of Catholics and Protestants,
that the latter, on terms advantageous
to themselves, should yield
to the former the possession of those
buildings which Protestants do not require
for <i>bona-fide</i> ends, but which
possess, in the eyes of Catholics, a peculiarly
sacred, and, at the same time,
a perfectly legitimate value?</p>

<p>Some ancient Catholic temple is perhaps
situated in a district inhabited by
twenty or thirty Protestants, and five
thousand or ten thousand Catholics.
The Protestants cannot fill a corner of
the spacious fabric. They attach no
value to it as the shrine of a venerated
saint. Its very capabilities for an ornate
and splendid Catholic ritual render
it only the less fit for the simple
requirements of Protestant worship.
Protestants can gain nothing by retaining
such a temple, save the privilege
of keeping it as a trophy of a bygone
and ill-omened ascendency. But
if the British Parliament were to ordain
that such temples should be purchased
from Protestants, who scarcely
require them, and given to Catholics
to supply their evident wants, then a
visible proof would at once be afforded
to the Irish nation that disestablishment
was no coldly conceived or
niggardly administered instalment of
justice, but a ready instrument for cordial
reconciliation of creeds and nationalities.</p>

<p>It is ridiculous to urge as an objection,
that Protestants in general
attach a value, other than a pecuniary
or political one, to the sites of
the shrines of ancient Irish saints.
Few Protestants have any veneration
for St. Patrick, St. Brigid, or St. Nicholas.
Not one Protestant in a thousand
has so much as even heard of
the names of St. Elbe, St. Aidan, St.
Colman, or St. Molana. Irish Protestant
bishops often deny the sacredness
of holy places, and, when consecrating
a site for the erection of a
church, take the opportunity to explain
such consecration to be a mere
form of law. Some Protestant bishops
entertained objections to the selection
of any titles for churches, save those
of Christ and his apostles. They
thought it allowable to celebrate divine
service in a building called Christ
church, or St. Peter's, or St. John's, but
conceived it to be scarcely tolerable
and semi-popish to dedicate an edifice
for worship under the invocation
of St. George, St. Patrick, or St. Michael.
In some dioceses in Ireland,
during the last century, the consecration
of Protestant churches was on
several occasions designedly omitted
in deference to such scruples of conscience.
But the very names of the
ancient Irish saints are precious household
words with Catholics, who dearly
prize the holy shrine, the sacred well,
the hallowed ruins consecrated by the
lingering memories of the virgins,
confessors, and martyrs whose lives
were devoted to the conversion of
Ireland. The Catholic peasant, as he
sorrowfully gazes upon the desecrated
remains of some fallen abbey, or upon
the mouldering walls of a roofless
oratory, often breathes a hopeless
prayer that an unexpected turn of
fortune would once again fill with
robed monks the arched and pillared
cloisters, and replace the solemn solitary
hermit in his peaceful cell. The
reconsecration of their sacred shrines
and temples, long defaced and profaned
by neglect, would realize one
of the fondest dreams of Irishmen.
Why do not British statesmen utilize,
for the general benefit of their
country, the pious sentiments which,
in a religious point of view, they as
Protestants may fail to appreciate, but
which, in a political aspect, it seems
a criminal blindness to disregard?
The legislators who freely vote imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
funds to provide Catholic priests
and altars for Catholic soldiers, sailors,
convicts, and paupers, cannot
possibly entertain religious scruples
against applying a portion of the ancient
Catholic endowments of Ireland
towards the purpose of restoring to
their original uses some of the sites
and shrines whose traditions are still
potent enough in Ireland to sway the
national sympathies.</p>

<p>No injury can result to Protestantism
from the adoption of a course which
would not merely increase the pecuniary
resources of their church, but
also tend materially to promote peace
and good-will between men of different
creeds. There are many ancient
churches in Ireland which could be
specified as almost useless to Protestants,
but yet most precious and valuable
if placed in the hands of Catholics.
Many of the old Irish cathedrals are
entirely, and some are almost entirely
deserted. Ardagh, founded by St. Patrick,
was reckoned among "the most
ancient cathedrals of Ireland." Its first
bishop&mdash;St. Mell&mdash;was buried "in his
own church of Ardagh," wherein
worship a few Protestants who care
but little either for St. Mell or St.
Patrick. The entire Protestant population
of Ardagh parish is less than
one hundred and fifty, while the Catholics
number nearly two and a half
thousands. There is but a scanty
congregation of Protestants at Lismore,
where St. Carthage, or at Leighlin,
where St. Laserian was interred.
At Howth, near Dublin, are the ruins&mdash;still
capable of restoration&mdash;of a
beautiful abbey and college. The
college is occupied by poor tenants.
The abbey is roofless, standing in a
graveyard, choked with weeds and
filth, of which the Protestant incumbent
of the parish is custodian. St.
Canice&mdash;the patron saint of Kilkenny&mdash;was
buried, toward the end of
the sixth century, at Aghadoe. "Aghadoe"&mdash;so
wrote the Rev. M. Kelly,
Professor of Ecclesiastical History in
Maynooth, in his <cite>Calendar of Irish
Saints</cite>&mdash;"at present is a ruin, its walls
nearly perfect, but, like too many similar
edifices in Ireland, all profaned
by sickening desecration. Around it
still bloom in perennial verdure its
far-famed pastures, in a plain naturally
rich, and improved by the monastic
culture of a thousand years. The
buildings are now used as ox-pens
which were once the favorite home
of the pilgrim and stranger." There
are a score of other ruined temples
like Aghadoe, which in their present
condition are a disgrace to civilization;
and yet are possessed of traditions
which render them sacred in
the eyes of Catholics, who would
gladly rescue them from further decay
and restore them to their ancient use.</p>

<p>Every tourist in Connemara has
doubtless visited the famous collegiate
church of St. Nicholas, in Galway. It
is a vast temple, capable of containing
six or seven thousand worshippers.
Its size, the style of its architecture,
and its historical traditions combine
to render it eminently suitable to be
the cathedral church of the Catholic
population of Galway. It anciently
was, not precisely a cathedral, but
the church of the Catholic warden&mdash;a
dignitary who possessed episcopal
jurisdiction, being only subject to the
visitation of the Archbishop of Tuam.
It is now the church of the Protestant
warden, or minister, who performs
divine service, according to the Anglican
ritual, in a portion of the transept,
for the benefit of those members of
the Anglican Church who inhabit the
immediate neighborhood. There is
now no Protestant bishop resident in
Galway, nor has any such functionary
since the era of the Reformation made
Galway his headquarters. So that
this once splendid building is absolutely
thrown away upon Protestants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
being above ten times too large for
a parochial church, and being utterly
useless to them for a cathedral. The
fabric of this grand relic from Catholicity
has been allowed to fall into
decay to such an extent that about
five thousand pounds are now required
to restore it or put it into permanent
repair. It is unlikely that the
Protestants of Galway will contribute
this sum, or take steps to prevent this
noble national monument from sinking,
at no distant period, into hopeless
ruin. The population of the entire
county of Galway consisted, in 1861,
of 261,951 Catholics and 8202 Anglicans,
only a few hundred of the latter
being residents in the town of Galway
and its suburbs. The Catholic
wardenship was changed into a bishopric
by Pope Gregory XVI., in 1830,
when Dr. French, who was then Bishop
of Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora, and
also Warden of Galway, retired to this
diocese. In the same year, Dr. Browne
who was subsequently translated to
Elphin, became the first Bishop of Galway.
Neither Bishop Browne, nor
his successor Bishop O'Donnell, nor
Dr. McEvilly, who became Bishop
of Galway in 1857, were able to provide
a suitable cathedral for the Galway
Catholics. The present pro-cathedral
affords accommodation to
about four thousand persons, and upon
the occasion of missions is thronged to
a dangerous excess. The Catholics of
Galway would gladly avail themselves
of any opportunity which would render
it possible for them to obtain St.
Nicholas, the church of their forefathers,
for a cathedral. The restoration
to Catholic purposes of that edifice,
which is a world too wide for
Protestant wants, would confer a singular
benefit upon an immense number
of Catholics, without inflicting the
least injury upon Protestants. The
present Anglican Warden of Galway
is not young enough to enable him,
by means of commutation under Mr.
Gladstone's bill to do much toward
providing an endowment for his successors.
The payment of a few thousand
pounds, out of the funds of the
Commissioners of Church Temporalities,
to the Galway Protestants, in
compensation for the loss of a fabric
which they find too large for use and
too costly to repair, would enable
them not only to obtain a more convenient
place of worship than the corner
of the spacious transept they now
occupy, but also would help them to
provide the nucleus of a local endowment
for Protestant ministrations after
the decease of the present warden.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of "the city of the
tribes" entertain no higher veneration
for the church of St. Nicholas than
is felt by the men of Munster for the
celebrated Rock of Cashel of the
Kings. In ancient years the "Rock"
was a natural fortress, standing high
over the surrounding plain, and proudly
overlooking the thronged city
which lay beneath its shelter. Upon
the elevated plateau which crowns
the submit of the "Rock," now stand
the ruins of the former cathedral, and
other ecclesiastical buildings, including
the famous chapel of King Cormac,
all of which, to the infinite discredit
of England, have long since been deliberately
abandoned to decay. The
Protestants of Cashel ceased, somewhat
more than a century ago, to occupy
the old Catholic cathedral as a
place of worship. Their archbishop,
an Englishman named Price, disliked
the fatigue of ascending the gradual
incline which leads to the "Rock,"
and removed his throne to the present
cathedral, a barn-like edifice which
stands on the level ground near to the
episcopal palace. In 1838, Dr. Laurence,
the last Protestant Archbishop
of Cashel, died, and the see being reduced
to a bishopric in union with
three other dioceses, the Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
bishop selected for his residence the
city of Waterford in preference to
Cashel. The beautiful cathedral, left
roofless by Archbishop Price, and exposed
since his time to the ravages of
more than a hundred winters, is nevertheless
still capable of restoration.
The fabric, and the site whereon the
cathedral and the other ruins stand,
are at present vested partly in the
Protestant dean and chapter, and
partly in the Vicars Choral of Cashel.
Upon the death of these officials, their
rights will revert to the Commissioners
of Church Temporalities. But these
disestablished functionaries may perhaps
find it to their personal advantage,
as well as to that of their church,
to make an earlier surrender of their
territorial privileges. Whenever the
Commissioners of Temporalities shall
have become the owners of the Rock
of Cashel, they will have to consider
what they will do with it. They may
determine to sell it, or else may transfer
it as a burial-ground to the local
poor-law guardians. Either alternative
will be in the highest degree discreditable
to British legislation. There
is something atrocious in the idea of
offering by public sale the temple
whose almost every stone was marked
by the pious workmen with the mystic
tokens of their craft, and upon whose
decoration kings were wont to lavish
their choicest treasures to make it worthier
for the worship of the Most High.
It will be sacrilegious to submit to auction
the soil wherein lies the mouldering
dust of countless priests and prelates,
chieftains and princes. On the
other hand, it will be miserable and
pitiable in the extreme to consign what
may be termed the <i>Terra Sancta</i> of
ancient Ireland to the care of a pauper
burial board. The zeal of rural
guardians guided economically by the
country squire, or his bailiff, would
be worse even than the scornful vandalism
of Archbishop Price. If the
dead themselves could speak or feel,
they would doubtless shudder in their
tombs at the ring of the salesman's
hammer, and protest with equal horror
against the indignity of including the
repair of their graves amongst the
items of the county poor-rate. They
would accept, in preference to such
degradation, the rude guardianship
of the elements. Nature, even when
she destroys, is reverent, flinging a
green pall of ivy around the tower
which her disintegrating arms encircle,
and spreading a rich carpet of moss
over the dust of those whom she
draws with the embrace of death to
her bosom. The winds and waves,
the floods and storms, may bring a
more rapid dissolution upon deserted
monuments of heroes, but at least
they inflict no dishonor.</p>

<p>But why should the British Parliament
suffer the national memorials of
Ireland to perish without an effort to
preserve them? It can be no gratification
to the vanity of Great Britain
thus to perpetuate, so long as a trace
of the ruined temple or broken altar
may be spared, the tokens of a policy
able, indeed, to insult and to hinder,
but powerless to supplant or destroy
the faith of the Irish people. It cannot,
alas! be denied that England
seized by force upon that Catholic
church of Cashel, banished its priests,
and employed, for three centuries, its
revenues to teach a hostile religion.
That policy has been reversed. It
would be a mode, no less honorable
than wise, of confessing the folly and
guilt of such a policy, were England
to give back the ruins which have
survived it, and allow the Catholic
archbishop and clergy to restore and
reconsecrate their ancient cathedral
and celebrate again Catholic worship
upon the Rock of Cashel.</p>

<p>Let us turn from Galway and
Cashel to the metropolis of Ireland. It
was felt, so far back as the reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
Elizabeth, that two Protestant cathedrals
were too many for Dublin.
"Here be in this little city"&mdash;so wrote
the lord-deputy to Walsingham in
1584&mdash;"two great cathedral churches,
richly endowed, and too near together
for any good they do; the one of
them, dedicated to St. Patrick, had in
more superstitious reputation than the
other, dedicated to the name of Christ,
and for that respect only, though there
were none other, fitter to be suppressed
than continued."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> And a few
months later, the same chief governor
of Ireland again reminded the queen's
secretary of state of the uselessness of
retaining St. Patrick's as a cathedral.
"We have beside it," remarked Perrott,
"in the heart of this city, Christ
church, which is a sufficient cathedral,
so as St. Patrick's is superfluous, except
it be to maintain a few bad singers
to satisfy the covetous humors of
some, as much or more devoted to
St. Patrick's name than to Christ's."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
The rabid Puritanism of Lord-Deputy
Perrott, who hoped that "Christ would
devour St. Patrick and a number of his
devoted followers too,"<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> was not utterly
devoid of truth and common sense.
The maintenance of the cathedral of
St. Patrick has rather proved a hinderance
than a benefit to Protestants. Its
revenues have not been sufficient to
keep up a separate choir of singers;
for most of the St. Patrick's choirmen
belong also to Christ church, and their
efficiency is impaired by being divided
between two cathedrals. But whatever
may be the value of St. Patrick's
as a place for the performance of
church music, its inutility as a place
for Protestant worship is notorious.
Its situation is remote from the fashionable
quarter of Dublin and from
those streets which Protestants inhabit.
Many Protestants flock to St.
Patrick's to hear the choral music, or,
as they sometimes profanely term it,
"Paddy's Opera;" but very few, if
any, attend that cathedral for the
purposes of prayer or worship. In
fact, St. Patrick's, in 1870, is what it
was three hundred years ago, not
only a superfluous cathedral, but one
whose atmosphere is unsuited to the
genius of Protestantism. There is no
place in the Anglican ritual for the
apostle of Ireland. His memory is
not an object of religious veneration;
nor was any day set apart for his
honor by the compilers of the Protestant
liturgy. His name, like that of
any other saint, acts as a repellant,
not as a stimulant, upon the devotion
of Protestants. Sir Benjamin Guinness,
who rescued from ruin the fabric
of St. Patrick's, preferred to say his
prayers and hear sermons elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now that disestablishment has come
upon the Protestant church, the evil
of having two cathedrals in Dublin
appears greater than ever. How,
possibly, can funds be provided by
Protestants to maintain both churches,
Christ church and St. Patrick's? The
latter had nearly fallen to decay but
for the munificence of an individual.
The former is now in want of substantial
repairs, absolutely necessary to preserve
it from ruin. Yet it is clearly
the pecuniary interest of Protestants
to give up St. Patrick's rather than
Christ church, because the money
value of Christ church, such is its present
condition, is insignificant; while
that of St. Patrick's is considerable
enough to defray the charge of restoring
Christ church, and to leave over
and above a wide margin of surplus,
which the church body may employ
as a Protestant endowment fund. The
sum expended by the late Sir Benjamin
Guinness on St. Patrick's is said
to have been Â£100,000; and, according
to a recently printed estimate of
Mr. Street, a London architect of eminence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
the sum of Â£8000 will be sufficient
to rebuild one of the side aisles
of Christ church, and put the rest of
the building into a condition of permanent
repair.</p>

<p>But there are other and more
important considerations which make
Christ church the more desirable
cathedral for Protestants to retain.
It is the old Chapel Royal of Dublin,
the place where the deputies and
chief governors were formerly sworn
into office, and where the state sermons
were preached before the
lords and commons of the Irish parliament.
The lord-lieutenant's pew
is at present frequently attended by
members of the viceregal staff and
other government officials. The situation
of Christ church in the immediate
vicinity of the castle renders it
suitable to be preserved as the state
church in Dublin for the accommodation
of royal visitors and Protestant
viceroys. Christ church, moreover,
is beyond question the chief cathedral
of the Protestant archbishop and clergy
of Dublin. The members of its
chapter are few in number, consisting
of a dean, archdeacon, treasurer, chancellor,
and three prebendaries. The
Protestant church body, if it determines
upon supporting cathedral functionaries
at all in Dublin, may find it
practicable to do so with efficiency
and some show of dignity in Christ
church, without breaking up, or materially
altering, the present constitution
of the chapter. It is likely, moreover,
that the Duke of Leinster, the
head of the Protestant nobility of Ireland,
who will receive a considerable
sum of money under the church act,
in compensation for the loss of his
church patronage, will be glad to
contribute toward the support of
Christ church as the Protestant cathedral,
especially as it is the ancient
burial place of many of his ancestors,
so famous in Irish annals under their
historical title of Earls of Kildare.</p>

<p>To Catholics the gift of St. Patrick's
would be precious, as the restoration
to them of a cathedral which from its
traditions has surpassing claims to
their veneration. Their present pro-cathedral
is regarded only as a temporary
one, and possesses no historical
memories to stir the feelings of its
congregation. The constitution of
the Catholic diocese of Dublin follows
the model of St. Patrick's as far as
regards the number and titles of
the prebendaries; and little, if any,
change would be necessary to render
that cathedral fully answerable to the
requirements of Catholic worship.
And very glorious, truly, are the memories
and traditions which cluster
around the spot whereon St. Patrick
himself erected a church, and hallowed
it by his name. Near it was the
fountain in whose waters the apostle
baptized Alphin, the heathen king of
Dublin. Usher, the learned Protestant
antiquary and divine, tells us that he
had seen this fountain; that it stood
near the steeple; and that, a little before
the year 1639, it was shut up and
inclosed within a private house. The
temple, built by Archbishop Comyn,
on the site of the ancient church of
Patrick, was styled by Sir James Ware
"the noblest cathedral in the kingdom."
It was dedicated to God, the
Blessed Virgin Mary, and St. Patrick.
It was the burial-place of many Catholic
prelates. In it were interred Fulk
de Saunford and his brother John, and
Alexander de Bicknor. Richard Talbot,
brother to the famous earl, had
his last resting-place before the high
altar. Near the altar of St. Stephen
lay Michael Tregury. Three other
Catholic archbishops, namely, Walter
Fitzsimons, William Rokeby, and
Hugh Inge, were entombed in St. Patrick's
in the early part of the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
century&mdash;the last-named prelate dying
in the year 1528. When the Reformation
came, and when Henry
VIII. attempted to force it upon Ireland
against the will of the hierarchy
and people, the cathedral of St. Patrick
became exposed to the hostilities
of the English despot and of
Archbishop Browne, his agent. The
new doctrines were urged in vain by
that prelate, who is described by
Ware as "the first of the clergy who
embraced the Reformation in Ireland."
The king's commission was
as little respected as the homilies of
Archbishop Browne, who advised the
calling of a parliament to pass the
supremacy by act, and wrote to Lord
Cromwell, in 1638, complaining that
"<i>the reliques and images of both his cathedrals
took the common people from
the true worship, and desiring a more
explicit order for their removal</i>," and
for the aid of the lord-deputy's troops
in carrying out his unpopular designs.
The clergy of St. Patrick's made so
vigorous a stand against the reforming
archbishop, that many of them
were deprived of their preferments,
and the cathedral itself was suppressed
for nearly eight years, during Browne's
incumbency. On Queen Mary's accession,
St. Patrick's again resumed its
Catholic splendor and dignity, but
only to lose them once more when her
successor, Elizabeth, thought it necessary
for the security of her throne to
remove utterly, if possible, the Catholic
faith from her dominions. Thus
the fortunes of St. Patrick's cathedral
were, in a measure, identified with
those of the Catholic religion in Ireland.</p>

<p>"The name of no apostle or
evangelist," as was well remarked
by Dr. Manning, the Archbishop of
Westminster, in his sermon at Rome
on the anniversary of St. Patrick,
"carries with it a wider influence
than that of the Apostle of Ireland,
if we except only St. Peter, the prince
of the apostles. No apostle or saint&mdash;Peter
excepted&mdash;has so many millions
of spiritual followers as Patrick.
The Catholic hierarchy in England
owes its origin to Patrick, through the
Irish immigrants into Liverpool, Bristol,
Birmingham, London, and other
great manufacturing and commercial
cities. The vast Catholic hierarchies
in America, Australia, New Zealand,
and other colonies of Great Britain,
trace, in like manner, their spiritual
lineage to Ireland and St. Patrick.
Within the hall of the great Council
of the Vatican St. Patrick counts
more bishops for his children than
any other saint, save Peter; for the
prelates deriving their faith from Ireland
are more numerous than those
of any other nationality. And no
apostle (Peter always excepted) has
his anniversary celebrated in so many
countries and with such demonstrations
of joy as Patrick." Such indeed
is the magic power, if the expression
be permitted, which the very
name of St. Patrick exercises over
Irish Catholics in all parts of the
world, that the restoration of St. Patrick's
cathedral would be regarded by
them as something far greater than the
mere donation of a cathedral to the
Dublin diocese. It would be received
as a convincing sign that the demon
of envenomed distrust has been exorcised,
and that thenceforth English
Protestants, as they have already long
ceased to persecute Irish Catholicism
by penal laws, would likewise abandon
the indirect mode of persecution
which consists in suspicion, falsification,
and slander, in withholding cordiality,
and in retaining, after the dog-in-the-manger
fashion, what is useless
to Protestants, for no apparent reason
but to manifest a dislike to Catholics.
It is with nations as with families or
individuals. Two families, formerly
at enmity and but lately reconciled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
can hardly be said to enjoy a solid or
thorough friendship so long as one
of them causelessly keeps back the
family pictures or sacred heirlooms of
the other. France and England
never could have entertained mutual
sentiments of respect, if England had
been so foolish or so malicious as to
keep in St. Helena the body of Napoleon.
The heirlooms whose restoration
would have the happiest effect
in bringing about amity between
the English and Irish nations, are the
ancient sacred places of Ireland.</p>

<h2>PHASES OF ENGLISH PROTESTANTISM.</h2>


<p>A man with the peculiar turn of
Dr. Temple<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> for finding results of
the past in the present, might perhaps
be inclined to trace the time-honored
cry of the English Protestants, "No
popery!" to the temper of Henry
VIII., who retained the whole of
the Catholic doctrine in his creed
except the supremacy of the pope.
A Catholic will with good reason
see in it a testimony from enemies
to the unity of the church through
the successor of St. Peter. The
historian will point to the fact that
Protestants have from the beginning
agreed only in one thing, hostility
to the church. The <i>Protest</i> of
1529, from which they take their
name, is the first example we have in
history of a thing with which modern
times are familiar&mdash;an arrangement
on the part of those who, as the
phrase goes, "agree in essentials," to
act together for a time in order to accomplish
some common end. In a
similar way we saw Dr. Pusey take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>part in 1865 with the liberals, in order
to promote the election of Mr. Gladstone
as member for the University
of Oxford. He afterward coquetted
unsuccessfully with the Methodists.
And last year he offered to join with
the evangelicals in a protest against
the elevation of Dr. Temple to the
see of Exeter. Yet whatever may
have been the case in times past, we
should have supposed that the futility
of such coalitions in these days had
been long sufficiently evident. Dr.
Pusey, we imagine, now feels little
pleasure at having Mr. Gladstone at
the head of affairs; and if the evangelicals
had accepted his offer instead
of rejecting it, he would have found
out in the end that he had paid much
for their help, and got very little by
it.</p>

<p>By looking back to the circumstances
in which Protestantism began,
we find an explanation of its marked
features&mdash;the variety of its differences,
the fact that these find some common
ground in the cry, "No popery!" and
the inevitably logical tendency of
Protestantism to dissolve into latitudinarianism.
Of these the first two
scarcely require to be illustrated; yet
we may notice one singular illusion
which has done more than any thing
else to give a fictitious unity to the
Protestant sects, and to invest their
protest with a certain air of virtuous
indignation; we refer to the common
belief that the Bible is in some sense
their peculiar possession, which springs
from the doctrine that, so long as a
man professes to get his creed out of
the Bible, and the Bible only, it matters
little of what articles his creed
consists. This fiction has done good
service in its day; but the Protestants
are now likely to be worried by the
fiend with which they used to conjure.
They received the Bible from the
church, and they turned it against the
church. Now they find it in the
hands of the modern critical school
turned against themselves.</p>

<p>That the Protestants who separated
from the church should have been
able to accept Scripture as binding
upon them, is not strange; although
to a philosophical mind at the present
day, the Protestant theory must present
insurmountable difficulties. When
men break off from a system in which
they were born and bred, they cannot,
if they would, make of their minds a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula rasa</i>, freed from all prejudices
and associations, ready to receive
whatever can be proved purely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>.
To attempt this would be to attempt
to move the world without a
fulcrum. The question, What can be
proved <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>? is one which requires
the course of many generations only
for its statement; as for its solution,
that may be said to have proved itself
impossible. Men are obliged, when
they change their opinions in some
respects, to allow their conduct to be
influenced by those opinions which
they do not change; and in some
cases it happens that it is impossible,
upon any <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> ground whatever,
to draw the line between what they
keep and what they reject. So it was
at the foundation of Protestantism;
and the effects of the modern "universal
solvent" are due to what we
have just stated, that, taking what <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a
priori</i> ground you will, there is none
which will support the Protestant without
landing him at last in contradiction
or absurdity. Thus, men in the
sixteenth century could easily accept
theories of Scripture interpretation
which are now found to be untenable;
and the result is fatal to those
who are so deeply committed to the
untenable theories that the loss of
them involves the loss of their whole
intellectual groundwork.</p>

<p>For the Protestants cannot, as the
Catholic can, point to the striking
fact of a general agreement extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
over many centuries. We know that
the Protestant critics profess to pick
holes in the Catholic claim to general
agreement; but what a beggarly appearance
these attempts present when
they are contrasted with the whole
extent of the subject! What is the
value of the few specks they point
out in the vast current of ecclesiastical
history? They find so little to
say, that what they say is proved to
be the exception and not the rule.
But if we turn to their own case, what
a difference do we find! There we
have no question of pointing out
flaws here and there; it is all one
mass of flaws. Protestants may attack
the claim of the church; but they
themselves are not able so much as to
put forward a claim. Nor do they
venture to claim unity; some even
avow their preference for diversity.
Yet in practice we find them all acting
as though each thought himself
infallible.</p>

<p>This is the result of a very common
human weakness. Just as the founders
of Protestantism could quietly acquiesce
in many things which they had
imbibed from the Catholic world in
which they were educated, so their
successors quietly acquiesce in what
comes to them from their fathers; and
in both cases there is much which
cannot be systematically exhibited
without contradiction. But very few
men care to set about the systematic
exhibition of all that they profess to
believe or to act upon. If it were
otherwise, the Protestant theories of
Scripture would never have been set
up; and they are now falling before
the exertions of men who insist upon
having a clear view of what they are
called upon to believe. When the
reformers made their appeal to Scripture,
it was impossible for men of different
tempers, habits, and associations
to agree upon matters of interpretation,
even if the appeal had been made
in good faith. As it was, the appeal
was made subject to certain foregone
conclusions, none of which, perhaps,
could have been deduced from the
mere text by any scientific process of
exegesis. Servetus could not find the
doctrine of the Holy Trinity in the Bible;
and though he was little if at all to
blame, according to Protestant principles,
Calvin thought this failure worthy
of death. Luther found in the
Epistle of St. James much more
than he wanted, and therefore he
ejected it from the canon. Thus
the appearance of an appeal to a common
standard is an appearance only.
It has been found to cover the widest
variations both of doctrine and ritual.
The only result of professing to be
bound by the Bible is, that the text
is wrested to mean any thing. No single
system of exegesis, strictly applied
throughout and deprived of all external
suggestion or comment, will elicit
a consistent whole from the declarations
of Scripture. All sects can produce
some texts in their favor, and all
find some texts which they are obliged
to explain away. Inquirers are supposed
to bring to the task of examination
a previous reservation in favor
of the doctrines of their peculiar sect.
If they do not, they are denounced
as traitors and unbelievers, in spite
of the ostentatious demand for a free
inquiry. When Mr. Jowett proposed
to use for the elucidation of Scripture
those aids and methods which scholars
have applied with great success
to the profane classics, he was met
with something more than outcry; he
was actually persecuted. Yet his persecutors,
who kept his salary as professor
of Greek down to forty pounds
per annum when the other similar
professorships were raised in value to
four hundred pounds, had nothing to
offer by way of reason against his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
proposal. They stooped to effect
their object by using the blind prejudices
of country clergymen.</p>

<p>While the name of Scripture has
always commanded respect, and in
this way a sort of pretended unity has
seemed to bind together the sects
of Protestantism, every generation has
seen less and less ground for establishing
any thing like real visible communion.
Scripture is useless to this end,
because every party insists that it has
Scripture on its side. Since Luther
and Melancthon conferred at Marburg
with &OElig;colampadius and Zwingli,
the futility of conferences has
been growing more and more manifest.
But so soon as men despair of
establishing union by convincing their
opponents, they are driven, if they
desire union, to propose compromise
as the basis upon which to found it;
and in religious matters, compromise
means the surrender of faith to expediency.
Many attempts have been
made to induce the sects to coalesce
by declaring only that to be obligatory
in dogma which is common to
all, leaving every thing else in the region
of pious opinion; but a very natural
and even laudable party obstinacy
has always brought these attempts
to nothing. The only persons
who can approach such compromises
with a safe conscience are latitudinarians,
whose fundamental principle is
the denial that any dogma is of necessity
to salvation; and to the latitudinarian
this privilege is useless, because
his overtures are superfluous if made
to latitudinarians, while they are sure
to be rejected by the dogmatists. Yet
it is hard for the dogmatic Protestant
to justify the religious scruple which
makes him unwilling to treat with the
latitudinarian; for he is cut off from
the appeal to the "faith once delivered
to the saints," and forced to take
up his position on ground which can
equally well be claimed by his opponents.
The scruples of either side
are called prejudices by the other;
and neither can rebut the accusation
upon solid grounds of reason. A position
like this is unstable; and though
habit will enable a given set of men
to hold their ground firmly against
mere argument, yet argument does
tell in the long run, and an unreasonable
position cannot with security
be handed on to the next generation.
For the next generation is not born
under the same circumstances as the
former; and so it often happens that
the habit which swayed the fathers is
not formed in the children. Bit by bit
the ill-established creed rots away, as
the "universal solvent" is brought to
bear upon the whole; and thus successive
generations of Protestants are
apt to be pushed nearer and nearer to
latitudinarianism, sometimes without
any notice being taken of the change.
At length, perhaps, we see matters
culminate in some portentous vagary,
like that society which now exists, or
existed not long since in London,
which proposes to unite upon the basis
of assenting to nothing at all.</p>

<p>The connection between faith and
reason, and the influence which intellectual
processes may lawfully exercise
upon religious belief, are questions
of profound difficulty. But
without attempting to draw the line
exactly between what is right and
what is wrong, it may be possible
to assert with confidence of particular
cases that they lie on this or that
side of the line. We would not rashly
encourage persons who have been
brought up in any dogmatic system,
however ill-grounded or erroneous
we may think their belief, to set
about mocking their hereditary faith
upon the strength of a shallow scepticism;
still less would we employ
ridicule against errors which cannot
be ridiculed without shocking deep
convictions; because we think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
the cause of truth, in the long run,
loses more than it gains by such
means. But the logical weakness of
the Protestant position is made apparent
by the fact that it always
does give way before reason. England
has passed through many phases,
and one of these was a phase of rationalism,
that is, of appealing to
reason only as the ultimate ground
of religious belief. During that period
the popular religion sank into a
vague deism, together with a practical
code of moral decency. Yet,
during that time&mdash;the eighteenth century&mdash;the
Church of England was
peculiarly rich in men whom she esteemed
great divines; but theology
is excluded from the pages of these
theologians. We find little beyond
exhortations to the practice of virtue,
grounded upon appeals to good feeling
and the hope of reward; and
what ought to be the dogmatic side
of their teaching is occupied with
proofs of the reasonableness of Christianity,
or with statements of the evidences
of Christianity&mdash;a Christianity
which, in the popular mind, had lost
all hold upon the divinity of Christ.
Here, then, the old Protestant dogmatic
position had gone down before
reason; and its fall is the more notable
because reason was not polemically
directed against it. The men
who had renounced the dogmatic
position were the champions of the
church, nor had they the least suspicion
that they had surrendered every
thing to the other side except an
empty title. Circumstances had forced
them to take their stand upon reason;
and dogma was quietly and instinctively
dropped out of sight, simply
because it could not be defended
by them in their position upon that
ground. We shall see presently how
close, at this time, was the resemblance
between the orthodox and the
deist.</p>

<p>But in the change of circumstances,
which is the result of the course
of time, there is something to compensate
for this sinking and loosening
of the dogmatic foundations of the
Protestants. Something is gained in
the greater ease with which later
generations can shut their eyes to the
presence of certain troublesome facts;
and this is what Catholics mean when
they speak of the children of schismatics
as being less responsible than
their fathers for the schism in which
they find themselves. While the old
Protestants were quite ready to take
the Bible upon trust, they felt the
force of certain texts which do not at
all trouble their successors. No modern
evangelical or Presbyterian feels
any qualm of suspicion when he
reads the words, "This is my body,"
nor does he trouble himself to seek
out a plausible explanation. Macaulay
said that "the absurdity of a
literal interpretation was as great and
as obvious in the sixteenth century
as it is now." But, at all events, there
is this great difference between the two
centuries: that in the sixteenth, men
felt bound to give some meaning to
the text, while now, in the nineteenth,
they feel able to pass it over without
giving to it any meaning at all.
&OElig;colampadius and Zwingli were at
the head of the two principal sections
of the sacramentarian party,
who denied all real presence, and reduced
the eucharist to a mere commemorative
rite. There stood the
text, and they felt bound to explain it
somehow, so that it might agree with
their opinions. They assigned the
same general meaning to the whole,
but they could not agree on the
question whether "is" or "body"
must be interpreted by a kind of
metonymy, that is, saying one thing
and meaning another. The subject
is not a fit one for laughter; but it is
hard to read without laughing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
Andrew Carlstadt thought our Lord
pointed to his natural body, when he
uttered the words of the text. Men
must be sore pressed before they will
execute such wrigglings as these; and
there are many signs of the existence
of similar pressures at that day, from
which modern Protestants are more
or less relieved. Thus, Calvin was
obliged for the sake of consistency to
declare that Scripture shines by its
own light; while the moderns can
act as if it did without being obliged
to say so. Again, when Archbishop
Heath and his fellow-sufferers protested
against their deprivation by Queen
Elizabeth, she felt bound to make
some attempt to argue from the fathers
against the supremacy of the
pope, though she could have found
no pleasure in the task, because she
had so little to say for herself. Now,
when a modern Protestant uses arguments
of this sort, it is only to satisfy
his own private whims or scruples;
but Elizabeth was peremptorily
called upon to defend herself against
adverse public opinion.</p>

<p>Nothing seems simpler to a modern
Protestant than that a man
should take his stand on "the Bible,
and the Bible only;" nothing seems
more strange to any one who has considered
the various ultimate grounds
and hypotheses upon which religious
belief may be supposed to rest. It
is not necessary to be always obtruding
the question of ultimate grounds
upon men's notice, because it is not
required that all who believe shall
be able to produce an accurate statement
of the true ultimate grounds of
their belief. But such grounds must
be supposed to exist, and to be capable
of accurate statement; and the
statement of them is, at any rate,
fatal to the Protestant position. We
have seen how dogmatic theology
disappeared from the popular mind
under the rationalism of the eighteenth
century. And at the time of
the French revolution, it was found
that when men deserted the church,
they did not take their stand upon
the Bible, but on atheism; and that
when they ceased to be atheists, they
became Catholics again, not Protestants;
nor has Protestantism ever
made any large number of converts,
except in the sixteenth century. This
was a sore puzzle to Macaulay, as he
himself declares; but it is easily explained
on the principles we have
laid down. In the sixteenth century,
men had no thought of inquiring
about ultimate grounds of belief;
they were determined to believe something,
and they looked about for any
proximate ground which was near at
hand and plausible in appearance.
At the end of the eighteenth century,
the question of ultimate grounds had
occurred to many, and they had answered
that there were ultimately no
grounds for believing any religion at
all. When they changed this opinion,
and determined to have a religious
belief, they did not take up the Protestant
position, because it was exploded;
and the proof that it was exploded
lies in the fact that they did not
take it up. They could no longer
play the part of arbitrary eclectics,
selecting what they chose and rejecting
what they chose from the Catholic
system. They could not follow
the example of Calvin, who first stopped
short where he did, and then
helped to burn<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Servetus for going a
few steps further. The French revolutionists
were without any of those
convenient traditional drags which
hamper movement, and enable men
to stop short at arbitrary points.
They ruthlessly carried out their principles
into the wildest and most ferocious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>excesses, things for which no
logical consistency will compensate;
but they <em>did</em> carry them out. Therefore
they were in some sense incapacitated
for becoming Protestants,
because they had once known what
it was to carry out principles, and
there is no set of principles whatever,
which, if vigorously carried out, will
land a man in Protestantism.</p>

<p>Men who found their belief upon
the Bible alone, have first to determine
the canon, then to settle the
text, and lastly to interpret it. They
have three questions to answer: 1.
How is it known that the Bible is,
as a whole, the word of God? 2.
How is it known that the text is free
from material corruption? 3. When
men differ about its meaning, as they
notoriously do, who is to decide between
them? Until a reply is found
to these questions, their position is
open to attacks which cannot justly
be stigmatized as the result of a shallow
scepticism; and the best proof
of this is the fact that it always goes
down before reason. One or two
men of learning and ability may be
found to abide by the ancient ways;
but they are deserted by the great
majority of their fellows, and therefore
they are the exception and not
the rule. Who can pretend to doubt
in what direction the whole of the
learning and ability among the undergraduates
of Oxford has been
moving of late years? With hardly
an exception, all the most promising
among the young men have been
moving away from those stand-points
which Dr. Pusey finds necessary to
his position as a Protestant; and if
there be any exception to this general
movement, he only marks the
motion of the stream by standing still
himself. This is because our three
questions remain unanswered, while
those who attempt to find such an
answer as shall be acceptable to a
rational mind, are denounced and
persecuted. Yet these so-called liberals
have a right to demand to be
heard, and to be allowed to make out
what they can by fair argument; nor
has Dr. Pusey any right to be shocked
when they find things in Scripture
which he does not, except upon
grounds which, if he would rigorously
carry them out, would make
him a Catholic. In his present position,
we cannot guess how he would
attempt to answer Charlotte Elizabeth,
that great departed light of
the extreme evangelicals. An acquaintance
once suggested a doubt
about the inspiration of the book of
Revelation in these words: "You are
a person of too much sense to believe
that the binding up of certain leaves
between the covers of the Bible makes
them a part of it." This, in fact,
raised the question how the canon
is to be determined; and Charlotte
Elizabeth was staggered for a moment,
as she herself tells us. But
the battle was turned by the following
reply, which she piously believed
to be dictated by God: "If you can
persuade me that the book of Revelation
is not inspired, another person
may do the same with regard to the
book of Genesis; and so of all that
lie between them, till the whole Bible
is taken from me. That will
never do," etc. Having thus determined
the canon, she promptly provides
the interpreter. "Man can
tell me no more than that God has
clearly revealed" the Calvinistic doctrine
of election and reprobation;
"therefore, man cannot strengthen
a belief founded on the sure word
of God; <i>or if he tells me it is not revealed,
I know that it is; because I
have found it so, and relinquish it I
never can</i>." (<cite>Personal Recollections of
Charlotte Elizabeth</cite>, third edition, p.
134. The other passage quoted is at
p. 130.) Charlotte Elizabeth, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
the strength of this, deals out the
most uncompromising damnation to
those who <i>have found that it is not</i>.
And Dr. Pusey's estimable friend,
Mr. Burgon, is equally ferocious toward
those who doubt whether every
syllable, point, jot, tittle, and full
stop in the Bible is the express act
of God. It would be impossible,
we suppose, to convert the wood-and-leather
man of Martinus Scriblerus,
even though he "should reason
as well as most of your country
parsons."</p>

<p>Political circumstances have given
such peculiar interest to the career of
the Church of England that it deserves
to be placed in a class by itself,
apart from the other schismatical
bodies which sprang up at the
Reformation. Amid the storms of theological
controversy she has always
found a dubious sheet-anchor in the
state, which secured to her a certain
stability of political position, while it allowed
her to drift through many widely
different doctrinal phases. The
tameness with which she veered about
at the bidding of successive sovereigns,
and the ease with which great changes
were effected in her constitution,
show that, in puritan phrase, her
heart was not in the work. Historians
are equally astonished at the
power of the crown and the pusillanimity
of the people. And there is
ground for astonishment, though the
facts are often described in terms of
exaggeration. We are not to suppose
that the passing of an act of parliament,
or the "devising" of an ordinal
by Cranmer, made a change in religion
which was instantly felt through
all corners of the kingdom. Multitudes
had very vague notions of what
was going on, and the only people
who were thoroughly well informed,
the courtiers, had their eyes fixed on
church lands, not on theology. In
some parts of the country, as in Lancashire,
the change was little felt, and
the Catholic religion remains there to
this day a common heirloom. But in
the mass of the people we quite miss
that delicate spiritual sense, so keenly
alive to the slightest variation from
the faith, which gives such interest
to the struggles of the church with the
early heretics. When all has been
said in their favor, it cannot be denied
that the English have always
shown themselves somewhat supine
and spiritually sluggish. It is only the
"right to tax themselves" which appeals
to their energies with force
enough to stir up a rebellion. The
Scots took their religion into their
own hands; but the English were
contented to be led like sheep by Cecil
and Parker.</p>

<p>The fundamental profession of faith
of the Church of England, the Thirty-nine
Articles, labors under this
disadvantage, that it has never secured
to the Established Church any closer
union or more uniform dogmatic
tradition than has been secured to Protestants
in general by their common
possession of the Bible. Very significant
are those words in the <i>King's
Declaration</i> prefixed to the articles,
in which his majesty finds so much
comfort from the fact that nobody refuses
to sign the articles, in spite of
"some differences which have been ill
raised;" and that, when they differ,
"<i>men of all sorts take the articles of the
Church of England to be for them</i>."
What is the value of a formula which
has been found compatible with the
primacy both of Whitgift and of Sancroft?
Only once did the spirit of the
nation question the right of "men of
all sorts" to "take the articles to be
for them;" and that was when Dr.
Newman took them to contain the
Catholic faith. But this was due to
the national hatred of popery, not to
the stringency of the articles. Their
weak blast has never blown either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
hot or cold. They look like the offspring
of a union between inconsiderate
haste and the latitudinarian hankering
after conversions made by
compromise. They limit their confidence
like the sagacious Bottom.
"Masters, I am to discourse wonders;
but ask me not what; for if I
tell you, I am no true Athenian."</p>

<p>The Elizabethan pacificators were
of that sort who turn a country into a
wilderness, and then boast that peace
has been happily restored. Their Established
Church was not a religion,
but a machinery for enabling men to
dispense with religion in their daily
lives; and every attempt to graft religious
feeling upon its sapless stock
has ended in discord. Having no
efficient discipline, no central authority,
no energetic corporate action, no
audible dogmatic voice, and no intelligible
symbols of faith, and receiving
its hierarchy from the state with abject
submissiveness, it has never got so far
as to attempt to fulfil any of the functions
of the church. Its usual condition
has been that of a bundle of
differences held together by some
fleeting economy or the presence
of the state. Scarcely had it settled
down into any thing like an organized
polity, when the Puritan schism became
formidably apparent; and by the
accidental bias of political association,
the Churchman and the Puritan became
the champions respectively of
prerogative and of liberty. The church
rallied round the monarchy, because
the favor of the crown was the breath of
its nostrils; and persecution made the
Puritans ripe for rebellion, and therefore
ready to fight for the cause of
liberty in any shape. The men who
began the Great Rebellion were politicians,
not religious enthusiasts; but
they gained the day by enlisting on
their side that religious enthusiasm
which afterward declared that "the
Lord had no need" of the Rump Parliament.
When the intolerable government
of the saints had made inevitable
the restoration of Charles, the
Established Church came back with
the crown almost as naturally as the
court of chancery and the privy
council. Nothing could be more in
keeping than that the ecclesiastical
loyalty which had blossomed into the
divine right of kings under the earlier
Stuarts, should bear its fruit in passive
obedience after the restoration.
This much had been claimed by
Henry VIII. in that edifying manual,
<cite>The Pious and Godly Institution of
a Christian Man</cite>; and it now became
the touchstone of Anglican orthodoxy,
almost to the exclusion of dogmatic
considerations. It is true that
Archbishop Laud had long before begun
what he meant to be a theological
reaction; but in his scheme the
position of an altar or the use of a vestment
counted for more than the gravest
doctrinal questions, and he did not
scruple to act cordially with men
whose theological views differed very
widely from his own. Whatever claim
the Established Church may seem to
have made to doctrinal infallibility or
to magisterial decision, we think that
it will be found on closer inspection
to resolve itself into this, that every
preacher was allowed to propound
his own crotchets as infallibly true,
provided only that his fidelity to the
great dogma of passive obedience was
beyond suspicion. Yet the prominence
of this one proposition, and the
vehemence of the clergy in preaching
it, gave a certain aspect of unity to
the church, and somewhat resembled
the energy with which divine truth
should be taught. The establishment
has grown up into a great and conspicuous
edifice, imposing from its majestic
appearance and the apparent
solidity of its foundation, and endeared
to many by the recollection of sufferings
endured in a cause with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
it seemed to be inseparably bound up.
Her ministers "agreed in essentials;"
that is to say, in the fundamental
rules of morality and passive obedience.
It was the very strength of
the church's position which made the
violence of James II. so disastrous
to her influence. The clergy found
themselves before the horns of a fatal
dilemma, when they were compelled
to choose between their church and
their king. The people, long used to
hear that passive obedience was the
first duty of a Christian, saw with a
sceptical shock the defection of the
clergy from their most sacred tenet.
The non-jurors set up a fresh schism,
and the shattered establishment could
offer no effectual resistance to the
phlegmatic William and his latitudinarian
primate.</p>

<p>By the revolution the Anglican was
finally and for ever cut off from all
appeal to the living authority of the
church; and it is well worthy of note
that when the high Anglicans of this
century, after the tractarian movement
had set in, began to appeal to authority,
they could find no living authority
whither to carry their appeal, and
were forced to set up the dead authority
of books and records. At the
close of the seventeenth century, there
would seem to have been a good opportunity
for anticipating by a hundred
and fifty years the tractarian revival;
and perhaps we may regard the
career of the non-jurors as a proof that
Sancroft and his brethren were utterly
removed from every breath of the
Catholic spirit. Cut off at that time
from all appeal to authority, yet forced
to lay down some ground of belief,
it remained for the establishment to
choose between reason and the witness
of the Spirit, or the purer light
manifesting itself to the separate conscience
of the individual. This latter
had been the basis of independency,
and of those still darker sects which
sprang from independency during the
commonwealth. It had appeared that
this guidance might be made to lead
anywhere, except in any direction that
a sane man would choose, and therefore
it remained to put reason on its
trial. Thenceforth the appeal of the
Anglican was addressed to the reason
of his hearers, and the reasonable was
the basis of argument between parties.
Different men believed different things;
but each admitted that his creed must
stand or fall according as it should or
should not approve itself to reason.
That knowledge of God and of his
will which could be discovered by unaided
reason was styled natural religion;
and this was the whole of religion,
according to the deists. According
to the orthodox, natural religion
was an outline, true as far as it
went, the details of which were to be
filled in by revelation. It was an obvious
consequence of this view, that
such parts of Christianity as could not
easily be foisted in upon natural religion,
came to be rejected as popish
corruptions; and thus the distinction
between the orthodox and the deist
became at last very shallow. Bishop
Butler, a man of fervid piety and with
a natural bias toward asceticism, whose
disposition made him an exception in
many ways to the common tendency
of the age in which he lived, complains
that religion had in his day become
too reasonable to have any connection
with the heart and the affections.
The least deviation in any
direction from the surrounding dead-level
was looked upon with suspicion;
and Butler's <cite>Durham Charge</cite> caused
him to be accused of "squinting"
toward the superstition of popery.
After his death, it was said by many
that he had died a Catholic; and
Secker came forward with indignant
zeal to defend his memory from the
"calumny."</p>

<p>The depressing results of this prevailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
tone are well shown by its
effect on the religious views of such
men as Sydney Smith. A touch of
fanaticism has great claims upon our
respect, when it is seen in contrast to
the heathenism which regards a good
education and gentlemanlike manners
as the most necessary qualifications
for the spiritual guide. Those evangelicals,
the "patent Christians" of
Sydney Smith, were the representatives
inside the Church of England
of the feelings and aspirations which
animated the Methodists outside; and
if the church had been the same in
the days of Wesley that it was in the
days of Wilberforce, there would have
been no separation. We remarked
that the close of the seventeenth century
seems to have presented a good
opportunity for anticipating the tractarian
movement; but the times were
not ripe for it, and the attempt was
not made. Wesley did attempt to
anticipate the evangelical movement;
but the times were again not ripe, and
the attempt ended in extensive schism.
The evangelicals were the true forerunners
of the tractarians; and perhaps
the Methodists had opened the
way to both. And as the Church of
England first drove out the Methodists,
but acquired by the process a
certain capacity to endure Methodism,
so, perhaps, she drove out the Tractarians,
and acquired thereby a certain
leaven which enables her now to endure
with comparative equanimity the
presence in her bosom of men who
profess Catholic doctrine. The church
had no fixed spirit; she was put in
motion by the clamors of unstable
popular opinion; and popular opinion
is liable to be modified by the views
with which it is brought into contact,
even when it attacks them most fiercely.
Yet we think we see signs that a
time is coming when the comprehensive
shelter of the establishment will
no longer be open to all who choose
to stand under it.</p>

<p>During this century three great
movements have at different times
made inroads upon the dead-level
bequeathed by a former age. The
evangelical movement has had its
day, and its force is now spent; it
no longer does active work, but only
serves as a protest and drag. The
tractarian movement has passed into
a second phase; but it is still so far
vigorous that it makes progress; that
is, it increases continually the number
of exoteric members who hang upon
its skirts, while the esoteric members
become more and more thorough-going
in their assertion of Catholic doctrine
and practice. The third and
last movement is the critical, which is
an attempt imported from Germany,
and in England supported with great
ingenuity and learning, to set up a
criterion of religious truth and error
apart from the reception of the Catholic
scheme. For a long time there
was room enough for all these parties
to exist together; and if they quarrelled,
it was rather because they had
a taste for quarrelling than because
they were brought into collision. But
now there is no longer room for them,
and collision is imminent. We may
expect soon to see the battle fought
out between them; nor would it have
been delayed so long had there been
any ground solid enough for pitting
one against another. The English
ecclesiastical law is so vague that men
hardly dare to invoke it, even when
they hope to find it on their side; for
it is impossible to predict its course
with certainty, when once it is set
moving. But recent decisions have
tended more and more to bring out
this much, that an exact compliance
with the present law, so far as it can
be fixed, would be equally distasteful
both to the evangelicals and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
tractarians. It is, in fact, a compromise
constructed with unusual clumsiness,
which is now for the first time
being exposed to a searching examination;
and it is likely to meet with
the just fate of compromises, by being
found equally hateful to both
of the parties whom it was meant to
reconcile. The critical school, who
greatly outweigh the two others in
learning and ability, are more evidently
outside the letter of the present law,
though its machinery is too clumsy
to be used against them with any
great effect. But the matter will not
long be left in the hands of the present
law; and it is hard to foretell the
legislation of the future. Nobody,
we think, can now doubt that a few
years will see some great change,
either of secularization, or at least of
redistribution, in the ecclesiastical revenues.
A large section of the tractarian
party now cries out for disestablishment,
as the only way open to
them by which they may keep the
Catholic faith.</p>

<p>When the catastrophe to which we
are looking forward does come, no
doubt there will be some splitting up
of parties. Some, we hope many,
of the tractarians will be received into
the Catholic Church; and then it will
be seen whether the remainder will be
able to set up a free church, according
to their darling scheme. Many
of the evangelicals will doubtless join
the various dissenting bodies; and
some, perhaps, will coalesce with the
liberals, (whom we called the critical
school,) and it is possible that these
latter may be left for a little while in
possession of the whole of the temporalities
of the church. This, however,
we do not think likely; it is probable
that disestablishment will be itself the
occasion of a general dissolution. But
the liberals have this great advantage
on their side, that they are under no
temptation whatever to split up. The
agreement which holds them together
is an agreement to differ; and their
bond of union is a protest against all
persons who consider dogmatic opinions
of any kind to be a sufficient
ground for breaking communion.
Upon this understanding they are
ready to shake hands with the whole
world. And the opinions which are
held by the esoteric members of the
party (for some of them have opinions)
are always embraced subject to
the admission that they may possibly
be false. They find truth everywhere,
and close resemblances between things
which are totally different. A bigot,
according to the old joke, is a person
who says that he is in the right, and
that every body who differs from him
is in the wrong; but a liberal is afraid
to say that he is in the right, lest he
should be obliged to say that somebody
else is not. They avoid mistakes
by saying as little as possible,
and by using the vaguest terms they
can find; and, above all, by cheerfully
admitting that there is always a
great deal to be said on both sides.
As certain of their own poets have
said,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Methinks I see them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through everlasting limbos of void time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twirling and twiddling ineffectively,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And indeterminately swaying for ever."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But it is only fair to say that here
they are seen in their weakness, not
in their strength. This vague and
undecided habit of mind is the result
of the circumstances in which they
had their beginning. The spectacle
of a great number of sects, each in
practice arrogating to itself infallibility
while they teach incompatible doctrines,
produces different effects upon
different minds. Its natural effect
upon the shallow, who are just deep
enough to find out that other sects
exist beside the one in which they
were brought up, is to breed scepticism.
They know that two contradictory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
propositions cannot both be
true, and they think that the one is
as well supported by evidence as the
other; and out of these premises, by
the help of bad logic, they draw the
conclusion that both must be false.
But sounder intellects set about investigating
more closely the criterion
of truth and falsehood; and to such
we owe the critical theory, which is
not only ingenious, but even true so
far as it goes. Something of the indecision
of men who have seen so much
of error that they now hardly believe
in the existence of truth, clings to
these critics; and this makes their
proceeding seem to be sceptical when
it is not really so. Their theory may
be briefly summed up as follows: "Interpret
the Scripture," says one,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> "like
any other book." This in his mouth
was a brief way of bidding us measure
religious truth by the same tests,
while we seek it by the same methods,
as other truth. It is well known that
the labor of successive generations of
scholars, following the same main rules
of criticism, has made a great approach
to uniformity in the interpretation of
profane authors; and nobody doubts
that the common consent of the critics,
if it could be obtained, would be
the best possible evidence to the unlearned
of the true meaning of an obscure
passage. It is inferred that the
same critical methods may be applied
to the Bible, and that the same approach
to uniformity of interpretation
may thus be secured.</p>

<p>This is a plausible theory; and it
is sound so far as it goes. But it
completely ignores the Catholic theory
of the interpretation of Scripture. Its
authors evidently suppose, for example,
that if a text quoted by the Council
of Trent in support of a doctrine
could be critically proved irrelevant
to the purpose, then the doctrine
would be seriously shaken in the
minds of Catholics. But this opinion
rests on a profound misapprehension
of the Catholic view. We accept the
doctrine on the authority of the council,
as the voice of the church, without
criticising the source from which
the words are drawn; and although
the church in her decisions is guided
by her unalterable tradition, yet it is
a possible case that she might be quite
assured of the fact of the tradition,
and yet (to speak reverently) erroneously
quote a document in evidence.
A Catholic would be very cautious
about attributing critical errors of this
kind to a general council; but no
theologian will deny that such a thing
might happen. The function of the
church in interpreting Scripture is by
no means limited to ascertaining what
the words written represented to the
mind of the writer; the question is much
wider than this, including all that was
intended by God to be conveyed or
suggested by the written words to the
church at large. It does not follow
that, because a given meaning is the
only sense which the words could appropriately
bear at the time when
they were written, therefore no other
additional sense was intended to be
conveyed at some future time. In
proportion as we exalt the degree in
which a passage or a book is supposed
to be inspired, so much the more
probable does it become that its
words will bear more than one meaning.
In the higher sense of the word
inspiration, the human agent becomes
a mere instrument to convey a message,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
which he himself may possibly
not understand at all. The meaning
then lies wholly in the mind of God;
and it is to be sought out by the divinely
appointed interpreter. Hence
is apparent the reasonableness, when
they are taken together, of the two elements
which make up the Catholic
theory of Scripture&mdash;the inspiration
of the written word, and the commission
of the church to interpret. Both
these things are ignored or denied
by that school of criticism about which
we have been speaking. Their view is
quite incompatible with the Catholic
view of inspiration, and they at the
same time naturally deny the right of
interpretation to the church, in order
to give it to the scholar. And they
therefore limit the function of interpretation
to that which the scholar can
reasonably attempt&mdash;the discovery of
the meaning appropriate to the circumstances
under which the words
were uttered.</p>

<p>The theory, as it stands by itself, is
a plausible hypothesis, much better
able to bear examination than any
other theory which Protestants have
ever put forward. We do not think
that it will fulfil the hopes of its friends,
by securing the wished for uniformity
of interpretation. And we cannot help
thinking that its adherents ought to
be on their guard against their peculiar
faculty of finding out likenesses in
dissimilar things, lest they should deceive
themselves by fancying that they
have secured uniformity when they
have not. At present, they are rather
apt to mistake the progeny of their
neighbors for their own&mdash;</p>

<p>A few years ago, one of them placed

<h2>THE SAGACIOUS WIG.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>A wig may be said to have two
lives&mdash;the one with its own head, the
other with its adopted head, or rather
the head which adopts it; it has, therefore,
a double chance for wisdom, and
might be expected to profit accordingly.
Generally speaking, this is the
case, and wig and wisdom are almost
synonymous.</p>

<p>Such wonderful tales had been told
in a certain shop, by wigs that came
back to be <i>fixed a little</i>, of the glory
of their new abodes&mdash;wigs shorn from
the very dregs of the people&mdash;from
heads that had never been combed or
petted or cared for&mdash;from heads houseless
and hatless, that had been rained
on and hailed on, and now in their
second life dwelt in splendor unmitigated&mdash;that
their discourses fairly
curled up tighter every wig in the
place. The shop had proved but a
stepping-stone to blissful companionship
with wits and statesmen; they
reposed on the brows of sages and
philosophers, shared the applauses of
the multitude with popular orators,
listened to the eloquence born of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
champagne and gaslight, and won
the smiles and flirted with sweet ladies
on Turkish divans and velvet <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fauteuils</i>;
all this and more, the wigs who came
back had to relate. No wonder hopes
were raised in each that went forth&mdash;hopes
often delusive.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>If the few hairs which made a kind
of rim round the head of Martin Tryterlittle
had chosen to speak when he
first clapped a wig on his bald crown,
(bald though not yet old,) they could
have told a long story, or rather a
succession of many stories, of hope,
expectation, and disappointment in the
three great walks of life&mdash;money-making,
love-making, and fame-making.
Striving, ever striving, he hardly
paused to look back at the profitless
path he had trodden. The meeting
accidentally with an old school-chum
in fine broadcloth, or the ultra urgency
of his landlady or some other disagreeable
creditor, gave him occasionally
more vivid views of things, and at
such times he indulged in indignant
and certainly very disrespectful language
toward mankind in general and
some individuals in particular; but
generally his mood was patient endurance.</p>

<p>Success in life was an enigma. There
was Job Lovemee, who began his
career by ridiculously marrying a girl
as poor as himself, and blessed since
with six children, was getting as rich
as a nabob; "while I," said Martin,
"with no such drawbacks, am as poor
as a church mouse."</p>

<p>It was a pleasant bright spring
morning when Martin Tryterlittle suddenly
resolved to turn over a new leaf
in his book of life and mend its story.</p>

<p>"No wonder I cannot succeed," said
he; "look at me!" So, as no one was
by, he looked at himself, bit at a time,
in the little cracked mirror which
adorned his attic lodging-room. As
the fortunes of Martin had been gradually
sinking in the scale of social existence,
he had physically been rising;
that is, from occupying the first floor
handsomely furnished, as the advertisement
set forth, he had ascended to the
attic, so nearly unfurnished that a bed,
a table, a chair, and a broken mirror
comprised its whole inventory.</p>

<p>"Look at me!" said Martin to himself,
"threadbare and bald! No wonder
I find nothing to do and no one to
woo, and stay lagging behind in this
march of mankind! I'll buy a wig
to-day if I have to sell something to
pay for it; for every body can see my
head, but nobody&mdash;well, I'll button
up my coat!"</p>

<p>It was no one's business how it was
accomplished, as Martin truly said,
but it <em>was</em> done; the wig was bought
and paid for, and rested now on his
table in happy anticipation of the
triumphs of the ensuing day. "No one
will know me," said he. "I hardly
know myself! O my wig! how happy
we shall be; to thee shall I owe friends
and fortune!"</p>

<p>It may startle some old-fashioned
people to hear me assert that there
was a responsive chord in the wig
which answered to all this; but those
familiar with modern metaphysical
speculations will easily credit it. The
wig, be it remembered, was once part
and parcel of a sentient being; nor
have we any reason to suppose that
baking and boiling, in the process of
wig-making, could in any way touch
the spark immortal and invisible which
once pervaded it. It is true that
counter arguments might be advanced,
and so there is no end to controversy;
but there is a shorter way&mdash;and having
demonstrated how the thing <em>might</em>
have been, we are satisfied to believe
that so it <em>was</em>. Martin felt that his
wig understood him. He was no
longer alone in the world; companionship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
is something even with a wig,
and he realized it as he laid his purchase
carefully on the table and betook
himself to his bed.</p>

<p>It was a long night; but day dawned
at last, and, in the mean time, the
whole future had been mapped out in
the mind of Martin Tryterlittle. He
rose early, made a careful toilette of
such materials as were to be had, and
sallied forth in thoughtful mood.</p>

<p>"Fame, wealth, love"&mdash;he conned
them over in the order of valuation.
"Fame (said he) I must first secure,
and then I can command my own
price in every thing else. Wealth
will follow; and as for love, I need
not go after that. Lord! there is no
end to the love that comes tumbling
in upon fame and money!"</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est le premier pas qui coute</i>&mdash;the
problem was, how to be famous. There
was a military and a civil career. There
was invention in all the arts subservient
to human needs. Could any
wheels anywhere be made to go faster
or smoother or with less smashing
up? Well, as far as he saw, every
thing was as good as it could be.
Literature? Ah! that is a long track;
besides, publishers are "lions in the
way"&mdash;they cannot or will not always
appreciate merit; fame seldom
comes to the scribe till after he is beyond
the reach of earthly pain or
blame. "No," said Martin, "I must
be famous living; what matters it
after one is dead?"</p>

<p>"What is all this jabber about?"
thought the wig; "surely my master
has so many ways before him he cannot
tell which to choose; but so
jauntily I sit on his brow, he cannot
fail of success whichever he takes."</p>

<p>This cogitating mood brought them
step by step to a corner&mdash;one of those
comers peculiar to great cities; where,
while down one wide avenue the
mighty human tide goes rushing and
roaring, the narrow side street, like a
little sluggish stream with scarce a
perceptible ripple, joins it and empties
its trifle into it. At this moment the
usual tide in the great thoroughfare
was swollen to a torrent; in plain
words, at the corner Martin encountered
a mighty mob. Hark! what a
rabble shout! pell-mell&mdash;something
had happened. Somebody had sinned,
and very vindictive seemed the sufferers.
Martin was caught in the current
and twirled into their midst.
Then was heard, "Oh! the man had
a wig on!"&mdash;"wig!" "man!" "man!"
"wig!" It went from mouth to mouth.
Well, here was a man with a wig on in
their midst; this must be he. The logic
was conclusive; so Martin was seized
and hurried along.</p>

<p>"What have I done?" cried he.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, you know what you've
done; and we know what you've
done," shouted a dozen tongues. So,
pinioned close, he was borne onward
to the halls of justice, or injustice, as
the case might be.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" thought the wig; "I
little expected to get in such a fix with
my gentleman, or I should have
clinched his bald pate till he would
have been glad to leave me for some
other customer. It is disgraceful!"</p>

<p>"It's villainous! it's outrageous!"
roared Martin.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" said a looker-on.</p>

<p>Now came a medley of questions
and cross-questions, and ejaculations,
and assertions, and confirmations,
and contradictions, and, in short,
the usual path of law and order was
trodden over, till they settled down
to unanimity on one point: the evil
deed, whatever it was, (and very few
seemed to know exactly what it was,)
had been done by a man in a wig;
but then it was a yellow-white, frowsy,
sunburnt sort of a wig. Who could
ever suspect that mass of dark, glossy
curls of concealing a rogue? No one.
So Martin was dismissed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
galling consciousness that for the
great wrong done him there was
no redress. A great wrong, too, he
felt it; for what was he henceforth?
Why, the very boys in the street would
point to him as "the one wot was
took up." He shrank from being
seen; he had been too famous already.</p>

<p>He turned his steps homeward to
collect his thoughts and rearrange his
dress.</p>

<p>"This comes of a wig," said he;
"a wig is deception, deception is rascality.
A man guilty of one deception
must not take it in dudgeon that
he is suspected of another. I scorn
fame! I go for money; and money
shall make me famous. I began at
the wrong end."</p>

<p>"Yes," (chimed in the wig,) "we'll
be rich and loved; and the rest is all
bosh."</p>

<p>It took Martin Tryterlittle a long
time to put himself again in presentable
order; one more such adventure,
and he would be obliged to cease
intercourse with that portion of creation
who walk in sunlight, and join
the human owls who, from choice or
necessity, fly only by night. Their
ways are not so widely different as
a casual observer might suppose.
Money is dear to both, and both are
fond of taking short roads to it. Only
in one thing they differ vastly&mdash;the
day-worker sighs and seeks for notoriety,
and often fails to obtain it; the
night-prowlers have it thrust upon
them, though they shun it. Martin
had shared their hapless luck, and his
ideas were changed; henceforth he
scorned fame in all its phases, and
exalted that other idol&mdash;money.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>A second time day-dawn called up
Martin and his wig for new projects.
It was a glorious morning. There
was something exhilarating in that
yellow flood of light which promised
success. It was so cosmopolitan&mdash;that
sunlight! It gave to all things
such a gloss of delicate beauty. First,
it just touched with gold the spires,
and tallest trees and chimney-tops;
then it slid down the house-side to
peep in my lady's chamber; then it
poured a glow all over the pavement,
and made merry and warm all the
little things, animate and inanimate,
which but for that would have been
dark and cold. Into this atmosphere
of joyousness walked forth now Martin
Tryterlittle to find something to
do, some fellow-creature with a want
unfilled.</p>

<p>It is surprising that any one ever
begins to do any thing in this world,
where every avenue to success is
crowded, every necessity supplied, and
every evil surrounded by a belt of antidotes;
it takes immense penetration
to discover where there is left any
thing to be done.</p>

<p>"I must find a <em>want</em>," said he.
And he turned to that dragon ever
watchful of human interests&mdash;a newspaper.
The <em>wanted</em> there were many&mdash;workers
for metals, accountants
for wealth, delvers for the riches of
earth; but all these anticipated a
certain previous training. <i>Wanted, a
teacher.</i> "That's it," said Martin.
"I think I am fitted for that." So he
moved on to the field of action&mdash;the
institute.</p>

<p>The building was easily found&mdash;a
large brick pile surrounded by grass,
or rather, what would have been grass
had juvenile footsteps permitted. To
point the searcher for knowledge to
the proper entrance, its name was displayed
there in conspicuous letters.</p>

<p>The master was not so accessible;
and he sat a long time in the parlor
with several other visitors, and listened
to the tinkling of sundry little bells,
and saw passing in the distance sundry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
little processions armed with
books and slates, until they were all
properly impressed with an idea of
the extent of the establishment and
the awful responsibility of conducting
it. At length, slowly and with dignity,
entered Mr. Pushem.</p>

<p>"A teacher, you want?" modestly
inquired Martin.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the laconic reply;
and a little silence ensued.</p>

<p>"For what, sir?" again modestly
asked Martin.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, for several things; in
fact, sir, for most any thing."</p>

<p>So, as Martin announced himself
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</i> on all subjects, and the salary,
without decided specification,
was declared by the dignified principal
to be unquestionably liberal, and
the duties could not well be defined
until he entered upon them; and as the
only positive point was that he was
to be niggard never in either time or
labor, for the reason that time and
labor were dust in the balance compared
with the progress of immortal
minds, the applicant was regularly
enlisted under the banner of
the <span class="smcap">Institute</span>. He was to pay his
board and lodging of course, said Mr.
Pushem; and, of course, Martin did
not expect to board and lodge without
pay, though he had some remembrance
of having done so occasionally;
and so the matter was
settled, and he returned home.</p>

<p>It took him small time to pack his
bundle. His trunk had been detained
a long time ago by a savage old
dame for rent; and, knowing that the
same gulf yawned ever for all succeeding
trunks, he had never replaced it.
So, packing his little bundle, I say,
and leaving a kind message for his
landlady with a fellow-lodger, to the
purport that he would come back and
pay her as soon as he could, he vanished
from his old abode as effectually
as if he had gone to another planet.</p>

<p>Loving parents tell us there is nothing
so delightful as watching the
daily progress of children in learning
the alphabet of life. Not that villainous
regiment called A B C, which
merits execration as the first herald of
toil and sorrow to the infantile heart,
but that beautiful alphabet of rosy
hues and rainbow colors, stamped on
leaf, and flower, and fruit, and wave,
and hill-side, and which, in conning
over, the little eye learns to see, and
the ear to hear; and the touch refines
itself, and fragrance grows to be an
idea; and the little gourmand makes
its first essay in luxurious living on
peaches and berries. Every little incident
here is delightful. But not so
pleasant is it to note the later wanderings
of human beings in quest of that
vague thing&mdash;<i>a living</i>. The traveller
on the highway of life has grown weary
now, and stumbles and plunges
ankle-deep in all things disagreeable.
He has heard the bird of promise
sing so falsely, he knows how little the
song is worth&mdash;he has grown sad
while growing wise; and thus plodded
on Martin Tryterlittle.</p>

<p>Some months had passed now since
the roof of the institute first sheltered
him; and the bread and bones and
watery tea of the institute first nourished
him; and the boys harassed
him, and made fun of him; and twigged
his wig, and put nettles in his
bed in more than a metaphorical
sense. His master had kept him like
a toad under a harrow, (to use an inelegant
but expressive phrase,) always
doing, never done; the salary was yet
unsettled, and the duties undefined,
when one night the wig claimed a
hearing.</p>

<p>"I am growing shabby," said the
wig, "and you are no richer."</p>

<p>Not that these words were uttered
in an audible tone, but the thought
passed to Martin and was comprehended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are growing shabby," sighed
Martin, ruthfully gazing, "and I am
no richer."</p>

<p>"O master mine!" quoth the wig,
"do you see how you are walking
on? You are growing poorer, not richer!
What is to you all the glory of
this concern, when you own not even
a nail in the wall? You are just the
stone they step on who mount up
over you. What do you get for it?
O master mine! you are an ass to
stay!"</p>

<p>Martin was not inaccessible to reason;
he was impressed daily more
and more with the good sense of his
old friend Horace.</p>

<p class="center">
"Et genus et virtus, nisi cum re, vilior algÃ¢ est."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a><br />
</p>

<p>His rusty garments and diminished
bundle told him that the wig spoke
truth, and he prepared, not for a hegira,
but for an official resignation.
It took no long time for this, and his
little hard bed in its windy corner
was left empty the very next night.
The boys felt that a great source of
amusement had departed, and sincerely
regretted his loss; and Mr. Pushem,
after due astonishment at such blindness
to advantages, disbursed to him
the smallest possible sum as balance
due, and advertised for another teacher.</p>

<p>O gold, gold! <i>Slave of the dark and
dirty mine!</i> what need to record how often
thou didst beckon on luckless Martin
Tryterlittle, only to flit from him
further than ever? What matters how
he slept in back offices and front basements,
dreaming of mines somewhere
at the antipodes, of which he was to
have such a glittering slice&mdash;or of
lovely landscapes away off in the vast
wilderness of which he would one day
be landed proprietor?&mdash;that is, as soon
as he could persuade certain people
into certain projects which seemed in
theory mighty attractive, but proved
in practice to have no attractions
whatever&mdash;suffice to say that at last,
quite desponding, he invested most
part of his few remaining coin in the
prepayment of an attic, and seated
himself sadly at its window.</p>

<p>"I shall never be rich," quoth he;
"fame and fortune!&mdash;well, let them
go." His heart threw a sigh to the
other one of the trio, and the wig took
it up. "I was born for love," said the
wig; "the first sweet words I remember
came from the rosy lips of our pretty
shop-girl, <i>What a love of a wig!</i> I have
never yet had a fair chance in life.
What care those bankers and old money-scrapers
for good looks? They are
all gray and bald and wrinkled before
their time. Put me on my own field,
master, and <span class="smcap">SEE</span> what <em>I</em> can do!"</p>

<p>Perhaps this prompted Martin to
lean further out of his window, and
thus give his wig the full benefit of
sunlight and the chance of making
acquaintances; at least he did so; and
doing so, he glanced across the street to
a window nearly as high as his own, and
saw there&mdash;what? Why, two bright
eyes looking intently at him! He drew
back; for Martin was diffident with
the fair sex, and being, besides, innately
a gentleman, it did not occur to
him to embarrass the damsel with a
rude stare. So he retreated; and the
bright eyes also retreated and what
was worse than all, a little, plump,
white hand came out and closed the
shutters.</p>

<p>Nothing more was seen all day;
but he had ample occupation in conjecturing
who it could be. No toil-worn
seamstress ever had such a laughing
glance and such a plump little hand;
no, it was evidently a maiden quite
above care for the morrow. Most
anxiously he awaited the following
morning, when about the same hour&mdash;that
is, early day&mdash;could he believe his
senses?&mdash;again the shutter was opened,
and the bright eyes glanced up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
him as if they too remembered. The
little fairy was evidently a household
fairy engaged in some fairy-like duties
about the chamber, and ever and anon,
as these brought her near the window,
she glanced up at Martin.</p>

<p>That any loving and lovable woman
should bestow a thought on <em>him</em>
was a leaf of paradise painted in
dreams sometimes on the far-off days
to come, when he should be rich and
renowned; but that such bright, happy
eyes should seek and rest on poor
Martin Tryterlittle was hardly credible;
as soon would he have expected
Luna to step down from her orbit,
peep into his attic, and say, "Good
evening to you, Martin;" but so it
was.</p>

<p>"It is <em>my</em> doing," said the wig;
"all mine!"</p>

<p>One day was the story of the next,
and the next, and several more beyond.
It is surprising how much
may be learned of the inhabitants of
a house from its exterior. As the beatific
vision lasted but a short time
each morning, a long day and night
was left him to study its surroundings,
and in a brief space of time he read
the whole plain as a book. It was a
handsome mansion, and a private one.
There was a sensible housekeeping
mistress there; for the railings were
black and the knocker bright, and the
steps were clean and the housemaids
tidy; even the pavements were a pattern
to the neighbors. There were
order and industry throughout the
establishment, evidently. All this and
more besides he deciphered by processes
whose intricate premises laughed
to scorn quadratic equations, and
yet he was never tired.</p>

<p>Martin had done, here and there
and everywhere in his lifetime, a
deal more head-work than he had
ever been paid for, rather by compulsion;
but now he labored <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</i>
on the loveliest subject life affords;
and so far from wearying him, his wits
grew brighter, his ideas received a
new impetus, and, strange to say, the
beneficial influence extended to his
purse.</p>

<p>"I must have some honest occupation
now," cried he; "it will never
do to introduce myself as lounger in
an attic window!" Yes! he really
dreamed of an introduction.</p>

<p>"Let me see," (and he picked up
his old dragon friend the newspaper;)
"<i>wants, wants</i>&mdash;small salary, etc.;
well, I will try." So he speedily bargained
himself away to&mdash;no matter
what, so it was honest, and went to
work with a good-will.</p>

<p>It was pleasant, too, (strange he
had never thought of it before;) it
was pleasant to have a defined place
among his fellow-mortals, and to feel
that he could not now, as heretofore,
be blown away on some windy day,
and no one miss him.</p>

<p>Great changes are not wrought in
a day. It took him some time to
straighten out his line of existence
and untie all the knots he had always
been tying in it; to settle up scores
with the past, and open accounts with
the future&mdash;but it was all accomplished;
and see now the life of Martin
Tryterlittle.</p>

<p>He rose betimes, drank an elixir
from those bright eyes perfectly intoxicating,
and speeded to business.
At eventide&mdash;where think you he
spent his evenings? Why, in the
back-parlor of that same handsome
mansion, with little household fairy at
his side, and papa smiling approval.
He was no longer threadbare and
shabby, and the only bit of deception
about him&mdash;his wig&mdash;had been long
ago confessed and forgiven.</p>

<p>"I'm a deal better than any hair
that ever grew on any man's head,"
said the wig; "for if you live to be a
hundred years old, I shall never be
bald or gray."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will never be bald or gray,"
said Martin.</p>

<p>"It will never be bald or gray,"
laughed the little fairy.</p>

<p>On a certain evening about a year
after this, Martin and his wig sat down
for the last time to their dual converse;
the next day a little lady was to be
admitted, and the partnership would
be a trio. Martin reclined on a sofa
in his own domicil this night, and
looked on a soft, bright carpet. His
purse had filled up; nor was he unknown
to fame&mdash;at least to a holy
fame born of benevolence, which in
after years lighted up many a desolated
heart and hearth, and carved his
name on structures where the homeless
were sheltered and the hungry fed.</p>

<p>"Master mine," said the wig, "we
mistook our track. Human life was
not bestowed for the hoarding up of
money&mdash;or men would have been all
born with pockets; nor yet for a chase
after fame. There are innate, loftier,
and purer aspirations to be satisfied&mdash;the
living soul craves something to
love, and craves to be loved; and like
sunshine to earth, that brings forth golden
grain and sweet flowers, so pure
love, the household sunshine, calls out
wealth of thought and energy of action;
and so comes fame, and so
comes money!"</p>

<p>"Just so," said Martin; "you talk
like a book!"</p>

<h2>THE POPE AND THE COUNCIL, BY JANUS.<br />

<small>II.</small></h2>


<p>As the reader will have seen in our
previous article, it became necessary to
interrogate history at some length in
order to elucidate and substantiate
our arguments on the two points we
have already set forth, namely, the
real purpose of <i>Janus</i>, and the orthodoxy
which the authors of this
work profess. We have thus prepared
the way for our examination of the
historical and critical parts of <i>Janus</i>,
for which he has found so many ardent
admirers who would assign him
a "position in the very front rank of
science."</p>

<p><i>Janus</i> is principally hailed as a
work of history, and as such, makes
by no means ordinary or modest pretensions.
That promiscuous array of
matter presented to the reader in the
third chapter, subdivided into thirty-three
paragraphs with those numerous
references to "<i>original authorities</i>,"
has dazzled so many eyes and overpowered
so many minds, that they
could not "help feeling convinced of
its veracity." He has been held up as
a "thorough Catholic" and a "learned
canonist," and whether or not by
any legitimate and scientific criterion
<i>Janus</i> merits these encomiums, the
reader can infer from the unexceptionable
authorities we have advanced.</p>

<p>We now ask the simple question,
Has <i>Janus</i> shown himself to be "a
faithful and discriminating historian"?
Having already appealed to the verdict
of history on points of the very
first importance, we may confine ourselves
exclusively to the historical
merits of <i>Janus's</i> work. It cannot
be expected that, within the space allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
to such an examination, we can
touch upon every point; yet we trust
to be able to make such selections as
will be sufficient to clear up the most
important historical questions upon
which <i>Janus</i> himself lays most stress.
The following extract gives the key
to the historical edifice of <i>Janus</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In this book the first attempt has been
made to give a history of the hypothesis of
papal infallibility, from its first beginnings
to the end of the sixteenth century, when it
appears in its complete form." (P. 24.)</p></blockquote>

<p>To take away all historical basis
from "ultramontanism," the authors
go over the whole field of ecclesiastical
history, and particularly the lives,
both private and public, of the popes,
together with their acts of administration,
whether referring to the religious
or civil government; in short, any
thing and every thing is gathered "to
bring forward a very dark side of the
history of the papacy." The authors
pledge themselves to oppose what
they term the "ultramontane scheme,"
to which they will never submit, and
hence their appeal to history, which
should show that, since the ninth century,
the constitution of the church
has undergone a transformation neither
sound nor natural, because in contradiction
with that of the "ancient
church." But the question which
naturally suggests itself is, Who is responsible
for this movement in the
church, "preparing, like an advancing
flood-tide, to take possession of its
whole organic life"? A "powerful
party which, in ignorance of past history
or by deliberately falsifying it,"
is now about to complete its system
and surround itself with an "impregnable
bulwark," by the doctrine of infallibility.
To ward off so fatal a catastrophe,
<i>Janus</i> enters this protest,
based on history.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Only when a universal conflagration of
libraries had destroyed all historical documents,
when easterns and westerns knew
no more of their own early history than the
Maories in New Zealand know of theirs now,
and when, by a miracle, great nations had
abjured their whole intellectual character and
habits of thought, then, and not till then,
would such a submission be possible." (P.
26.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We have thus fairly stated the whole
issue. True enough, the ultramontanes
were not wise when they did not give
over to the flames all libraries, with
the exception of the Isidorian decretals,
as the Mohammedans are known
to have done with the library of Alexandria.
Yet we are happy to say
that such an expedient measure has
not been resorted to, being thereby
enabled to trace the truth or falsehood
of this "mighty programme" of ultramontanism
which <i>Janus</i> is pleased to
honor with the name of "Papalism."</p>

<p>We can easily dispense with the
alleged historical misconceptions of
the middle ages, and draw upon the
very same historical documents with
which <i>Janus</i> so confidently proclaims
his victory. Attention has already
been directed to the peculiar mode of
warfare pursued by <i>Janus</i>, namely, to
its purely negative and destructive
character. The third chapter bears
the title of "Papal Infallibility," (pp. 31-346,)
and hence we are led to expect
a clear, authentic, and fair exposition
of the doctrine in question, and then
all other arguments which, either from
scripture and patristic authority or
from history, could be brought to bear
against such a doctrine. No reasonable
man, much less a theologian, could
object to such a mode of proceeding.
The authors of <i>Janus</i>, wishing to cede
to none in their loyal devotion to
Catholic truth, could make ample use
of that liberty of scientific discussion
and historical investigation for or
against the question of infallibility,
and no charge of "radical aversion," as
they seemed to apprehend, could be
brought against their work.</p>

<p>Since <i>Janus</i> openly avows his purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
of disproving the doctrine of infallibility,
why does he not give such
an explanation of it as is taught by
its most able and acknowledged defenders?
What right has he to
produce a version of it to suit his
own fancy? Why bring up arguments
militating, indeed, against his
<em>own</em> theory, but in nowise conclusive
against the doctrine as laid down by
its own exponents? That it may not
appear as if we made unfounded
charges against <i>Janus</i>, we will subjoin
his own definition and development
of the doctrine he sees fit to attack:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When we speak of the church, we mean
the pope, says the Jesuit Gretser. Taken
by itself as the community of believers, clergy
and bishops, the church, according to Cardinal
Cajetan, is the slave of the pope."
(P. 31.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Apparently, our authors would make
this the ultramontanist tenet: henceforward
the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'Ã©glise c'est moi</i>" would
be the genuine expression of papal
infallibility. We know of no theologian
who sustains any such thesis as
the above, and we had expected a
<i>reference</i> to the authorities quoted;
but none is given, and we little heed
the utterances attributed to them.
Nothing, indeed, is easier than to place
a question in a false point of view,
either by exaggeration or misrepresentation,
in order to make it appear
ludicrous and absurd.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is a fundamental principle of the
ultramontane view that, when we speak of
the church, its rights and its action, we always
mean the pope, and the pope only." (P. 31.)</p></blockquote>

<p>There is no treatise on the church
in which any such definition is to be
found, or any author who declares the
pope alone to be the church, in any
possible sense or conception. <i>Janus</i>
delights to cite Bellarmine as one
of such ultramontane view. Now,
we confidently assert that nowhere
in his elaborate treatises on the
<i>Roman Pontiff</i> or the <i>Church Militant</i>
any similar definition to the one alleged
can be found. Who is there
who does not know that clear and
concise notion given by Bellarmine, in
which he has been followed by all
standard works? For he says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nostra autem sententia est, Ecclesiam
unam et veram esse c&oelig;tum hominum ejusdem
ChristianÃ¦ fidei professione, et eorundem
sacramentorum communione colligatum sub
regimine legitumorum pastorum ac prÃ¦cipue
unius Christi in terris Vicarii Romani Pontificis.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>"Our doctrine is, that the one true church
is that society of men which is bound together
by the profession of the same Christian
faith under the government of their lawful
pastors, and especially of one vicar of
Christ on the earth, the Roman pontiff."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following passages would exhibit
the ultramontane doctrine of
infallibility and its consequences:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"God has gone to sleep, because in his
place his ever-wakeful and infallible vicar on
earth rules, as lord of the world, and dispenser
of grace and punishment." (P. 32.)</p>

<p>"The inevitable result of the principle
would speedily bring us to this point, that
the essence of infallibility consists in the
pope's signature to a decree hastily drawn
up by a congregation or a single theologian."
(Preface, xxv.)</p>

<p>"Rome is an ecclesiastical address and
inquiry-office, or rather, a standing oracle,
which can give at once an infallible solution
of every doubt, speculative and practical....
With ultramontanes, the authority of Rome,
and the typical example of Roman morals
and customs, are the embodiment of the
moral and ecclesiastical law." (P. 35.)</p>

<p>"What is called Catholicity can only be
attained in the eyes of the court of Rome,
by every one translating himself and his
ideas, on every subject that has any connection
with religion, into Italian." (P. 37.)</p>

<p>"Infallibility is a principle which will extend
its dominion over men's minds more
and more, till it has coerced them into subjection
to every papal pronouncement in
matters of religion, morals, politics, and
social science."</p>

<p>"Every pope, however ignorant of theology,
will be free to make what use he likes
of his power of <i>dogmatic creativeness</i>, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>erect his own thoughts into the common belief,
binding on the whole church." (P. 39.)</p>

<p>"A papal decision, itself the result of a
direct divine inspiration."</p>

<p>"Every other authority will pale beside
the living oracle of the Tiber, which speaks
with plenary inspiration."</p>

<p>"What use in tedious investigation of
Scripture, what use in wasting time on the
difficult study of tradition, which requires so
many kinds of preliminary knowledge, when
a single utterance of the infallible pope ...
and a telegraphic message becomes an
axiom and article of faith?" (P. 40.)</p>

<p>"And how will it be in the future?" asks
<i>Janus</i>; "the rabbis say, on every apostrophe
in the Bible hang whole mountains of
hidden sense, and this will apply equally to
papal bulls." (P. 41.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We have been rather copious in our
extracts from <i>Janus</i> in order to give
him a fair hearing. The question
which first presents itself to a candid
mind is, Has <i>Janus</i> given a just and
authentic explanation of the doctrine
of infallibility? We answer most
emphatically, No! Never has a doctrine
been more unfairly represented
than this "ultramontane" one by
our authors. No one will choose to
call it fair and equitable to disfigure
and distort in divers ways the doctrine
of an opponent, how much soever it
may be against our own convictions.
Those who make parade of their
"scientific criticism" can least resort
to such tactics with a view to seek
popularity and win the smiles of the
uninformed and ignorant among their
readers, as the authors of <i>Janus</i> have
done. Who would fain recognize this
doctrine under the colors and shades
of this portrait sketched by <i>Janus</i>?
Bellarmine is the great champion of
infallibility. (P. 318.) Yet, nowhere
does this eminent divine teach that a
papal decision is the result of <i>divine</i>
inspiration, nor does he attribute to
the pope any power of dogmatic <i>creativeness</i>&mdash;much
less that he can erect
his own thoughts into universal belief
binding the church. "The sovereign
pontiff," says Bellarmine,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> "when he
teaches the universal church, cannot
err either in his decrees of faith or in
moral precepts which are binding on
the whole church, and in such things
as are necessary to salvation and in
themselves, that is, <em>essentially</em> good or
evil." Another authority well known
has the following clear <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exposÃ©</i> of this
question: "The subject-matter of
such irreformable judgments of the
sovereign pontiff is limited to questions
of dogmatic and moral import.
We distinguish a two-fold character
in the pope, namely, considering him
as a private individual or <i>doctor privatus</i>,
and by virtue of his office as chief
pastor and as the universal doctor
and teacher of all the faithful, appointed
by Christ. The pope is considered
as <i>universal teacher</i> when,
using his public authority as the supreme
guide of the church, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">supremus
ecclesiÃ¦ magister</i>,) he proposes something
to the whole church, obliging
all the faithful under anathema, or
pain of heresy, to believe the article
thus proposed with internal assent and
divine faith. The pope when teaching
under these conditions is said to
speak <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedra</i>. We do not here
speak of the pope as an individual
teacher, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">doctor privatus</i>,) since every
one agrees on this, that the pope, just
as well as other men, is liable to err,
and his judgment may be reversed."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Now, <i>Janus</i> does away with this
distinction by comparing it to "wooden
iron" invented merely as an expedient
hypothesis, whereas all theologians
of repute agree on this difference,
as well as on the <i>essential</i> conditions
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedra</i> decisions.
If there be some difficulties and minor
differences among theologians on papal
decrees, this by no means affects
the value of this important and necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>distinction itself. Even the decrees
of an &oelig;cumenical council may
give rise to similar differences among
theologians. It is nothing less than
a falsehood on the part of <i>Janus</i> that
the cause of this inerrancy claimed
for the pope as universal teacher is
due to direct divine and plenary inspiration.
All theologians are unanimous
in asserting merely a <i>divine assistance</i>
to guard against error, just as
the church herself is divinely guided
by the Holy Spirit, promised by Christ
to reside with her for ever. There cannot
be any necessity for substituting
inspiration or a new revelation, since
the infallible <i>magisterium</i> in the church
is exercised in the two-fold duty of
teaching and preserving <i>all those
truths</i> which she has received as a <i>sacred
deposit</i> from her divine Founder.
Moreover, it is supposed that the pope
when issuing such decrees to the universal
church, binding all the faithful,
proceeds with that caution and prudence
which such weighty acts demand,
that he has full liberty to assure
himself of all human counsel and human
means to find the true and genuine
sense of Scripture and tradition.
Alluding, therefore, to <i>ignorant popes</i>
making use of their power of dogmatic
creativeness and erecting their
"own thoughts" into dogmas of faith,
is an appeal to prejudice and commonplace
mockery wholly unworthy of
writers who would be admired for
their calm and dignified scientific labors.
Other opponents of papal infallibility
have never gainsaid that
<em>at least</em> this doctrine has always found
many and able adherents, who have
advanced strong arguments claiming
the serious consideration of every
theologian and thinking Christian, and
therefore recommended by most respectable
authority. But <i>Janus</i> comes
forward to stamp this "ultramontane
doctrine" with the stigma of absurdity
and ridicule, and declares its advocates
to be miserable sycophants,
devoid of all learning or honesty of
intention. (P. 320.)</p>

<p>The references we have given exhibit
the doctrine of infallibility in
such colors as scarcely to be recognized,
and all advocates of the doctrine
will repudiate such an unfair and
arbitrary statement. The cunning insinuation
that infallibility invests the
popes with personal sanctity and integrity
of morals, is no less captious
and shallow. To what purpose those
tirades on the private lives of the
popes, or the extravagances of the <i>Curia</i>,
and the administrative measures
of the civil government, etc.? The supposition
as though the whole church,
that is, all the faithful, would have to
accept falsehood for truth, vice for
virtue, is a play of <i>Janus's</i> imagination.
For those who uphold papal
infallibility exclude the possibility of
such an issue on account of the intimate
union necessarily existing between
the church and its spiritual
head. According to the promises of
Christ, that union&mdash;eminently one of
faith&mdash;will never be severed, since
Christ himself commanded this obedience
of the flock to Peter and his
successors. It cannot for a moment
be supposed that the wise Lord of
his vineyard sanctioned an obligation
to accept falsehood for truth, or vice
for virtue. The infallible <i>magisterium</i>
of the church would be fatally compromised
if the faithful were commanded
by lawful authority to give
interior assent to a false doctrine.
So much for the intrinsic falsehood
of the hypothesis of <i>Janus</i>. Yet he
attempts to surround it with an authoritative
garb by citing Bellarmine as
maintaining "that if the pope were to
err by prescribing sins and forbidding
virtues, the church would be bound to
consider sins good and virtues evil,
unless she chose to sin against conscience."
(P. 318.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>Who does not at once see this terrible
alternative by which <i>Janus</i> triumphantly
proves from the author
quoted "that whatever doctrine it
pleases the pope to prescribe, the
church must receive"? Having the
work of Bellarmine before our eyes,
with the above passage in the context,
we were greatly amazed, to say
the least, to see how the <em>entire</em> proposition
conveys just the very opposite
meaning of what <i>Janus</i> would
induce his readers to believe. Here
is the argument in question:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The pope cannot err in teaching doctrines
of faith, nor is he liable to err in giving
moral precepts binding the whole church
in matters of <i>essential</i> good and evil. For
if this were the case, that is, if the pope erred
in matters of essential good or evil, he
would necessarily err also in faith; for Catholic
faith teaches that every virtue is good
and every vice evil. Now, if the pope erred
by commanding vices or prohibiting virtues,
the church would be bound to believe vices
good and virtues evil, unless she chose to
sin against conscience."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Bellarmine's meaning evidently is
that such an issue becomes impossible.
This <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>, or
showing to what contradiction a denial
of his thesis would lead, has been
exhibited by our authors as a <i>bona
fide</i> tenet of Bellarmine! The passage
itself is <em>partly</em> transcribed with
minute reference, so that it is beyond
the courtesy of even a mild critique
to exonerate <i>Janus</i> from the charge
of deliberate dishonesty in this instance.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have confined ourselves
to a critical examination of a doctrine
against which <i>Janus</i> directs his assaults.
In the first place, we submitted
his version of the same, and afterward
the authentic explanation by
those whom our authors acknowledge
to be its most able exponents. The
inevitable conclusion which forces itself
on every mind is, that <i>Janus</i> has
developed the doctrine of infallibility
to suit his own fancy, and consequently
the arguments he brings forward,
supposing them true for discussion's
sake, would indeed undermine
the position assumed by himself, but
in no way affect the genuine one
propounded by his opponents. In
order to make good his arguments
from church history and canonical
sources against the stand-point taken
by the acknowledged advocates of
infallibility, these three conditions must
be verified, 1st. That the pope acted
in his capacity of universal teacher,
using his public authority as supreme
head of the church; 2d. That his
judgments appertain to matters of
doctrinal belief and moral law necessary
to salvation. 3d. That he proposes
such things to the faithful, under pain
of heresy, to be believed with interior
assent as of divine faith, that is, a revealed
truth. There is the simple issue
between <i>Janus</i> and his adversaries.
Has he advanced one single decree
of any pope, invested with these essential
conditions, obliging to believe falsehood
and heresy or commanding to
commit an evil and absolutely vicious
action under the name of virtue?
We doubt whether any candid and
discriminating historian will maintain
that <i>Janus</i> has accomplished any
such task. However, that the reader
may not suspect us of narrowing the
domain of papal infallibility, we will
quote a passage from an able and
warm adherent of this doctrine, whose
writings are well known as by no
means liable to any suspicion of under-statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the case of any given document, we
have to consider, from the context and circumstances,
which portion of it <i>expresses</i> such
doctrine; for many statements, even doctrinal,
may be introduced, not as authoritative
determinations, but in the way of argument
and illustration. Many papal pronouncements,
though they may introduce
doctrinal reasons, yet are not doctrinal pronouncements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
at all, but disciplinary enactments;
the pope's immediate end in issuing
them is, not that certain things may be believed,
but that certain things may be done.
If the doctrinal reasons, even for a doctrinal
declaration, are not infallible, much less can
infallibility be claimed for the doctrinal reasons
of a disciplinarian enactment. Then
again, the pope may give some doctrinal decision
as head of the church, and yet not as
universal teacher. Some individual may ask
at his hands, and receive, practical direction
on the doctrine to be followed in a particular
case, while yet the pope has no thought
whatever of determining the question for the
whole church and for all time. Much less,
as Benedict XIV. remarks, does the fact of
his acting officially on some moral opinion
fix on it the seal of infallibility as certainly
true. Nor, lastly, can any conclusive inference
be drawn in favor of some doctrinal
practice, from the fact of its not having been
censured or prohibited. The pontiff of the
day, whether from intellectual or moral defect,
may even omit censures and prohibitions
which are greatly desirable in the
church's interest, or enact laws of an unwise
and prejudicial character."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As we have already insinuated,
<i>Janus</i> makes this infallibility extend
to the private conduct of the popes,
to their particular sayings and to all
other things which were merely preliminary
steps to their official measures.
Now, it is certain, as is frequently
urged by ultramontanes, that
the pope, in becoming pope, does not
cease to be a man, and to have his
own private opinions, and not being
infallible in these, by the very force
of terms, they may be erroneous.</p>

<p>What we might thus far have conceded
to <i>Janus</i> without great injury
to the doctrine he opposes, we now
proceed to question, and examine this
"history of the hypothesis of papal
infallibility, from its first beginnings
to the end of the sixteenth century."
He has indeed resuscitated weighty
questions, and not unfrequently antiquated
difficulties which we could
point out from works printed for three
hundred years and more. In order
to be brief and clear, we shall begin
with the alleged "forgeries" upon
which <i>Janus</i> insists throughout his
book, and thereafter interrogate history
as to the many "papal errors,"
usurpations, and encroachments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The terms "faith," "heresy,"
and "under anathema," in the
foregoing article, must be understood
in their general and not their restricted
sense. That is to say, whenever the
pope declares or defines any thing
which is to be believed with absolute
interior assent, this is to be considered
as belonging to faith, whether it
be technically a proposition <i>de fide</i>, or
one which is only virtually and implicitly
contained in a dogma. So,
also, when he condemns an opinion
which is indirectly and virtually contrary
to a dogma of faith, this condemnation
is of equal authority with
the condemnation of an opinion technically
called heretical. The anathema
need not be formally expressed,
or a special censure annexed, if it is
made manifest that all Catholics are
forbidden to hold the opinion condemned
under pain of grievous sin.
The monition of the Council of the
Vatican at the end of the decree on
Catholic faith expressly enjoins on all
Catholics the duty of rejecting not
only all heresies, that is, opinions in
point-blank contradiction to the dogmas
of Catholic faith, but all errors
approaching more or less to heresy
which are condemned by the holy
see.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor of Catholic World.</span></p>

<h2>THE YOUNG VERMONTERS.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

A NEW ADVENTURE.</h3>

<p>All went on quietly with our
young Vermonters for a long time.
They were engaged in close attention
to their studies, in the regular routine
of school duties and recreations of
the play-ground, until late in August,
when the peaceful current was
again disturbed by the restlessness of
Frank Blair; and it happened in this
wise.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of the village lived
a farmer whom the boys had named
Old Blue Beech, from his fondness for
using a rod of that description over
the backs of lawless juveniles whom he
caught trespassing on his premises.
Now, this farmer was very skilful
in cultivating choice fruit, and spared
no expense or labor in that department;
rejoicing in an orchard which
he held in higher estimation than
any other earthly possession, and
which was an object of greedy envy
to the village urchins, who indulged
an inveterate spite and aversion
against him, without really knowing
why or stopping to inquire. They
seemed to imagine that his keeping
guard over his cherished treasures
justified them in making frequent
incursions, and waging a perpetual
warfare of petty annoyances against
him.</p>

<p>It so happened this year that he
had several early pear and apple-trees,
of rare and excellent varieties,
in bearing for the first time, and well
laden with most tempting fruit, now
nearly ripe.</p>

<p>Frank Blair set his wits about inventing
some plan by which he and
his comrades could possess themselves
of this fruit without detection.
He formed and dismissed many
schemes, at length devising one that
he thought could be safely carried
out. Accordingly, on a certain cloudy
evening an assemblage of the boys&mdash;among
whom I am sorry to say were
Mike Hennessy and Johnny Hart&mdash;met
by appointment in a grove near
the farm, and from which to the orchard
a strip of woodland extended,
furnishing a convenient hiding-place,
to accomplish the project.</p>

<p>It never entered their heads that
stealing this fruit was just as much a
theft as to steal one of the farmer's
horses. Nothing could have tempted
one of their number to steal, and
any confectioner in the village might
have spread his most tempting stores
unguarded before them without losing
so much as a comfit; so sacredly
would they have held his right to his
own. But boys have a most perverse
and wicked mode of reasoning
about fruit. They cannot be made to
regard it as the property of the person
who has expended much money
and many years of patient labor to
produce it; and while these boys would
have shuddered at the thought of
purloining the farmer's gold watch
or his silver spoons, which, perhaps,
he would sooner have parted with,
they did not scruple to rob him of
what he had taken infinite pains to
cultivate for his own benefit.</p>

<p>On this occasion our young marauders
had furnished themselves with
bags and baskets, in which to deposit
their plunder; and as the night advanced,
they proceeded through the
woods to the orchard very cautiously,
pausing every few steps to listen if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
any movement was to be heard. As
all was quiet, they hoped the family
in the farm-house were asleep. After
they had gathered most of the pears
and a large portion of the apples,
they were startled by the low growl
of a dog at some distance.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the old chap keeps a
watch-dog?" said Frank. They listened
in perfect silence for some time,
hardly daring to breathe; but hearing
nothing further, set about their task
with renewed energy, and were all
engaged in stowing away the apples,
when suddenly a glare of light from
a large dark-lantern was thrown full
upon the faces of the whole party,
at the same moment revealing the
burly form of farmer Brown, and
his Frenchman, leading a powerful
watch-dog by a chain. At the instant
the farmer turned the light upon
them, he said sternly, "Any boy that
attempts to stir from the spot, I will
let the dog loose after him, and I
warrant he'll be glad to come back in
a hurry!"</p>

<p>The boys needed no such warning.
They were taken so entirely by surprise
that they could not move. The
farmer made a low bow, and said with
mock courtesy,</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you,
young gentlemen, for your kind assistance
in gathering my fruit, though
you selected rather an unseasonable
hour for performing the service. Your
bags and baskets will repay me, however,
for my broken rest. It is a
pity such friendly labors should go
unrewarded, and I shall take pains
to inform your fathers of them to-morrow
morning, that they may bestow
the recompense you have so well
earned."</p>

<p>With that he gathered together the
bags and baskets of fruit, saying,
"Good-night, you young dogs! The
next time you undertake to steal fruit,
I advise you to find out first how
the orchard is guarded, and whether
there's a dog on the premises stronger
and swifter of foot than yourselves!"
and departed.</p>

<p>A more chap-fallen crew than he
left behind him cannot well be imagined!
They started for the village
by the most direct route, as there
was no further need of concealment,
and for a long time the silence of
their rapid homeward march was unbroken.
At length the wrath of
Frank Blair found utterance.</p>

<p>"The mean old hunks! who would
have thought of his keeping that
sneaking Frenchman on guard that
way? If it hadn't been for the dog,
I would have shown fight, and they
shouldn't have carried off the prize
without some broken noses; but I
knew it was no use to pitch into a
fight with that fierce dog against us!
He's an old milksop to depend on a
dog for help."</p>

<p>The boys made no reply, and
Frank saw he had gained no renown
by this adventure. He felt heartily
ashamed of the whole affair, while an
innate sense of justice assured him
and his companions that the farmer
had a right to defend his own property
by any means within his reach.</p>

<p>They all betook themselves to rest
with no enviable feelings. Some of
them, who feared to disturb their families,
were glad to lie on the hay in
the barn.</p>

<p>In the morning they trudged off to
school in good season, with many
gloomy forebodings as to what was
in store for them. About the middle
of the forenoon, Mr. Blair made
his appearance accompanied by the
farmer, and informed the teacher of
the attempt to rob the orchard, and
that he had requested Mr. Brown to
come with him to identify the culprits.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown selected them one by
one, and, as each was pointed out, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
had to rise and take his place in the
middle of the school-room.</p>

<p>When they were all arranged there,
with Frank at their head, Mr. Blair
delivered a sharp reprimand to them,
not failing to intimate that nothing
but future ruin was in store for the
country if Yankee boys allowed themselves
to be drawn into disgraceful
rows and thieving expeditions by
a set of Irish blackguards, and winding
up by severe threats against those
of this company in particular, and all
"foreign scum" in general.</p>

<p>After a short consultation between
the teacher and Mr. Blair, it was announced
that the punishment of the
offenders would be left to Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>The farmer then stated that he
had advised with his wife, and, as he
had been pretty severe upon such
culprits hitherto, without much effect,
they had decided to take another
course now.</p>

<p>"So, young gentlemen," he added,
"she has authorized me to present
her compliments to the school, and
request all but the boys who were
engaged in this transaction to come
with the principal early on Saturday
morning next, to pass the day with
us. I have two boats engaged, with
abundant fishing-tackle, for those who
prefer the water, and fowling-pieces
for the woods, where game is plenty;
so you can take your choice of sports
on land or water. I promise you a
plentiful feast of the fruit which these
youngsters kindly gathered."</p>

<p>The teacher politely accepted the
invitation on behalf of himself and
the scholars, and the farmer, after
again reminding them to come early
in the day, departed with Mr. Blair.</p>

<p>The feelings of the excluded boys
may be imagined, and the teacher
gave them such touching advice in
relation to the enticements and temptations
of boyhood&mdash;speaking like
one who remembered he had himself
been a boy&mdash;that they doubted more
than ever the fun of "tip-top times,"
and the wisdom of following leaders
like Frank Blair.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />

AN UNWELCOME INTRUDER.</h3>

<p>The next morning as the scholars
collected, they found Frank Blair and
several of the excluded boys in the
play-ground, grouped together in close
discussion. When they approached,
Frank called out exultingly,</p>

<p>"I give you fellows joy of your select
party to-morrow! Joe Bundy is
to be one of the company."</p>

<p>This Joe Bundy, whose mother died
in the poor-house some years before,
was a vile, depraved boy, somewhat
older than the subjects of our narrative,
who never came to school, leading
an idle, vagabond life, and so
heartily despised by the boys on account
of his vagrant habits and thievish
propensities that they would have
nothing to do with him. They heard
with great surprise and indignation,
therefore, that he was among the invited
on this occasion, for his character
was well known to the farmer.</p>

<p>In explanation of this singular circumstance,
a fact, not made known
to them until long after these events,
may as well be communicated here.
On the night when our heroes set out
to rob the orchard, it so chanced that
Joe Bundy had entered upon a similar
exploit on his own account, and
was concealed in the grove where he
overheard their conversation, and, suddenly
relinquishing his own plan, hastened
to inform the farmer, the result
of which report has been already related.
Mr. Brown was so well pleased
that he included the informer
among the invited, though he knew
he was a bad boy and disliked by all
the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p>At noon on that day, Joe saw Michael
Hennessy, and called out, "Hallo,
Mike! don't you wish you was
going to the farm with the rest of us?
Such precious fun as we shall have,
and sights of good eating, too! An't
you sorry you can't go?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not!" said Michael; "I
wouldn't go any way, if you were to
be there!"</p>

<p>Joe turned off, muttering something
in a sullen undertone, and casting a
malignant glance at Michael.</p>

<p>At the close of school in the afternoon,
the teacher told the scholars to
meet him at the school-house the next
morning, that they might all set out
together. Bright and early on as fine
a morning as could be desired, did
the merry company gather, with nothing
but the absence of those who
were generally foremost in their frolics,
and the presence of Joe Bundy,
to mar their pleasure.</p>

<p>After a delightful walk, they were
greeted at the farm-house with a hearty
welcome, and found every possible
arrangement made for their enjoyment.</p>

<p>Some betook themselves to the
boats provided with means for fishing.
Others, armed with fowling-pieces,
sought the woods in quest of
partridges, squirrels, and other game
of the season; while a few strolled off
to a sequestered pond, where wild
ducks abounded, and where a small
duck-boat was provided to aid in securing
the spoils.</p>

<p>At the proper time they were summoned
to partake of an excellent dinner;
and so swift had been the flight
of the hours that they could hardly
believe the forenoon was gone. At
the close of a sumptuous feast and
dessert, they were regaled with an
abundant supply of the captured fruit,
to all of which their fine appetites prepared
them to do ample justice.</p>

<p>The whole day was so replete with
mirth, frolic, and sunshine that they
saw the time for their return drawing
near with regret.</p>

<p>When they left, Mrs. Brown distributed
to each a portion of the fruit
for their mothers and sisters, and Mr.
Brown invited them to come again
late in the fall, to gather nuts that
abounded in the woods.</p>

<p>They could talk of nothing on their
way home but the kindness of good
Mr. and Mrs. Brown, and the incidents
and pleasures of the day; the
teacher taking occasion to contrast
such innocent and simple delights
with the wild excitements and lawless
frolics in which boys are too apt to
seek for enjoyment.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

MISFORTUNE AND GRIEF.</h3>

<p>When the scholars assembled on
Monday morning, the first news they
heard was that Mr. Brown's splendid
and valuable watch-dog had been
poisoned, and died on Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown had obtained evidence
so convincing against Michael Hennessy
as to cause his arrest.</p>

<p>Great was the indignation of his
young friends, and unanimous their
declarations that they knew Michael
did not do it.</p>

<p>"A great deal more like that hateful
Joe Bundy," said one.</p>

<p>"Oh! it couldn't be him," said another;
"for he was one of the party,
and of course it wasn't he. If he
hadn't been invited, he might have
done it out of spite; but now he had
no object."</p>

<p>Various were the conjectures and
discussions at school and in the whole
neighborhood.</p>

<p>The trial was on Tuesday, and Mr.
Blair was the prosecuting attorney.
The village apothecary testified that
on the Friday previous Michael Hennessy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
purchased some poison of him,
representing that his mother sent him
for it to poison rats. A neighbor of
Mr. Brown's alleged that he saw Michael
passing his residence in the road
on Saturday afternoon, and Joe Bundy
averred that he saw him prowling
around the farm buildings about the
time indicated by the last witness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hennessy testified that she
sent Michael for the poison to kill
the rats that infested their premises.
Mr. Hennessy said he had mended a
hand-reel for a person who lived just
beyond Mr. Brown's, and sent Michael
home with it on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Blair accepted the evidence of
the parents, and urged the probability
that a portion of the poison had been
reserved by the lad as an instrument
of his spite against Mr. Brown, for
the application of which the errand
upon which he was dispatched furnished
an opportunity.</p>

<p>He set forth every circumstance
unfavorable to poor Michael in the
strongest possible light, blending with
his argument such reflections and assertions
upon the character and training
of the children of foreign parentage
as could not fail to influence a
prejudiced jury.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding an able defence,
the jury, after a short consultation,
returned a verdict of "guilty," and
Michael was sentenced for twelve
months to the reform-school.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the grief and
indignation of his comrades, or the
sympathy of the whole village with
poor Mr. and Mrs. Hennessy. Michael
stoutly protested his innocence,
and there were but very few who
doubted it; but his father, whose
health was very poor and his family
large, was not able to risk an appeal
to a higher court, which would probably,
after all, confirm the decision,
and Mike was not willing to have
him. So they prepared, with heavy
hearts, for the separation.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mrs. Sullivan to
her neighbor Mrs. Mellen&mdash;"indeed,
it's a sore thing to be put upon two
such decent people, through the hatred
of that miserable old Blair against
an Irishman's boy, and him as innocent
as the child in his mother's
arms!"</p>

<p>"You knew them before they came
here, I have heard," said Mrs. Mellen,
who had not lived long in the
place.</p>

<p>"They came over on the vessel
with us, and were from the next county
at home; and this was the way
of it:</p>

<p>"The two brothers, Pat and Mike
Hennessy, married two sisters, Mary
and Bridget Denver. They were decent
tradesmen as any in the two
counties, and were well enough to
do until the hard times came, when
old Ireland saw her poor children
starving on every side so that it would
melt the heart of a stone, or any thing
softer than an English landlord's, to
hear tell of it. Well, in the midst of
the famine, Mike agreed that he'd
come to America, and prepare a place
against Patrick should come with Mary
and Bridget. So when he left them,
Pat set to get all he could together by
selling his bits of furniture and things,
and when times grew worse and worse,
he would not delay, but took Mary
with her baby of a week old, and Bridget,
and came, as I said, on the vessel
with us; and, by the same token, the
ship's name was the Hibernia. A
good name with a rough fortune, like
the dear old land; for the weather
was boisterous from first to last, and
when we had been out four days, the
most awful storm arose, that you'd
think heaven and earth was comin'
together. And in the midst of it
what does poor Bridget do but sicken
and die with the fright, leaving her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
little baby; but it followed its mother
that same night which was God's
blessing on it, poor motherless thing,
seein' it was baptized by a priest we
had on board, and who attended Bridget
at the last.</p>

<p>"When we reached Boston, no tidings
was to be heard of Mike; so
Pat staid there hopin' to get news of
him, and we came on to Vermont,
where Sullivan's sister's husband came
the year before.</p>

<p>"After a while Pat heard that the
vessel Mike sailed on was struck by
an iceberg, and went down with all on
board; and it was called the Polar
Queen, a name no knowledgeable
man would have put on a vessel, in
respect of them same icebergs, that
would naturally enough claim their
own.</p>

<p>"So when Pat heard these news,
and he not finding such work as he
wanted, seein' it was very costly
living in the city, they started for
the West; but hearing at Albany
that the cholera was ragin' there, they
turns and they follows us to Vermont,
thinking, poor creatures! that it would
be some comfort to be near those who
knew of all their troubles. The church
was then a building, and Mr. Wingate
gave him work on it, and has been
the best of friends to him ever since,
and he has never wanted for employment;
but lately his health is poor,
and I'm afeered this grief will kill him
entirely, and indeed my heart is scalded
for them, bein' that we're all as one
family, and their sorrow is our sorrow."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />

AFFLICTED AND CONSOLED.</h3>

<p>When the morning appointed for
the departure of Michael arrived, the
whole school assembled to accompany
him to the depot, and take leave of
him. The teacher gave him much
good advice, and exhorted him to
conform closely to all the rules of the
institution, adding, "And I have no
doubt you will, Michael; for you have
always been a good, attentive, and
obedient scholar."</p>

<p>The parting with his parents and
the children was inexpressibly painful;
but for their sakes he bore up manfully
under it, cheering them with brave
words, and suppressing his grief until
the dear home with all its cherished
associations was no longer in sight.
Oh! how bitterly and dismally did the
heavy grief he had so struggled with,
and tried so heroically to smother,
then press upon him; he still choked
it down until he was ready to suffocate,
and then the weary sense of desolation,
of cruel injustice, and of a homesickness
which made the sight of a
year's separation from all he loved,
that was now staring him in the face,
seem an age of insupportable sorrow,
rushed upon him with overwhelming
power, and found relief in floods of
tears.</p>

<p>The officer who had him in charge
tried to soothe and cheer him; assuring
him that it was a very pleasant
place to which he was going, and that
he would be treated with the utmost
kindness if he behaved well. But what
was the kindness of strangers to the
tenderness of dear parents from whom
he had never before been separated?
What could the place be to him,
though ever so comfortable, to which
he was consigned, in his innocence, as
a disgraced felon?</p>

<p>No! there was no comfort for him!
and again the convulsive sobs shook
his whole frame, and the pride of his
honest Irish heart rebelled against the
injustice of his cruel fate; when suddenly
he remembered the words his
dear mother whispered softly, amidst
sighs and tears, at parting, "Remember,
darling! remember the loving
Jesus! and how he suffered, being innocent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
for our sins. When you are
tempted to despair, fly to the wound
in his sacred heart, ever open to receive
and comfort the broken-hearted,
and you will surely find comfort and
peace." From that moment he became
calm. He sought that dear
refuge, and hid himself there from
the storm that was raging within and
without.</p>

<p>He had always been a warm-hearted
boy, an affectionate, generous, and
dutiful son and brother; but now he
reproached himself that he had never
prized his dear ones at half their value,
or loved them with any thing approaching
to the degree of affection
which they deserved. Oh! if he could
only be with them again, how would
he strive to show his love by the most
entire devotion, and the most diligent
efforts to assist and sustain them.</p>

<p>Then how did the memory of the
wild frolics in which he had joined,
and for which he had even neglected
his religious duties, come back like
accusing spirits to whisper to his afflicted
heart that it was just he should
be punished.</p>

<p>After a few hours' ride, they reached
the place of their destination, and the
principal, a venerable old man with
a most benevolent countenance and
manner, received Michael very kindly,
even tenderly.</p>

<p>With strong efforts the poor lad
was able to maintain his composure
until he prepared for his bed at night,
when the same dark sense of desolation
overwhelmed him, as recollections
of his dear home, and the kneeling
circle, where his place was to be so
long vacant, pressed upon him; but
the thought of how fondly he would
be remembered in their united prayers
this and every other night poured a
ray of light upon his stricken soul.
Again recalling his mother's words, he
knelt by his bedside, commending himself
and all his beloved and afflicted
ones to his Saviour, and to the prayers
of the tender Virgin Mother who
never forsakes her children; and then
slept the peaceful sleep of a tired, exhausted
child on that maternal bosom.</p>

<p>The next morning he was duly instructed
in the routine of his present
position, and soon found that the most
diligent attention to its duties served
to relieve the crushing weight which
seemed to be pressing the very life-blood
from his young heart. After a
few days, he won approving smiles
from the principal, who was as ready
to appreciate the merits of those under
his charge as he was to reprove their
faults.</p>

<p>The Saturday after Michael's arrival,
the devoted bishop of the diocese
visited the institution, and heard the
confessions of the Catholic members.
This was an unspeakable consolation
to Michael; and his heart felt lighter
than he had thought it ever would
again after he had poured the tale of
all its sins and all its sorrows into that
paternal ear. The bishop had obtained
permission for the Catholic boys
to attend mass at their own chapel in
the place, and at his recommendation
they were placed under Michael's care
to and from the church.</p>

<p>Some of these were very wild, reckless
boys, hardened in vice and iniquity,
and disposed to "poke fun" at the
"new prig," as they called Michael.</p>

<p>At first, when he was saying his
prayers, they would shoot peas at him,
flip buttons in his face, and even repeat
portions of prayers in mocking
derision. But he paid no heed to
them. After a few days, two or three
others knelt to their prayers at night
and morning, and then he obtained
permission from the principal to recite
the beads with these at night. It was
not long before they were joined by
every Catholic boy in the dormitory.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful vigor and
tenacity in the life our Catholic Mother&mdash;our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
Mighty Mother, ever ancient,
ever new&mdash;imparts. When, by our own
fault, we seem to have quenched the
last spark of living fire which she
kindled upon the altar of our hearts,
a passing breath from heaven wafted
gently through a fitting word kindly
spoken, or the voice of hymn or prayer
over the dying embers on the almost
abandoned shrine, will awaken the
flame anew, and draw the wanderer
back to the forsaken source of life, of
light, and of warmth.</p>

<p>It was very consoling to Michael to
witness this returning vitality in the
hearts of his unfortunate companions;
and they soon became so fond of him
as to seek his advice and confide all
their troubles to him. The influence
he thus acquired was a great relief
to the principal. It was no longer
necessary for him to exercise unceasing
vigilance over these, who had
been among the most turbulent boys
under his care, to prevent violent outbreaks;
for they were now the most
diligent, attentive, and orderly members
of the establishment.</p>

<p>And Michael's efforts brought their
own reward to himself. The consciousness
of being useful to others
brought cheerfulness to his heart, and
lent new wings to old time, whose
flight had at first been so heavy and
slow; so that at the end of the first
month he was surprised to find how
swiftly it had flown.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER X.<br />

THE DYING PENITENT'S DISCLOSURE.</h3>

<p>There were many sad hearts in the
village of M&mdash;&mdash;, outside of Michael
Hennessy's home, on the day of his
departure. The event cast a gloom
over the whole village; for his bright,
sunny face was a joy to many of its
residents, and there seemed to be a
ray of light stricken out when he departed.</p>

<p>His young companions could no
longer enjoy the sports of the play-ground;
but might be seen gathered
in quiet groups discussing and lamenting
the loss of their joyous comrade.
None mourned for him more than
Frank Blair; for his grief over the absence
of a loved school-mate was increased
by the part his father had
taken in bringing it about. He saw the
time approaching for his own departure,
to take his place in the naval
school, with a sullen apathy that
alarmed his mother and aunt, and
repeatedly expressed his indifference
as to whether he should ever return
to M&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>When Michael had been absent
about two months, Joe Bundy returned
to M&mdash;&mdash; from one of his frequent
distant rambles; and soon after his return
was taken very ill. The physician
pronounced it a very malignant case
of the small-pox, and had him removed
to a building quite out of the village.
He was so generally disliked
that it was difficult to find any one to
take care of him; but when Mrs.
Hennessy heard of it, she offered to
go if Mrs. Sullivan would look after
her house; her oldest daughter, Jane,
being old enough to get along with a
little direction. She accordingly went,
and found him much worse than she
expected, and suffering intensely. As
soon as he saw her, he became so
violently agitated that she thought he
was delirious, and the impression was
confirmed by his pleading in the most
moving terms for her forgiveness, and
that she would send for the priest,
when he had always been a Protestant.
She tried to soothe him; but
he only begged the more earnestly,
and assured her that he was not delirious.
So when the physician came,
she requested him to send Mr. Hennessy
for the priest.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the reverend
father, the young man, to his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
surprise, begged to be admitted into
the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The priest, having satisfied himself
as to his dispositions, and imparted the
necessary instruction, administered
conditional baptism, and then heard
his confession. At its close Joe repeated
a portion to Mrs. Hennessy;
and the fact was then disclosed to her
that he had poisoned the dog and perjured
himself to gratify his anger at
Michael's scornful remark, and his
spiteful feelings toward a boy who was
so generally beloved.</p>

<p>The physician coming in soon after,
the same information was conveyed to
him; and he made no delay in communicating
it to Mr. Hennessy, that
he might act upon it at once.</p>

<p>The news flew like wild-fire through
the village; and great were the rejoicings
on every hand. The school-boys
were frantic with joy; and the
teacher announced that the day of
Michael's return should be celebrated
by a holiday of triumphant exultation
and welcome to their returning friend.</p>

<p>Measures were instituted for Michael's
immediate release; and the
people could hardly await the necessary
course of legal formalities.</p>

<p>Meantime poor Joe grew worse;
and after improving those last few
days of suffering by manifesting such
penitence as the time and the circumstances
would allow, and receiving
from the priest those consolations
which the church extends to penitent
sinners, he died.</p>

<p>Upon examining his few effects, a
roll of counterfeit bills was discovered;
and it was conjectured that his last
journey was made to procure them,
as he had told Mrs. Hennessy that he
supposed he took the small-pox on a
recent visit to Canada.</p>

<p>When the papers were ready, Mr.
Blair claimed the privilege of going
after Michael. He reproached himself
so bitterly for his own injustice
that he could not do enough to manifest
his regret.</p>

<p>A larger crowd was never assembled
in the village than met at the
depot in M&mdash;&mdash; on the evening of
his arrival with his young companion.
They were greeted with joyful cheers,
repeated again and again; and Mr.
Blair led Michael to his father, saying,
"Let me congratulate you, Mr. Hennessy,
on being able to claim such a
son. During the short time he has
been away, among strangers and
under most unfavorable circumstances,
he has established a character
that any young man might envy; and
it was truly touching to witness the
grief of his unfortunate young companions
at parting with him. The
principal also passed the highest encomiums
upon his conduct. Allow
me also to express to this assemblage
of my fellow-townsmen my sincere
regret that I should have had any part
in his unjust conviction, and allowed
myself to be governed by prejudices,
too common in our country, which I
now lay aside for ever. There are
good and bad people among natives
and foreigners; and the man exhibits
but little good sense who passes sweeping
condemnations upon either."</p>

<p>The school-boys, with their teacher
at the head, formed a procession to
escort Michael to his father's house;
and a happier circle was not to be
found in Vermont than the one that
knelt around Mr. Hennessy's family
altar that night, to return fervent
thanksgivings to heaven for having
permitted the separated to be again
and so speedily reunited!</p>

<h2>TEN YEARS IN ROME.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></h2>


<p>Rome, the city of the soul! Who
is there that does not nowadays feel
his thoughts turning almost involuntarily
to the seven-hilled city? To
her many ordinary claims on our
minds, there has of late been added
one of startling interest&mdash;the &OElig;cumenical
Council&mdash;which has not failed
to excite the attention of the world.
It is the daily theme of prayer and of
hope for the devout child of the
church. To the worldling, it is a
theme of curiosity and idle speculation.
To the enemies of the church,
the council is a subject of alarm and
of vague apprehensions. In Europe,
where men curiously mix politics and
religion, their opposition takes the hue
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">odium politicum</i>; and journals, reviews,
and pamphlets are filled with
the most <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outrÃ©</i> accounts of what the
writers assert has been done or will
be done in the council, adverse to
liberty, progress, and civilization. In
America, where as yet men have not
lost the habit of separating politics
from religion, such effusions as these
would be looked on as simply stupid,
unreadable nonsense. Here, however,
as also in England, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">odium
theologicum</i> retains its olden character
and makes use of its olden weapons.
It is worth while to note the apparently
systematic efforts made to repeat
old calumnies, and to coin new
stories after the old pattern, and to
force them on the public attention,
on occasion of this universal interest,
in the evident expectation that they
will now be swallowed as credulously
as they might have been fifty years
ago. No greater tribute, we think,
could be paid to the real advancement
of the public mind than to say
that this expectation has in very great
measure proved vain. There are
things and stories which nowadays
most men instinctively feel to be too
absurd for belief. Hence it is scarcely
worth while to take up such stories
for serious examination. They are
simply to be put in a class together,
and to be properly labelled, and to be
ranked below the sensational tales in
the <cite>Ledger</cite>. This is especially the
case when they appear in organs specially
devoted to the cause which
such stories are intended to support.</p>

<p>Now and then, however, it may be
allowed to dissect such a production,
that the evidence of facts may occasionally
confirm and strengthen the
true instinct which we already possess.
More especially is this allowable,
when the story is peculiarly bold and
prominent, and comes before the
public through a channel in which
we are not prepared to look for an
exhibition of the old and unscrupulous
hatred.</p>

<p>Such an instance has been presented
in several articles in the <cite>Galaxy</cite>, a
monthly periodical published in this
city, and aiming to be a literary and
instructive magazine "of value and
interest."</p>

<p>Among the writers engaged for the
pages of the <cite>Galaxy</cite> is one who is
represented as having been a Roman
Catholic ecclesiastic, and who contributes
a series of articles under the
title, "Ten Years in Rome."</p>

<p>According to these articles, the writer
is an Englishman, and was at one
time a Catholic priest in Rome. He
went to Rome in 1855-56, bearing
letters of introduction, was received
at once into the Propaganda College,
increasing the number of Irish, Scotch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
and English students in that college
to <i>nine</i>, passed from there to the Vatican,
to live "under the same roof
with the pope," became assistant-librarian
to the Congregation of the Index,
and subsequently was the confidential
and trusty secretary of the late
Cardinal d'Andrea, whose private
papers&mdash;or at least some of them&mdash;he
claims still to possess. The <cite>Galaxy</cite>
does not give the name of this writer.
But the daily papers informed us,
some time ago, that a reverend gentleman
of England delivered a lecture
at the lecture-room of Plymouth
Church, Brooklyn, on Rome and its
religion and society; and was qualified
to do so, because he had been
formerly "an official of the Roman
court, secretary to the late Cardinal
d'Andrea, and assistant librarian in
the Index Expurgatorius." The lecturer
was evidently the same individual
as the writer for the <cite>Galaxy</cite>.
The papers gave his name, which, we
are sorry to say, smacks far more of
the Green Island than of England.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that we were
in a position to test at once and fully
the accuracy of these statements in
regard to the past history of the lecturer
and writer; and we reached the
following results:</p>

<p>1. No young English youth or
clergyman of that name ever was received
into the College of the Propaganda
at Rome. This is shown by
the records of the college, and is corroborated
by the assurances of the
present rector, who, in 1855, had been
for several years vice-rector, and has
ever since been connected with the
college, and also by the recollection
of half a dozen Irish and American
students, who were then in the college,
and would have been his companions.</p>

<p>2. During the last twenty-five years
there never was an officer of the Roman
court, or an English or Irish ecclesiastic
connected with it, in any
way, of that name. The list of all
such officers is regularly published
every year. This name has never
figured there. Officers of twenty
years' standing in the Vatican have no
recollection of him. An Englishman
could scarcely have been entirely overlooked.
And at least his brother
Englishmen, who are officers of the
court, would have known and remembered
him.</p>

<p>3. During the same period, no
person of that name has filled the office
of librarian, or assistant-librarian,
of the Index Expurgatorius, or of the
Congregation of the Index. The officials
of that congregation are all Dominicans;
and the writer does not
pretend that he ever joined that order.
We may add the other insignificant
fact, that no such library is known to
exist at all, much less to be so large
as to require the services not only of
a librarian, but of one, perhaps of several,
assistant-librarians.</p>

<p>4. The late Cardinal d'Andrea
never had a secretary of that name.
This is the assurance unanimously
given us by the friends and intimate
acquaintances of the cardinal, and
by the members of his household,
who had lived with him for twenty
years. There can be no doubt on
this fact. We may add one little
item. Cardinal d'Andrea had no
secretary. The <i>secretary</i> of a cardinal
is an ecclesiastic. When a layman is
chosen to fill the place, he is called,
not the <i>secretary</i>, but the <i>chancellor</i> of
the cardinal. Cardinal d'Andrea,
from 1852, when he was made cardinal,
down to his death, employed as
<i>chancellor</i> an estimable and well-educated
gentleman, whom he had known
well, and had been intimately associated
with for years before, and who
still lives in Rome.</p>

<p>5. Although, considering that
forty or fifty thousand strangers visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
Rome every year, it may be possible
that the writer in <cite>The Galaxy</cite> did,
at some time or other, enter that
city, yet we are pretty certain that
he never spent any considerable time
there&mdash;much less, ten years&mdash;as an
ecclesiastic. We have made inquiries
of a number of clergymen, Englishmen
and Irishmen, resident in the
Eternal City for thirty years, who from
their positions must have heard of
such a one, and could not have escaped
becoming acquainted with him under
some circumstances or other. One
after another, they assured us that they
had never met, and could not remember
ever having heard of such, an ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that, in such striking
and important matters of his own
personal history, concerning which he
ought to be perfectly well-informed,
the memory of our lecturer and writer
fails so entirely to agree with the recollection
and knowledge of so many
others. If this is the case here, what
may we look for when he undertakes
to remember what happened to
others?</p>

<p>Our writer makes his bow to the
readers of <cite>The Galaxy</cite> in the number
of December last, in the character of
"<i>Secretary of the late Cardinal d'Andrea</i>,"
concerning whom he gives an
article of nine pages, intended to be
sensational and artistic. He opens
thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The church of San Giovanni in Laterano
was filled with an unusually excited
throng. The magnificent edifice, the pope's
cathedral, as bishop of Rome, was draped
for a funeral. The marble pillars," etc., etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>To be sure, the description of the
edifice which follows is rather misty,
to one who knows it, and some things,
we suspect, are introduced which no
architect ever saw there. But then,
"in the centre of the church," stands
"the chief object of interest," "a gorgeous
catafalque," "entirely covered
with black velvet, very tastefully festooned
with silver." "Escutcheons
were placed at intervals, bearing the
arms of the deceased. On the bier
lay a cardinal's hat, a pastoral staff,
and a mitre. Six gigantic candles of
yellow wax were burning around it."
The pope and the cardinals were to
come to the funeral. As the cardinal-minister
(Antonelli) "stepped from
his carriage" in front of the church,
"there was a deep hum" from the
crowd. For they suspected him of
having compassed the death of the
only cardinal they honored, who was
to be buried that day. "His face
was very pale;" "he played nervously
with the jewelled cross hanging
from his neck." "He could read
his doom in hundreds of scowling
faces; the curses, not loud but deep,
he well interpreted. As he ascended
the steps of the church, a shrill voice
cried out, 'Down with the assassin!'"
"The French guards clinched their
rifles," and "closed in" at a sign to
their captain; and so Cardinal Antonelli
entered the church. After praising
the exquisite requiem mass of Mozart,
with selections from Palestrina,
and the perfect choir of voices, rendering
any instrument superfluous, the
writer places the pope at the head of
the catafalque. "He was visibly
moved." "There was a tremor in
his clear, harmonious voice." "He
whose requiem was being sung had
been a friend and a counsellor."
When at length the services were
over, and the pope and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortÃ©ge</i>
of cardinals had departed, "the people
rushed into the church to render
the only service they could to the departed;
and strong men, unused to
prayer, uttered their fervent <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">requiescat
in pace!</i>"</p>

<p>"This was the funeral of Cardinal
d'Andrea, Abbot of Santa Scolastica,
statesman, politician, and patriot. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
occurred on the 22d day of March
1865."</p>

<p>Now all this may be a very artistic
method of introducing a story. The
chief objection that we have to it is
that the writer makes such a parade
about the funeral of Cardinal d'Andrea.
We think he rather overcharges
the picture. Had it been any body
else's funeral, we might possibly let it
pass. But in the case of this cardinal,
we object; for, to our own knowledge,
on this 22d day of March, 1865, Cardinal
d'Andrea was not lying dead
on that bier in San Giovanni in Laterano,
as described, but, on the contrary,
was alive, if not perfectly well,
in Sorrento, near Naples, whither he
had gone over nine months before for
his health. Nor did he die about this
time; but he lived on, and wrote
some letters from time to time, which
were published in the papers, and one,
if not several, pamphlets, which were
very acceptable to editors in Italy and
France, in quest of themes for their
leading articles. As late as the autumn
of 1867, the papers were discussing
what step Cardinal d'Andrea
would next take. And they chronicled
his return to Rome in December,
1867. Yes, we decidedly object. We
do not think that this writer, however
extraordinary his powers of memory
may be, has a right to bury Cardinal
d'Andrea alive, to say nothing of
bringing the venerable pontiff to grief,
of frightening Cardinal Antonelli, of
making the French guards clinch
their rifles and go through a military
man&oelig;uvre, and, last of all, of so terribly
exciting a Roman crowd about
the death of one who had not died
at all.</p>

<p>Having commenced the performance
by this <i>tour de force</i> before his
public, our "secretary of the late Cardinal
d'Andrea," like a skilful actor
as he is, jumps a somersault backward
two years and a half, (carrying
us to about September, 1862,) and
undertakes to give us some inkling of
how Cardinal d'Andrea and Cardinal
Antonelli came to be opposed to each
other. There was a plan entered
into by several cardinals and monsignori
to induce the pope to recommend
Cardinal Antonelli to resign his office
as Cardinal-Minister and Secretary of
State. The "secretary" omits to
inform us distinctly whether Cardinal
d'Andrea was a party to the plan or
not. But we are left to infer that he
was. It failed. And ever after, Cardinal
d'Andrea did not enjoy the confidence
of the pope to the degree he
had done before; and Cardinal Antonelli
and his followers hated him.
The <i>recollection</i> of this intrigue, and
its failure, is followed by an exposition
of the political sentiments of the cardinal.
"He became the leader of the
liberal policy of Cavour, in Rome."</p>

<p>Now, here again we object. That
a number of cardinals or monsignori
should think that it would be well if
a cardinal secretary of state, for the
time being, should resign; and that
affairs would be better managed, if
another incumbent filled the place, is
possible; perhaps, considering the variety
of opinions among men, is not
improbable. In the case of Cardinal
Antonelli, the matter is complicated,
perhaps we should say, simplified, by
the fact that they would find very few
indeed to agree with them. But that
a number of cardinals and monsignori
did really entertain such an opinion
on the subject, and did, in September,
1862, or thereabouts, combine in an
effort to oust Cardinal Antonelli, is
vouched for, so far as we know, only
by the recollections of our writer. The
plan itself was not dreamed of in well-informed
circles in Rome, and the
bold and adroit measures by which
Cardinal Antonelli is said to have
foiled it failed to attract attention at
the time, or to leave any trace afterward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
either in the diplomatic records
of Rome, or in the memory of any
one else besides our writer. It is one
other additional instance of the perversity
of the world, which will not
remember what he recalls so distinctly.</p>

<p>As to Cardinal d'Andrea, he had
been, since 1860, Cardinal-Bishop of
Sabina, and was also Prefect of the
Congregation of the Index. His
health had begun to fail some time
before the date we are examining, and
within a few months afterward he was
forced, much to the regret of the pope,
to resign the latter office, and to restrict
himself to the duties of his diocese
and his private affairs, and could
take but a light share in the work of
a cardinal. To make him at that
time a prime mover in the scheme, is
as gratuitous as, under the circumstances,
it is absurd.</p>

<p>The statement of his political principles
is equally in contradiction with
facts. Cardinal d'Andrea had all his
life been a most strenuous and active
supporter of the temporal power of the
pope, and was not a man to change
his position and his principles at the
close of his life. He was as uncompromising,
and a far more outspoken
opponent of the policy of Cavour,
than even Cardinal Antonelli himself,
who, as befits his office and his character,
never violates the reserved and
strictly temperate expressions allowed
by diplomatic courtesy. All that our
writer "remembers" concerning Cardinal
d'Andrea's connection with and
influence over the Roman committee,
is a pure effort of his memory, which,
by the by, on this point has played
him false. He remembers, "To his
counsel it was due that no revolt occurred
on the withdrawal of the
French." Why, the French troops
were withdrawn from Rome in December,
1866, to be sent back in October,
1867, on the occasion of Garibaldi's
attempted invasion of the Papal
States. How could Cardinal
d'Andrea, who had died, as the secretary
"remembers," and whose funeral
obsequies had been so pompously
celebrated in the cathedral church of
San Giovanni di Laterano, on the 22d
day of March, 1865, be alive to give
counsel and use his influence with the
Mazzinians and the party of action a
year and nine months afterward? Has
the writer's own memory proved traitor
to him, and joined the crowd of
contradictors?</p>

<p>In point of fact, Cardinal d'Andrea
was not in Rome in December,
1866, nor for months before and for
months afterward. He was at Naples,
or its neighborhood, seeking to
restore his shattered and sinking
health.</p>

<p>Our secretary takes a second leap
backward, and "endeavors to give
a slight sketch of the Cardinal d'Andrea,
necessarily imperfect as pen and
ink sketches always are." The incompleteness
we might readily excuse.
But we cannot excuse its utter incorrectness
in the details, an incorrectness
so unnecessarily excessive that
we can only explain it on the theory
he is entirely guided by that wonderful
memory, of the powers of which
we have had such evidences. Especially
is this seen when, leaving generalities
aside, the writer ventures to
make a precise and definite statement.</p>

<p>Thus, we are informed that, in his
early life, the cardinal "had been bred
for the army, and served in the Noble
Guard for three years." Whereas the
cardinal was not born in Rome or
the Roman States at all, and never
had any connection whatever with
the Noble Guard or any other military
corps. He was born in Naples.
His father, the Marquis Giovanni
d'Andrea, was treasurer of the kingdom
of Naples. His elder brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
the present Marquis d'Andrea, is still
living near Naples. Jerome d'Andrea,
the future cardinal, at an early
age showed an inclination for the
church, and in due time went through
the ordinary course of ecclesiastical
studies. At its conclusion, he came
to Rome, and entered the Accademia
Ecclesiastica, a college for the higher
and more thorough education of such
ecclesiastics as wish to enter the <i>carriera</i>,
as it is called, that is, who aspire
to become ecclesiastical officials
at Rome. There was nothing military
about the cardinal. He simply
had the dignified bearing and the
polished manners of an Italian nobleman.</p>

<p>"He viewed the Jesuits as the foes
of reform; his scheme was to destroy
their influence in the public schools."
"The mendicant orders met no favor
with him." "He did approve of the
dissolution of <em>their</em> monasteries." This
posthumous revelation of the cardinal's
sentiments will undoubtedly astonish
the Jesuits and the mendicant
orders at Rome, if they ever hear of
it, unless indeed they are foolish
enough to trust their own memory of
the words and acts of the cardinal in
life, rather than the wonderful memory
of this "secretary." The Jesuits will
remember how often and regularly he
would visit their father-general, or
Father Perrone, or the more illustrious
and learned members of their
society; how fond he was of having
some of them to visit him frequently;
how he would invite their counsel and
aid, and how he was careful to omit
no proper occasion of publicly showing
his friendship and esteem for them.
The members of the mendicant orders
will call to mind their perpetual intercourse
with one who was always a
kind father to them. As one of the
cardinal's household expressed it to
us, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Era sempre attorniato da lore</span>&mdash;He
always had these friars around him</i>.
We fear that, with such cherished
memories in their hearts, they will
pay very little regard to the recollections
of our "secretary."</p>

<p>But he becomes more precise in the
details of the cardinal's daily life.</p>

<p>"The cardinal generally rose at six,
and spent three hours in reading ere
he said mass and breakfasted. He
then received, and at twelve rode out,
except when his presence was required
by the pope. The afternoon was spent
in a siesta until six. At half-past nine
he retired."</p>

<p>What a sleepy-head this affectionate
and reverential "secretary" would
make the cardinal to be. Retire at
half-past nine, and rise at six. Here
we have eight hours for a good night's
sleep; ample allowance, one would
think. But no. Each day, after his
noon-day drive, the afternoon until six
is spent in a siesta; that is, at least
four hours more given to sleep&mdash;twelve
hours, on an average, out of
every twenty-four! And this was the
ordinary course of things, only interrupted
when his presence was required
by the pope! Was he in any way related
to Rip Van Winkle, or is it the
secretary who is dreaming? Certainly
Cardinal d'Andrea bore all his
life the reputation of being a remarkably
wide-awake, clear-headed, and
active business man.</p>

<p>We presume that he usually rose
about six&mdash;a little later in winter,
somewhat earlier in summer&mdash;such
being the custom of Italians of his
standing. By half-past eight, mass
and breakfast were over; for business
hours commence at nine, and the cardinal
gave the forenoon to business,
whether in the consistories or in the
meetings of congregations or at his
own residence, where secretaries, theologians,
and other officials, and all interested
parties, would see him. At
half-past one, or at two, as business
allowed, he dined. In summer, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
took a siesta for half an hour or so.
An hour or more was given to reciting
his breviary and to private study.
At four in winter and five in summer,
if the weather allowed, he would drive
out, and when outside the city might
indulge in half an hour's active walk
on foot. ReÃ«ntering his carriage, he
reached home about sunset. Until
nine, he received those who called
on him, whether on business or as
friends. Then came his supper, after
which he loved to spend an hour
or two in lively conversation on the
topics of the day with his more intimate
and esteemed friends. About
eleven, he usually retired to rest; but,
too frequently for his health, he would,
if he had what he deemed important
business on hand, stay up until one or
two in the morning, studying or writing.</p>

<p>"In his meals he was sparing, attached
to the French <i>cuisine</i>, and
drank the light native vintage of
Monte Fiascone.... He never went
among French society. He gave
the French no countenance, regarding
them as witnesses of his country's
serfdom."</p>

<p>What the writer means by this last
phrase, or how the English and Germans
visiting Rome are not as truly
witnesses to things there as the French
can be, we do not understand, and
shall not stop to inquire. The important
statements are before us.
The cardinal was attached to the
French <i>cuisine</i> and avoided French
<i>society</i>. Now, the truth was just the
reverse on both these points. The
cardinal was an excellent linguist and
a well-read scholar. He delighted in
the company of educated Frenchmen,
ecclesiastics, laymen, and military, and
was quite intimate with many of them.
But as to his food, he remained a true
Neapolitan to the day of his death,
and stuck to macaroni, vermicelli,
and pollenta, as an Englishman sticks
to his roast beef and good mutton.</p>

<p>"The Cardinal d'Andrea was fond
of theatricals; indeed, private representations
were among the few enjoyments
he had. He relished them
amazingly."</p>

<p>When we repeated this statement
to the member of the cardinal's household
to whom we are indebted for our
information on the preceding points,
he turned on us a look of bewildered
astonishment which we shall not soon
forget. "<i>Poesie! poesie!</i>" he exclaimed.
"<i>All an invention; all an invention.</i>"</p>

<p>Even in his early life, when, as a
layman, he could have frequented the
theatre without any breach of decorum,
he had avoided it. As a clergyman,
of course he could not go
without losing caste. It might have
well happened that, in his travels in
France, Switzerland, Germany, and
various parts of Italy, he had at some
time or other chanced to be a guest
where courtesy called on him to be
present at private theatricals held in
the family. Of this our informant
could not speak, for he had not always
been with him on these journeys.
But since he had been made
cardinal he had been with him, and
could not recall a single instance
where the cardinal had attended such
a private representation. In his own
palace he could not have had them.
His own character did not run in that
line of amusement; and even if he had
desired it, the size and form of the
apartments would have rendered them
impossible.</p>

<p>But such effusions of our "secretary's"
poetic or inventive memory
are of themselves too slight and trivial
to merit a place in <cite>The Galaxy</cite>. There
must be something of graver import
to come. And in fact these things
have only been the preliminaries for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
the grand events which are to be recorded
of Cardinal d'Andrea; his escape
from Rome by the active aid of
this secretary; the espionage over his
words and acts when he returned&mdash;an
espionage which this secretary detected,
though he could not foil it; the
finding of the cardinal unexpectedly
and mysteriously dead in his bed one
morning; and finally, the saving of
his important private papers, by this
secretary, from the clutches of Cardinal
Antonelli&mdash;papers which he has
persistently guarded and still retains,
and which hereafter, we may be allowed
to conjecture, can serve to
refresh and stimulate his wondrous
powers of memory, if any stimulation
be needed.</p>

<p>The scene opens some time during
the course of those two years, to the
beginning of which the first jump
backward brought our writer. The
plan to oust Cardinal Antonelli from
office had been formed, as we were
told, and failed; and Cardinal d'Andrea
had lost somewhat of the pope's
favor, and had incurred the bitter enmity
of Cardinal Antonelli and of the
Jesuits and ultramontanes. We may
reasonably allow some months for so
much. When time had brought things
to this pass, "there was a party in the
Piazza di Spagna, given by a Russian
princess, at which the <i>Ã©lite</i> of Roman society
was assembled. Among the guests
was Cardinal d'Andrea. Madame
C&mdash;&mdash;, the wife of Captain C&mdash;&mdash;,
of the French army, was, as usual, coquetting
with the Cardinal di C&mdash;&mdash;a,
a prince of the most ancient of Roman
houses, with one of the finest palaces
in Rome." The secretary loiters to
describe Captain C&mdash;&mdash;, of the French
army, and Madame C&mdash;&mdash;, his young
and handsome wife, and to tell his
readers of her notorious intrigue with
the above-named Cardinal Prince di
C&mdash;&mdash;a, of the ancient family and
with the fine palace. "Four days
after this party, Captain C&mdash;&mdash; appeared
at his wife's apartments. He
was cool and deliberate. He upbraided
her in unmeasured terms.
She bitterly resented.... His rage
became terrible. Ere she could utter
a prayer or a cry, he seized the miserable
woman and shot her; then shot
himself! The affair created some little
sensation."</p>

<p>We should think it would, especially
in peaceful, slow-going, decorous
Rome. Even in New-York, or
in London, or in Paris, such a tragedy,
in which persons of that social
standing were concerned, would have
created quite a sensation.</p>

<p>The Prince di C&mdash;&mdash;a, "of one of
the most ancient of Roman houses,
with one of the finest palaces in
Rome," can of course be none other
than the Prince <i>Colonna</i>. The Roman
princes are few in number, and
can easily be counted. No other has
a surname to suit. The ancient family
and the fine palace are earmarks also.
He means <i>Colonna</i>. But then, many,
many years have passed since there
was a cardinal of that family. In fact,
take the list of cardinals since 1850,
and the only one whose name the
designation C&mdash;&mdash;a could fit is Cardinal
Cuesta, a Spaniard, who at the
date of this party, (somewhere, if we
follow the "secretary," in the winter
of 1862-63,) was an aged septuagenarian
bishop, zealously ruling his
diocese in Spain; moreover, he was
not then a cardinal. He was made
cardinal two years afterward. Furthermore,
he resides not in Rome but
in Spain, whence he was lately called
to Rome for the present council. He
obviously cannot be the man. And
so the Cardinal Prince di C&mdash;&mdash;a
vanishes into thin air, like a poetic
phantom, as he is.</p>

<p>Captain C&mdash;&mdash;, of the French army,
and his wife, Madame C&mdash;&mdash;, seem disposed
to follow him into empty space.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
No French officer then in Rome, and
we have consulted several, can remember
any French captain who killed his
wife and then committed suicide. The
police never got wind of the double
tragedy. It escaped even the keen-scented
newspaper itemizers. The
"little sensation" is a feat of memory.</p>

<p>Decidedly our "secretary" is as
unlucky at tragedies as he is at funerals,
even though he assures us
"the incidents of that reunion have
fixed themselves very much on my
memory, for it was the last time the
Cardinal d'Andrea appeared at such
assemblies." In fact, he proceeds to
narrate how that very night, by his
skilful planning, the cardinal was able
to get out of Rome. This gives us,
for the first time, we may say, in this
article, the slightest soundings of
truth. Cardinal d'Andrea did once
leave Rome for Naples without the
regular permission which was required
for one in his position. We will speak
further on of the motives and circumstances
of that departure. Here we
will only state the fact, that he left
Rome on the 16th of June, 1864.
The writer of this article was in Rome
at the time, and, for peculiar reasons,
no such tragedy as that "remembered"
and the sensation it created
could have escaped his knowledge.
We may add that in Rome such parties
are given in winter and never
in summer. The strangers who visit
Rome in winter, and leave after Easter,
are in June in Switzerland or some
other cool place. As for the <i>Ã©lite</i> of
Roman society, they are "out of
town."</p>

<p>But let us leave facts aside, and
enter on that dream-land, the incidents
of which are so firmly fixed on
the memory of our secretary. Hear
him:</p>

<p>"The cardinal retired early, and, it
being moonlight and very fine, resolved
to send back the carriage and walk
home. He walked in company with
his secretary, a servant, as usual, attending
at a little distance. He had
passed into the Corso, when a man
suddenly started out of the small and
dark Via Fontanella di Borghese....
It was a celebrated politician, who
dared not have open intercourse with
any one for fear of compromising
them, and he conveyed the unwelcome
intelligence that the cardinal's
life was in imminent danger....
Every moment was of importance.
A plan was speedily devised. The
Honorable Mr. K&mdash;&mdash; was leaving
at two o'clock in his private carriage
for Civita Vecchia, to catch the French
steamer touching at Civita Vecchia
at half-past twelve next day, on her
way to Naples." The secretary disguised
himself, and stealthily sought
an interview at once with this Englishman
bearing an American title,
and briefly "told his errand." "The
generous Englishman proposed that
the cardinal should accompany him,
disguised as a friend whose name appeared
in his passport. The friend,
on being consulted, agreed, and the
secretary left, promising to be ready
at a certain street with the cardinal,
where the carriage was to take him
up.... His eminence put on the
beard and moustache our English
friend had given us, and, with the aid
of a large Inverness cape and white
wide-awake, was splendidly disguised.
It wanted two hours and a half of
the time. The cardinal never lost
his presence of mind, but was gloomy
and foreboding. At last we called
the valet, devoted to his master, and
informed him of the plan. He was
to pretend illness on the part of the
cardinal. He listened carefully to his
instructions, and exclaimed, 'Eminence,
your shoes and stockings!'
We looked down, and saw that the
patent-leather, low, clerical shoes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
gold buckles and the red silk stockings
were very obvious betrayals of
the rank of the disguised. No lay
shoes and stockings were at hand,
until the valet bethought him of his
own. Hastily effecting the change,
the cardinal passed out of the place
alone, not suffering any one to accompany
him." Whereby, we presume,
he ran some risk of blundering as to
the appointment, and moreover forced
the zealous secretary to break his promise
of being "ready at a certain street
with the cardinal, where the carriage
was to take him up." "The whole of
the next day passed heavily, but no
inquiries were made for his eminence.
As his valet only waited on him, the
other domestics easily believed that
he was indisposed. Two days after,
the secretary hastily scanned the <cite>Giornale
di Roma</cite>, where he saw the departure
of Mr. K&mdash;&mdash; announced,
and that of his friend. The valet,
poor fellow, though somewhat obese
and awkward, executed an eccentric
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas seul</i>, in token of his satisfaction
at the news, and then broke out into
a fervent <i>Ave Maria</i> for his master's
safety. Four days elapsed, and a
summons came to attend the consistory.
Then it was announced that
the cardinal had left for Naples."</p>

<p>Now, we confess to having enjoyed
this passage of our "secretary's" <i>reminiscence</i>
more than any other. We
think it his best effort. Still, it lacks
some touches. He should not have
omitted the matter of the exchange
of the cardinal's knee-breeches for the
valet's pantaloons. For obviously, if
the cardinal put on the lay shoes and
stockings of the valet, and retained
his own knee-breeches, a space of ten
inches at least on each leg would
necessarily have been left bare and
uncovered. Such an arrangement,
however conducive to coolness, would
have been a very remarkable feature
of his costume, especially noticeable
in contrast with the large Inverness
cape which warmly enveloped the
upper part of his person, and that in
the month of June. Such an outfit
would certainly attract every eye.
Surely the cardinal and the valet
must have then and there exchanged
the knee-breeches of the one against
the pantaloons of the other, regardless
of how they fitted. Again, the "secretary"
ought to have given us some
inkling of how the valet felt and demeaned
himself next morning when
he appeared before his fellow-servants
rigged out in the patent-leather,
low, clerical shoes with gold
buckles, the red silk stockings, and
the knee-breeches of his master, instead
of his own proper habiliments.
Could not our secretary have adorned
the <cite>Galaxy</cite> with some of the brilliant
things then said and done?</p>

<p>The Honorable Mr. K&mdash;&mdash;, too,
acted very strangely. He might have
taken his rest like a sensible man that
night, and have left Rome by the
accommodation train starting at six
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> next morning, reaching Civita
Vecchia at nine; or he might have
waited for the express train, starting at
ten <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, reaching Civita Vecchia at
twelve, and making connection with
the steamers, whether bound to Naples
or to Leghorn or to Marseilles. But
no. He must lose his night's rest,
and start at two <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> in a private carriage
to travel fifty miles, and reach
a French steamer touching at Civita
Vecchia at half-past twelve.</p>

<p>But if our secretary, in his recollections,
can spurn facts, it would be
superfluous to ask him to respect
mere probabilities.</p>

<p>The real method of the cardinal's
departure from Rome and his journey
to Naples was the following very
prosaic one:</p>

<p>On the 16th of June, 1864, he drove
in his own carriage from his own residence,
the Palazzo Gabrielli, to the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
station in Rome, and took a ticket
for Velletri, to which city he was
accustomed to go, from time to time,
to attend to the interests of the estate
Girgenti, of which the family had requested
him to become the administrator
during the minority of the
heirs. His valet alone accompanied
him. The carriage was ordered to
be at the station in the afternoon, as
he might come back by the returning
train. At Velletri, the cardinal was
met by his man of business in that
city, who had possibly made the necessary
arrangements, and both proceeded
in the same train to Isoletta, on
the Neapolitan frontier. The cardinal
continued on to Naples. The agent
came back to Rome, found the carriage
at the station, rode in it to the
Palazzo Gabrielli, and informed the
cardinal's chancellor and the household
that the cardinal had gone to
Naples for his health, and was not
able to say when he would return.</p>

<p>This is the plain, matter-of-fact occurrence
which the secretary's memory
has changed into something like a
chapter from one of Mrs. Radcliffe's
novels sixty years ago.</p>

<p>We have already said that Cardinal
d'Andrea took this step without the
permission which, according to the
rules of the Sacred College, he should
have previously obtained. He had
asked for that permission, and it had
not been granted. When he publicly
violated the rule on this point, the
Italian enemies of the temporal
power of the pope hoped that they
had unexpectedly found a cardinal in
such a position that they might, by
degrees, make him their tool, and use
him against Pius IX. Voices were
heard hinting that it might be proper
even to make him an anti-pope. The
wiser ones among them saw from the
beginning how absurd such hopes and
plans were; for they knew the past
history and the real character of the
cardinal; and they rightly judged that
whatever might be the motives of his
present unexpected and most unusual
proceeding, they must be personal.
The step could not spring from any
policy opposed to that of the court of
Rome. They knew too well that he
had always been a strenuous defender
of the pope; they had often found
him their active and energetic opponent.
Later events proved to all
that this judgment of theirs was correct.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the birth and
early education of Girolamo d'Andrea,
and his coming to Rome and
entrance into the Accademia Ecclesiastica
in that city. Soon after
finishing his course of studies there
with considerable reputation, he was
made, in 1841, <i>ponente</i>, or judge, in
an inferior ecclesiastical court, commencing
thus his <i>carriera</i> at the bottom,
but with distinction. He was
afterward (1843) made delegate, or
governor, of the province of Viterbo;
and three years later went as nuncio
or ambassador to Lucerne in Switzerland,
which office he filled at the time
of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sonderbund</i> war. Toward 1849,
he returned to Rome, and was elevated
to the very responsible position
of Secretary of the Congregation of
the Council. When Pius IX., after
the public assassination of his prime-minister,
Rossi, and the threats of violence
to himself, escaped to Gaeta,
Monsignor d'Andrea of course followed
him. He was the prominent
and most active man in reÃ«stablishing
the papal government in Umbria and
the Marches and the patrimony. After
two years of successful labor, he returned
to Rome, to receive the thanks
and the reward due to a delicate task
zealously and satisfactorily accomplished.
He was still Secretary of the
Congregation of the Council, one of
the highest posts he could hold, without
being cardinal. On the 15th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
March, he was made cardinal-priest,
with the title of <cite>Sant' Agnese fuori delle
Mura</cite>. He had thus, in eleven years,
reached the highest step of the Roman
<i>carriera</i>. All acknowledged,
even those whom he had passed,
that the cardinal's hat was, in this case,
most fittingly bestowed on learning,
talents, experience, and as the well-deserved
reward of zealous and efficient
services. The new cardinal was
soon named Prefect of the Congregation
of the Index and Abbate Commendatario
of Santa Scolastica, which
last title he retained to his death. In
1860, he became Cardinal-Bishop of
Sabina; and, by the firm and wise administration
of his diocese, was looked
on as a model bishop. In 1862, his
health began to fail. Slow fevers
seemed to undermine his constitution,
stronger in appearance than in reality.
At times a racking cough and a copious
expectoration harassed him,
and he seemed sinking into consumption.
Rallying from this, he would
suffer excruciating pains in the intestines;
and, at times, he was subject
to fainting fits. Still he struggled
against all this, and kept on at his
work. His friends noticed that he
gradually became more silent and despondent.
They observed, too, another
effect of this long-continued indisposition.
He became inclined to
take up fixed ideas, and, perhaps, crotchets,
and to adhere to them the more
tenaciously if opposed. He evidently
was not, at all times, the man he
had formerly been. Of course, it took
time for all this to be suspected and
reluctantly admitted.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1864, the cardinal
took up the idea that his health would
be restored if he went to Naples, his
birth-place. He asked permission to
do so.</p>

<p>Special circumstances made the request
one to be considered very maturely.
The government at Rome
was in a critical and delicate position,
which required it to avoid most carefully
any step capable of a doubtful interpretation,
or liable to be made a pretext
for certain false charges then current
against it. The ex-king of Naples
was a refugee in Rome. Dethroned
sovereigns generally seek and find an
asylum there. His friends and adherents
in Naples were busy concerting
measures to get him back on his
throne. The Italian government and
the Italian papers charged the court
with assenting to and aiding in these
plans. Even France seemed to be
growing cold, and to be manifesting
those dispositions which, a few months
after, culminated in the iniquitous convention
with Victor Emmanuel for
the withdrawal of the French troops
from the duty of protecting Rome.
All these things made the court of
Rome trebly cautious to commit no
mistake.</p>

<p>It was felt that for a Roman cardinal
to go then to Naples, even under
the pretext of ill-health, more especially
a cardinal like Cardinal d'Andrea,
whose family had been for several generations
closely connected with the
dethroned royal family, and whose
personal antecedents had been those
we have recited, would be too dangerous.
No explanations, however sincere,
no disavowals, however explicit,
could silence the charges or avert the
troubles that might follow. Hence
the permission asked for was refused,
the more readily as the idea was looked
on as the cardinal's own fancy, and
was not based upon the advice of
physicians. The pope himself explained
the matter to the cardinal, and
offered him permission to go to Malta,
to Spain, to Pau, in France, to
Nice, in Savoy, or anywhere else that
the physicians would advise, or he
desire. But to Naples, under the circumstances,
it would not do for him
to go. The cardinal seemed to assent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
at the moment, and to acquiesce
in the decision. But, some time
after, he returned to the fixed idea,
repeated his request, waited some
weeks, and, not receiving any reply,
started on the 16th of June, 1864,
without permission, and, in the manner
we have stated, went to Naples.
At first, he spent several months, perhaps
a year, at Sorrento, well known
to all who visit southern Italy for
their health. After some time, he
moved to the city of Naples itself, and
lived there until his return to Rome.</p>

<p>Concerning the cardinal's stay in
Naples, our "secretary" remembers
only two points: "He was located in
ill-furnished lodgings on the Chiaja, at
Naples, sorely distressed for money.
More than this, his good name was
suffering"&mdash;suffering, he means, in the
opinion of the Mazzinians, the followers
of the policy of Cavour and "the
party of action." The Roman Committee
seems to have been particularly
exercised in reference to him.</p>

<p>Now as to the money matters. In
Naples the cardinal kept a suite of
apartments in the HÃ´tel Crocelles,
one of the best in that city. Moreover,
he also kept up his full establishment
in the Palazzo Gabrielli, in
Rome. He paid every body and
every thing punctually; as, indeed,
he might well do, considering the position
of his family and his own private
resources. If his health failed,
his purse did not&mdash;which is more than
can be said of most men, be they
laymen, ecclesiastics, or even cardinals.
When he died, his will gave
legacies to friends and servants, and
to religious and charitable purposes,
and returned something to his family.</p>

<p>As to the second point, undoubtedly
the cardinal's good name did suffer.
The step he had taken was public;
and the newspapers, after their style,
had not failed to herald it over the
world as something striking and important,
from which, perhaps, vast results
would follow. Catholics everywhere
were pained that a cardinal
should take so false a step, and place
himself in a position apparently so
equivocal; perhaps, too, some apprehended
ulterior and more painful results.
On the other hand, the Italianissimi
waited, and cajoled him, and
hoped. But when he had been away
from Rome more than two years, and
they found that they were not succeeding,
as they desired, in making
him their tool, they commenced to
depreciate and ridicule him. This
last point we rather think to his credit.</p>

<p>The mode of Cardinal d'Andrea's
departure from Rome naturally set all
Rome a-talking. His friends tried to
explain and to excuse it in the mode
we have stated. The excuse was
probably felt to have some force.
Anyhow, it was evident that the
mode of his departure prevented the
court of Rome from being compromised
by his presence in Naples.
Time and patience are held to be
golden remedies at Rome. No official
notice was taken of Cardinal
d'Andrea's absence. True, friends
and counsellors and his brother cardinals
wrote to him privately, remonstrating
with him and urgently advising
him to return without delay. Had
he listened to them, and returned
within any reasonable time, we are
satisfied no notice would have been
taken of the affair, and the whole
matter would have dropped into oblivion.</p>

<p>But when he had been away two
years, it was felt that some official
steps must be taken. Accordingly,
the cardinal dean wrote him officially,
rehearsing the law of the church
about the residence of bishops, warning
him that he had now been too
long absent without permission, and
inviting him to return. Thrice the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
monition was given, as required, and
given without effect. The diocese
of Sabina was consequently withdrawn
from his charges and confided
to an administrator <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad interim</i>, until
other provisions should be made in
regard to it. Still the cardinal declined
or delayed to come. Other
official letters warned him of possible
further consequences, even to ejectment
from his dignity as cardinal.
His friends, also, renewed their private
remonstrances and entreaties
more urgently than ever. And, finally,
on the evening of December 14th,
1867, Cardinal d'Andrea returned to
Rome.</p>

<p>Three days later, he had an audience
of the holy father, from which
he returned to his palace in a very
cheerful mood, and spoke to his attendants
of the kindness of the pope,
and declared that every thing had
passed off most satisfactorily.</p>

<p>His long stay in Naples had not benefited
his health. He still coughed,
and still, at times, had severe crises of
pain in the abdomen. But he was
able in some measure to take up the
ordinary work of a cardinal. The
charge of the diocese was not restored
to him; time was required for that.
Rome is slow to act, and slow to undo
what has been legally done.</p>

<p>After having fatigued our readers
by this long stretch over humdrum realities,
it may be well to seek a little
relief in some more of the wondrous
feats of the wondrous memory of "the
secretary of the late Cardinal d'Andrea."</p>

<p>He does not remember that audience
at all. Nay, he remembers that
there was none. "Daily," after his
return, the cardinal "expected a summons
to the presence of the pope.
Then he resolved to assert his right
to an audience, and repaired to the
Vatican. He was informed that all
his communications to the pope were
to pass through the hands of the cardinal
secretary. To sue to his worst
foe&mdash;this was the climax of bitterness.
The high spirit of his eminence never
recovered this indignity. The holy
father was all this time informed that
the cardinal had returned; but was
recusant, and refused all overtures of
reconciliation. After his last repulse,
the cardinal made no further efforts;
but it was easy to see that he suffered
acutely."</p>

<p>All bosh! The "secretary" might
have ascertained that the papers of
the day announced the return of the
cardinal to Rome and his audience;
for the cardinal was then a notoriety.
But he is strong on his powers of memory;
or, perhaps, as he had killed
the cardinal and buried him, as we
saw, two years and nine months before
this&mdash;in March, 1865&mdash;he now
ran his eye over a file previous to that
date; and, as the papers were published
while the cardinal was at Sorrento,
there was no mention then of
an audience. But we are loth to believe
the "secretary" has even that
little regard for what others remember
which would make him think it
at all necessary to look even at a file
of newspapers either for dates or facts.</p>

<p>But he gives us, in lieu, an exquisite
production of his own memory.</p>

<p>"The cardinal's enemies," he tells
us, "were far too wary to resort to
open acts." They remained so quiet
that all suspicion was lulled to rest,
except in the cardinal and his secretary.
"It is remarkable that we sometimes
find an idea dart suddenly into
the mind without cause or ramification."(!!)
... This was the case
with the secretary, probably also with
the cardinal. The idea took this
shape: "The favorite mode of obtaining
secret information in Rome is by
eaves-dropping and espionage. This
palace has been for two months at the
bidding of those who knew the cardinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
would return to it. They are
anxious to know all he says and does;
if possible, all he thinks. They will
study the revelations of his countenance
in moments of <i>abandon</i>. And
if they have designs"&mdash;here the idea
seemed going into extravagance. We
decidedly agree with him; we even
think the idea shows signs of <i>ramification</i>.</p>

<p>One <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piÃ¨ce</i> of the cardinal's apartments
was a breakfast-room, in which
there hung a picture of St. Francis
meditating. "I was reading in that
room; and the twilight had deepened
as I sat thinking over my book. As I
looked up, by the faint red glow of the
wood-fire, I fancied that picture&mdash;a
St. Francis meditating&mdash;had a peculiar
expression about the eyes. The
rapt saint looks upward, ignoring
mundane vanities; this looked downward
and steadily at me. I felt inclined
to cut it open; but dared not.
After all, I imagined the gloom had
deceived me."</p>

<p>Again, two days later, "I was sitting
at breakfast with the cardinal,
when he dropped his cup of chocolate,
and, rising, went to the picture, and
carefully examined it.... We looked
at each other; and I felt the same
idea pass through his mind.... I
resolved to make him understand that
I followed his thoughts. 'Do you
think,' said I, 'that St. Francis in his
meditations became sometimes a little
<i>distrait</i>? that his eyes wandered from
heaven, for example, to some worldly
object, say, as to the quality of your
eminence's breakfast, or became suddenly
diverted by our conversation.'
He looked steadily at me, then at the
picture, which faced him as he sat, but
was behind me. Then, after a moment,
replied, 'It is a fatality.' I saw
no more of him that day. I heard
from the valet that he was anxious
not to be disturbed."</p>

<p>Here we have espionage of the
most wonderful kind caught <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in flagranti
delicto</i>. Is not the "secretary"
afraid he has imparted a new and important
lesson to the burglars of New
York? Just think of the details!
During the cardinal's absence, his enemies
enter his apartments in the Palazzo
Gabrielli freely, notwithstanding
the establishment is kept up, and all
the servants are there save the valet,
who is away with his master. No eye
sees them, no ear hears their stealthy
footsteps nor any noise they make.
No trace of their work is discovered.
They go everywhere, they examine
every thing, and make their preparations.
What they did elsewhere we
are not told. But they paid special
attention to this breakfast-room, because
the picture hung there. If the
wall behind it were of thick masonry,
they must have cut in it a niche
deep enough and big enough to hold
a man. That they should do this in
an inhabited house without any one
finding it out, is proof of their ability.
But what if, as is most likely, the
painting hung on a partition wall only
six or eight inches thick, where could
the man stand? What did they do
in that case? We cannot imagine.
We think the burglars would be nonplussed,
and would turn for further instruction
to the memory of our "secretary."
Beyond this, they provided
themselves with means of entrance
and passage from room to room, and
of exit, quite irrespective of ordinary
doors and public stairways.</p>

<p>The cardinal returns to his palace,
and these means are put in use. One
spy, entering when or how no one
knows, and mounting to his place in
an equally mysterious manner, stands
behind the picture of St. Francis meditating,
which hangs on the wall of
the breakfast-room. The canvas
eyes of the picture have, of course,
been cut out; and the spy fixes his
own living eyes in their place, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
he can see all that is to be seen, as
well as hear all that is to be heard.
Ordinarily, we suppose, the eyes are
kept turned toward heaven, ignoring
mundane vanities, because such was
the original position of the painted
eyes in the picture. But fatigue and
duty combined, from time to time, to
call for a change of their position.
The eyes looked down on the breakfast-table,
(perhaps longingly; for
even spies behind pictures may get
hungry,) or gleamed with intelligence
in response to witticisms of conversation,
or unguarded and important
revelations. Yet all was so artistically
and naturally done that the
secretary one day imagined the gloom
had deceived him; and two days
afterward, the cardinal, after a careful
examination and after looking at it a
second time attentively, exclaimed,
"It is a fatality!"</p>

<p>Now, there is a mystery about this
espionage which quite puzzles us, and
which we should like to see explained.
While the spy held his eyes thus glued
to or inserted in the painting, where
were his eyebrows? And what did he
do with his nose?&mdash;his big Roman
nose. For who can conceive a keen
Roman spy without a large and penetrating
Roman nose? How did he
manage to keep that nose from coming
in contact with the painted canvas&mdash;from
pressing against it and causing a
very prominent bulge, and even pushing
the canvas away from the eyes?
This is a point that merits elucidation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the cardinal, it seems,
at once left the room in which the
"fatality" was, shut himself up, and
would see no one. The "secretary"
was as wanting in pluck on that occasion
as he had been on another two
days before. He felt inclined to cut
the painting open to see what it was;
but dared not. If he had had the
presence of mind of a little boy ten
years old, he would have ventured to
draw the bottom of the painting a few
inches out from the wall, and would
have looked behind to discover the
secret. Had he done so, our mystery
would doubtless have been solved,
and a very interesting question would
have been answered. What a pity
the idea did not assume this practical
"ramification"!</p>

<p>In regard to the death of the cardinal
the memory of the "secretary"
is brief, but terribly explicit and pointed.</p>

<p>"Four days" after the fatality-scene,
"I was informed that the cardinal
desired me to spend the evening
in his private apartments.... We
had dined at five"&mdash;a change of hour;
it used to be six. "His eminence
had confined himself to his favorite
and insipid Chablis, of which he drank
one little flask," (Monte Fiascone
has slipped from the secretary's memory;)
"I to a more generous vintage
of Burgundy. The subject of
our conversation was exceedingly important.
With the idea upon us like
an incubus, we conversed in low
tones; and ever and anon the cardinal
rose and examined the outer door....
The conversation ended by my
being intrusted with certain documents
to place in safe keeping....
Knowing the importance of the documents,
I hesitated to keep them in my
possession. Sealing them in a packet,
I put on a street dress and hastened
to an English gentleman, who
cheerfully undertook their keeping....
Cardinal Antonelli asked me
for the papers I had received on that
fatal night.... I rejoice to say&mdash;though
strenuous exertions were made
to obtain the papers&mdash;they were as
persistently guarded; and I have them
now."</p>

<p>Pretty well remembered for these
papers. But how about the cardinal?</p>

<p>The secretary says that, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
morning after confiding the aforesaid
sealed packet to the English gentleman,
"I rose early and repaired to
the palace. The valet had orders to
wake his master at seven. It wanted
but a few minutes. I retired to my
own room. Scarcely a quarter of an
hour had elapsed ere the valet rushed
in, pale with affright, exclaiming,
'His eminence is dead!' I followed
him quickly to the apartment, having
alarmed the household. The disposition
of the chamber was as ordinary.
The cardinal's dress lay on a
chair, as the valet had placed it.
His breviary was open at vespers.
The bed was the only thing disturbed.
There were certain indications
of a struggle, although very slight.
The usually placid countenance of
the cardinal was flushed and discolored.
The two hands grasped the
bed-clothes convulsively. A physician
was hastily summoned, who pronounced
life to have been extinct
some hours. 'From what cause?' I
asked. He whispered, 'They will
probably say apoplexy.' For himself,
the secretary has no doubt it
was a murder perpetrated by the
enemies of Cardinal d'Andrea."</p>

<p>These are the recollections of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i> secretary. They are well
entitled in the whole and in the several
details to stand with his precise
recollections of the place and
date of the funeral that followed in
San Giovanni in Laterano, on the 22d
day of March, 1865.</p>

<p>The papers announced that Cardinal
d'Andrea died in Rome, on the
14th of May, 1868. For the details
of his last hours, we are indebted to
those members of his household who
were with him and closed his eyes.
It will be seen how different is the
account they give from that of the
writer who, if elsewhere he amused us,
here fills us with astonishment at the
boldness of his assertions, and sorrow
for his motives.</p>

<p>On Thursday, May 14th, 1868, the
cardinal, who had spent the forenoon
in his usual occupations, dined in his
usual health, or ill-health, at half-past
one. After dinner he continued to
transact business with his chancellor
for a while, and then arranged to resume
it on his return from the usual
afternoon drive. He drove out from
the Palazzo Gabrielli at about half-past
four. His coachman drove, at
the usual staid gait of a cardinal's
carriage, by the Foro Trajano, on by
the Colosseo and San Clemente, to
St. John Lateran's, and out of the
city gate near that church, along the
Via Appia Nuova. When he had
passed the first mile-stone from the
gate, he was surprised by an order to
return. He noticed that the cardinal,
who was alone in the carriage,
seemed to be suffering. He accordingly
turned and retraced his steps
at the same gentle gait. On the
square of St. John's, he received a
second order to go faster; and awhile
after, before he reached the Colosseo,
the cardinal ordered him to
hurry. A fast trot brought them to
the Palazzo Gabrielli by about half-past
five. The chancellor was there,
and assisted the servants to take the
cardinal out of the carriage, and to
assist him up to his chamber. He
was suffering very much from a difficulty
of breathing, and seemed otherwise
in pain. It was a crisis such
as he had had before, but it seemed
more severe than usual. The cardinal
sent word to the chancellor not
to leave. He expected the spasm to
pass away in a little while, and when
it would be over, they might resume
their work as arranged.</p>

<p>The chancellor waited until near
seven, when, learning that the attack
still continued, he entered the sickroom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
He was not only the official,
but a devoted and confidential intimate
friend of nearly twenty years'
standing. He found the cardinal
suffering to a degree that filled him
with alarm. A physician was sent for,
but was absent from his residence.
An assistant came and prescribed
some remedies. By eight, the physician
arrived, and took charge of the
case, and did not leave the patient.
About nine, he was asked if it were
proper to administer the sacrament
of extreme unction. He replied that,
so far, he did not see sufficient danger
to warrant it. Meanwhile the
cardinal lay on his bed tossing restlessly
in pain, and panting for breath,
but joining in, as best he could, with
the prayers for the sick, which had
been begun, at his request, by his
chaplain and the attendants between
seven and eight o'clock. At ten, he
asked to be placed in a large chair
in his room. They bolstered him up
in it. In half an hour he began to
sink. The chaplain hastily administered
the rites of the church, and
by eleven, Cardinal d'Andrea was no
more.</p>

<p>Thus, as is not unfrequently the
case, death came somewhat suddenly
and unexpectedly, even after years of
ill-health.</p>

<p>An autopsy took place, as is customary,
we believe, in Rome in the
case of cardinals. It appeared that
the immediate cause of his death
was congestion of the lungs. The
right lung was found to be nearly
destroyed by tubercles. On one side
of the brain a clot or indurated portion,
seemingly of long standing, was
discovered. In this lesion some of
the cardinal's friends thought they
found a physical cause of those disordered
peculiarities of mind of which
we spoke as having been manifested
in his later years.</p>

<p>We may add that, after the official
autopsy, the body lay in state in the
Palazzo Gabrielli until Monday, May
18th. On the evening of that day,
it was conveyed in procession to the
neighboring parish church of St. John
of the Florentines, near the Castel
Sant' Angelo. In that church, on
Tuesday, 19th May, 1868, the funeral
obsequies of Cardinal d'Andrea
were celebrated, the pope and the
cardinals assisting, as required by the
etiquette of the court when a cardinal
dies in Rome.</p>

<p>By the cardinal's own directions,
his mortal remains were interred at
the church of Sant' Agnese fuori delle
Mura, of which, as we said, he had
been titular cardinal before becoming
Bishop of Sabina.</p>

<p>We have thus followed this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i>
secretary of the late Cardinal
d'Andrea all through his article. We
have overlooked, for brevity's sake,
many minor points. But we have
seen fully enough to establish the
character of the article. We have
seen that he blunders as to the date
of the cardinal's funeral by three
years and two months. He has
blundered as to the church where it
was performed by at least a mile and
a half. San Giovanni in Laterano
and St. John of the Florentines are
unlike in shape and in rank, and are
nearly at opposite points of the city.</p>

<p>As to the private habits, the acts,
and the opinions of the cardinal, he
makes a series of blunders such as we
might well look for in one who gives
himself out as having been the confidential
secretary of the late Cardinal
d'Andrea, and yet whom no one remembers
to have ever had any connection
with the cardinal.</p>

<p>As to the charges of enmity, of
espionage, and even of murder, and
the tragedy of the French captain,
and various other remarks and comments
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i> throughout the article,
by no means to the honor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
the ecclesiastical dignitaries at Rome,
and of the tone and character of
society there&mdash;are these things only
spice to give a certain piquancy to
the article? or is the whole article
written merely as a vehicle to convey
these charges to the attention of the
readers?</p>

<p>We incline to the latter opinion.
We are led to it by the clearer and
more undisguised tenor of later articles
by the same pen in the <cite>Galaxy</cite>.
We may, hereafter, if we find time,
pay our respects to one or more of
those articles.</p>

<p>For the present, we will only say
that if the proprietors of the <cite>Galaxy</cite>
have intended to bargain with a writer
of fiction, they are getting the
worth of their money in matter and
quantity, if not in quality and style.
If, however, they expected to secure
a series of articles instructive because
truthful, the case is decidedly the
reverse.</p>

<h2>LOTHAIR.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></h2>


<p>Lothair is both a novel and a
pamphlet. Two distinct currents of
thought are apparent, running through
the work, variously intertwined and
blended, but from time to time asserting
definite individuality. This phenomenon
is explained by the two-fold
character of the writer, who is a novelist
and man of letters, and at the
same time a man of the world and a
statesman. The novel is written apparently
to reassert his powers and
demonstrate to the literary world
that his genius is undimmed by age,
perhaps also to indulge the exercise
of a favorite and successful art, by
which he has raised himself from an
obscure position to one of influence
and renown. The pamphlet is evidently
intended for political effect;
to throw discredit upon eminent persons,
to disparage the value of conversions
among the higher classes of society,
and, through the thin veil of fiction,
inflict all the damage possible
upon the court of Rome and the Roman
Catholic Church. It reveals
the political character of its writer,
his utter want of principle and consistency,
and enables us to comprehend
how he has overcome all the obstacles
to his career, by great industry,
acute intelligence, and absolute unscrupulousness
in turning men and
women, things and events, to his own
personal advantage. As a novel it
adds nothing to the established reputation
of the author. It is rated at a
high figure, commercially speaking,
and will no doubt be a remunerative
investment for its publishers.</p>

<p>It purports to be a picture of the
habits, manners, and mode of life of
people of the highest rank in England,
with sketches of persons of diverse culture
and foreign birth, to heighten the
contrasts and bring out the lights and
deepen the shadows. Natural scenery,
stately dwellings, ancient trees,
sunlight, flowers, music, and fresh air
give life and animation to the varying
scenes, and form the appropriate basis,
background, and accompaniment
for the living panorama. Lothair is
a youth of pure blood and fair education,
the heir of immense estates and
a lofty title. He is good-looking, athletic,
kind-hearted, shy, sensitive, and
sentimental.</p>

<p>He has suffered the depression and
discouragement of a sour Presbyterian
system of education, from which
he was happily rescued by the honest
and determined efforts of one of
his guardians, Cardinal Grandison.</p>

<p>He emerges just before he comes
of age, and appears before us in the
midst of an elegant family, in which,
fortunately, all the daughters are married
excepting one, who has great
beauty and a remarkably fine voice.
He immediately, as in duty bound,
falls desperately in love, and in the
most honorable manner possible confides
the state of his feelings to the
mother of the object of his affections,
who is, by the way, a fine specimen
of a thorough-bred English lady.</p>

<p>The mother wisely and tenderly
counsels delay, and we would recommend
her conduct in this interesting
occasion to all the middle-aged ladies
of our acquaintance when placed in
a similar situation. Lothair accepts
her decision, and in the mean time
becomes more and more intimate
with the cardinal, and forms the acquaintance
of a Catholic family distantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
connected, and becomes somewhat
smitten with the real heroine of the
tale, Clare Arundel. The objective
point of the story now develops itself.
A struggle for the rich and titled
youth commences between the English
Establishment and the Church.
Political and mercenary motives are,
with great impartiality, ascribed to
both the contending powers. The
combat between the rough and honest
Scotch Presbyterian uncle and the
accomplished and fascinating cardinal
is wisely dropped.</p>

<p>No imagination could suggest the
thought that one who had escaped
from evangelicalism could ever return
to it. It is, in the author's mind,
simply a political squabble for the
influence and vote of the future peer.
His soul is of no account.</p>

<p>The conduct and development of
this contest gives the right honorable
romancer an opportunity to introduce
the lords and ladies, the dukes and
bishops, cardinals and monsignori,
artists, wits, and men about town,
with whom he delights to fill his
pages. They all speak in character,
and in the main with artistic consistency,
and their conversation is certainly
sprightly, often witty, sometimes
wise, and never offensive on
the score of taste and morality. It
affords him the opportunity to flatter
and praise, and at the same time exhibit
a power of sarcasm and ridicule,
the effective methods of his earlier
writings, by which he climbed to his
present position. He exhibits talents
and a knowledge of life which would
have made him equally successful in
the role of banker, picture-merchant,
diamond-broker, or even old clo'man.
He gloats over the splendors which he
describes; and beauty, rank, fashion,
fine clothes, crystal, porcelain, pictures,
jewels, "ropes of pearls," castles, palaces,
parks, and gardens, are dwelt upon
with the cherishing fondness of the
gentlemen of keen eyes, hooked noses,
and unctuous touch. Character, conduct,
motives, principles, sentiments,
affections, passions, and religion are
mingled in admirable confusion, are
estimated at the same value and
weighed in the same balance.</p>

<p>There is for him as novelist or
pamphleteer no principle but expediency,
no rule of conduct but temporal
advantage. He worships a
golden calf. These be thy gods, O
Israel! At a critical period, while our
hero is wavering between his Anglican
and Catholic mistress, and the
cardinal is striving to acquire a
wholesome influence over his somewhat
unstable relative, while he is
sailing on the summer sea of high life
and elegant society, he goes to <i>Oxford
to see his horses</i>. He has wisely left
those useful animals at the university,
while he is pursuing his studies of
life and manners in London. At Oxford,
he meets Colonel and Mrs. Campian,
and is taken completely off his
feet. Presbyterianism, Anglicanism,
Corisande and Clare Arundel, the Establishment,
and Catholicity disappear
at once, and Madre Natura in the
splendid physique of the divine Theodora,
claims an unresisting captive and
victim.</p>

<p>This is either an inspiration of a
romancer's imagination or a study.
If the latter, there is no hope for the
right honorable author's salvation on
the score of invincible ignorance.</p>

<p>Lothair basks in the splendor of
Theodora's beauty, and surrenders
his reason to the fascination of her
false political principles. The lower
or transient good is preferred to the
higher, the permanent good. He
chooses the lower, as did Lucifer
and Adam, Judas and Luther, and
multitudes have done and are doing.
Naturally and artistically there is no
way out of this scrape excepting
through a catastrophe; religiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
excepting through penance. Theodora
is the ideal of Greco-Roman
heathenism, and the artist Ph&oelig;bus
is its high-priest. They are fine creations
from an artistic point of view.</p>

<p>They enable the author to introduce
some clever writing about art, and
some speculations regarding the
Aryan and Semitic races, evidently
with the intention of associating revealed
religion with the idea of superstition.
The effect left upon the
mind is something like that produced
by a certain class of sermons which
we read on Monday morning in the
New-York <cite>Herald</cite>. The novelist is
hurried on at this stage by the necessities
of the pamphleteer. Political
events succeed each other so rapidly
that he was obliged to send Lothair
as rapidly as possible to the field of
battle (his heathen destiny) against
the church.</p>

<p>With exceeding facility the money
which was going to build a cathedral,
to please a pious girl, is diverted to
aid in blowing up St. Peter's, and
Lothair finds himself as Captain Muriel,
in the field, on the staff of one of
his former acquaintances, Captain
Bruges, the red republican general
advancing against Rome. Theodora
and Colonel Campian are also with
him, the former disguised in male apparel,
and acting as secretary to the
general. We suppose her prayer uttered
under the depressing intelligence
of the embarkation of the
French troops to assist the holy
father, is an expression of the religion
of nature. Why she should pray
to God instead of Jupiter, we confess
we do not see, unless in deference to
the opinion of most of the author's
readers. He might have fulfilled all
the indications by quoting Pope, and
at the same time complimented the
memory of a poet who is getting
rather out of date.</p>

<p>However, she hears the French
have disembarked, and accordingly
suspends her prayers and recovers
her spirits. The impending catastrophe
comes. The tragic is accomplished,
and the divine Theodora is
slain. Madre Natura and the secret
societies are hurled against the rock
of Peter, and shivered. Theodora is
mortally wounded, and dying, impresses
a chaste kiss upon the lips of
Lothair, and exacts the promise never
to conform to the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>The next step finds him severely
wounded by a French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chassepot</i>, the
guest of Lord St. Jerome in his palace
in Rome, carefully attended by Sisters
of Charity and Clare Arundel. Nature
has perished and grace triumphs.
The venom of the anti-Catholic novelist
and the malice of the statesman
of the establishment are now revealed
in a popish plot, which is supposed
to be hatched by Lothair's
Roman Catholic friends, the prelates
of Rome, and, by implication, the
holy father.</p>

<p>The object of the conspiracy is to
impose upon Lothair and the world
that he was wounded while fighting
for the defence of the holy see, instead
of in the ranks of its determined
enemies, and to convince him that the
Blessed Virgin Mary personally appeared
to rescue him from inevitable
death. These pages enhance the
claims of the work as one of fiction,
but detract very much from its reputation
as a specimen of art. The plan
is thoroughly un-English, and incompatible
with the characters of the actors
as previously portrayed. It is by
no means impossible for the Blessed
Virgin or any saint or angel to appear,
and we should be bound to believe
the fact if vouched for on credible
testimony.</p>

<p>It is, however, naturally, politically,
and religiously impossible for priests,
bishops, and prelates to combine to
make any human being believe a lie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
or to palm off a false miracle for any
purpose whatsoever. We are charitably
left in doubt as to who believed
or who did not believe in the apparition,
but we are treated to a conversation
in which Cardinal Grandison
endeavors to make Lothair believe a
lie, and to abuse the enfeebled condition
of his brain to reduce him to a
condition of mental and moral imbecility.</p>

<p>Mr. Disraeli evidently expects no
advantages from Catholic voters, or,
perhaps, counts on the charity which
he abuses.</p>

<p>These passages are the only dangerous
ones in the book; they are skilfully
contrived to crystallize wavering
minds, especially of young men of
high rank, into determined opposition
to the holy see. They are intended to
awaken sympathy for Lothair's helpless
and almost hopeless captivity, and
to call forth sentiments of satisfaction
and pleasure at his adventurous escape.
He does escape, and falls
into the arms of high-priest Ph&oelig;bus
and two inferior divinities of Madre
Natura. They have little power,
however, the divine Theodora being
dead; and our hero, growing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasÃ©</i> if
not wiser and better, subsides into an
Ã¦sthetical but harmless admiration
of external nature and Euphrosyne.
Previously to his quitting Rome, the
author invents a scene which is either
a sop to spiritism, or an insult to his
readers' intelligence.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Blessed
Virgin, under any circumstances, is
treated with derision; but Theodora,
like the Witch of Endor, is summoned
to interview Lothair in the Coliseum,
and remind him of his fatal promise.
Perhaps he only means to illustrate a
phenomenon of an over-excited brain,
whose circulation is enfeebled by a
long illness and a severe wound. We
are left purposely in doubt on this
point, as on many others. This portion
of the book contains vivid and
beautiful sketches of camp-life and
fighting on a small scale, of Rome
and Italy, the Tyrrhenean Sea and
classic isles. Under the auspices of
the Ph&oelig;bus and Euphrosyne, he is
wafted in the yacht Pan to Syria and
the Holy Land, and sinks into a pleasing
and self-satisfied reverie on Mount
Olivet.</p>

<p>The descriptions of Judea and Jerusalem,
Calvary and Sion, Galilee
and Jordan, Lebanon and Bashan,
could be penned only by one who has
the traditions of the Jew, the Roman,
and the Christian. There is the
mournful regret of the Jew, the proud
remembrance of the Roman, and the
weak and sickly sentimentality of
a very doubtful sort of Christian.
They want depth and pathos, and
leave the mind disturbed and dissatisfied.
They profane rather than hallow
those sacred places which inspire
terror or love in every human breast.</p>

<p>The habits of his English friends
whom he meets in the Holy Land,
who made excursions which they called
pilgrimages, and feasted, made love,
and hunted, express about the degree
of sympathy which fashionable High-Church
Anglicanism has with Calvary.
The noble and gentle Syrian
now appears to put the finishing touch
to Lothair's religious experiences. He
is a new figure in fiction, a specimen of
oriental Turveydrop, and the patriarch
of a new school of Israelitish evangelicalism.
In the absence of authentic
data, we should presume he had
descended from a highly respectable
family of Pharisees, which had, in
process of time, intermarried with
the Sadducees, and perhaps suffered
some slight admixture with the heathen
round about. He happily succeeds
in removing all distinct and
vivid religious impressions from the
mind of Lothair, and prepares the
way, after a final interview with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
former Mazzinian general, who speaks
in a cheerful and airy manner of his
failure to blow up St. Peter's, and
consoles Catholic readers with the
assurance that the old imposture is
still firmly seated, for his return to
England, the arms of Lady Corisande,
and the bosom of the church by law
established. Here we leave him
married to an heiress and laid up in
lavender, to grow old, fat, and gouty.</p>

<p>While we may speak with some degree
of complaisance of this novel as
a work of art merely, and a picture
of life and manners, in which it is far
inferior to similar novels of Bulwer
and several other contemporary writers
of fiction, we are compelled to
discuss this production in its political
and moral significance in a very different
spirit. Mr. Disraeli must have
some powerful motive to induce him
to attack the church and outrage the
feelings of Catholics throughout the
world while he himself has no settled
and strong religious convictions of
any kind. That motive must be the
only one which would operate upon a
mind like his&mdash;the desire to get back
to power. He starts the "No-popery"
hue and cry, and invents a most contemptible,
shallow, and flimsy plot to
influence what he supposes to be the
radical hostility of the English people
to the Church of Rome, and to throw
contempt and discredit upon the conversion
of Englishmen of rank, and
especially that of the Marquis of Bute.
We think he has not only committed
a moral crime, but made a gross political
blunder. We believe there is a
profound sympathy throughout the
world in the hearts of simply honest
and good people with the holy father,
and that if the question could be tested
by vote to-day, Who is the best man
living? Pius IX. would receive an
overwhelming majority. While denouncing
in the strongest terms the
baseness of the attempt to impute fraud,
chicanery, and political trickery to the
policy and plans of the church, we
have reason to thank the right honorable
and learned author for the revelation
he has made of the secret societies.
He has had ample means of
learning and understanding their operations,
and his implied conclusion is,
that the two great forces arrayed
against each other in the modern
world are the Roman Catholic Church
and the secret societies, of whom Masonry
is the mother. This is a conclusion
which we accept. It is the everlasting
antagonism between the church
of Christ and the church of the devil.
We hope the glimpse thus afforded
will cause some of our clergy to reconsider
the lenient opinions they
sometimes express in regard to Masonry
and its offshoots, and to recognize
the supernatural wisdom that has
directed the unwavering opposition
which the church has manifested toward
these works of darkness. As a
whole, we do not think <cite>Lothair</cite> will
do much harm. It will provoke much
conversation and discussion. It will
be praised, ridiculed, admired, and
contemned, and speedily sink into
oblivion, to be read only by students
of literature and those who seek for
the light that works of fiction throw
upon contemporary history. It reminds
us of something which occurred
a long time ago, and which cannot
be offensive to the right honorable
gentleman, who finds a pleasure in
insulting cardinals and bishops, inasmuch
as the chief personages in the
transaction are prototypes of himself
and his book. It is the story of Balaam
and Balaam's ass. He has attempted
to curse, and in fact he has
blessed, and the ass which he is riding
only speaks like a human being when
it meets the angel in the Catholic girl
Clare Arundel.</p>

<h2>THE INVITATION HEEDED.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></h2>


<p>The above is the title of one of the
best and most effective controversial
works which we have had the pleasure
to read for some time. For
those who believe in any historical
Christianity, the argument contained
in it is direct and unanswerable. We
pray God it may have a wide circulation
and reach the numerous friends
of its gifted author, who thus seeks, as
many converts have done before him,
to show to those he loves the blessed
lights which guided him to the home
of truth and peace.</p>

<p>Mr. James Kent Stone is the son
of the Rev. Dr. John S. Stone, a
highly respected minister of the Protestant
Episcopal Church, favorably
known for many years in Brooklyn
as the rector of Christ's church, and
now, we believe, at the head of an
Episcopalian seminary in Cambridge,
Mass. He received his academical
education at Harvard College, and
afterward spent two years at one of
the universities of Germany. Returning
to this country in 1862, he
was appointed professor of Latin in
Kenyon College, Ohio, in which office
he remained until 1867, when he
was made president of the institution.
He was ordained a minister
of the Protestant Episcopal Church
in 1866, and shortly after received
the degree of D.D. from Racine
College, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In the year 1868, he was elected
to the presidency of Hobart College,
Geneva, New York, where he remained
only one year. In September,
1869, he resigned his position
and his ministry, to seek retirement
and prepare for his reception into the
Holy Catholic Church. The 8th of
December, 1869, the feast of the Immaculate
Conception, was the happy
day of his entrance into the communion
of Christ, in obedience to the call
of its chief pastor.</p>

<p>In the prefatory chapter the author
gives us some insight into the
trials of his own mind. Accepting
what he had taken for granted as the
high Anglican position, he felt himself
master of the Roman question.
Anglicans were, in his mind, true Catholics,
the <em>only</em> true Catholics, and
the Reformation was a return to primitive
truth on the part of a favored
few, who were to him the only witnesses
of God upon earth. His intellect
was too logical not to see that
ritualism, with which he never allied
himself, was inconsistent with any
possible degree of Anglicanism.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the ritualists were right, the reformers
were wrong. The great sin of
schism could never have been justified by
any such paltry differences as separate our
'advanced' friends from the great Roman
communion. The only consistent course
for men to take who believed in the sacrifice
of the altar and in the invocation of
saints was to go back, promptly and penitently,
to the ancient church, which had
proved its infallibility by being in the right
after all."</p></blockquote>

<p>In this position, to any unprejudiced
eye, he stood upon an assumption
of theology and history which
it would seem that the slightest investigation
should destroy. A church
which begins by denying the faithfulness
of Christ to his promises, and
asserts for itself claims which render
all antiquity a fable, ought not long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
to hold the love of an honest heart.
It would be hard for any one to
know what the English church really
teaches; and if it teaches any thing,
it certainly does so upon human authority,
since infallibility is denied in
itself, and in every other communion.
When our eyes are once opened, we
wonder we were so long deluded.
The real reason why High-Churchmen
do not become Catholics is, that they
do not sincerely wish to know the
truth, which calls to sacrifices and
sad trials of the heart.</p>

<p>"If any man love father or mother
more than me, he is not worthy of
me." We believe that one earnest
prayer for light, with a full determination
to follow it at every cost without
hesitation, would lead to the one
home of truth every Anglican, and
even every ritualist. But the misfortune
is, that they will not offer any
such prayer. The world of honor or
affection in which they move is too
dear to be renounced. Let us hear
what Dr. Stone so feelingly tells of
his own experience:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Time went on; and I was not conscious
of the smallest change in my theological
opinions and sympathies; when all at once
the ground upon which I had stood with
such careless confidence, gave way. Like
a treacherous island, it sank without warning
from beneath my feet, and left me struggling
in the wide waters. Thanks be to
God that I was not left to perish in that cold
and bitter flood, and that my feet so soon
rested for ever on the eternal rock! How
it came about&mdash;by what intellectual process
my position had been undermined&mdash;by what
unconscious steps my feet had been led to
an unseen brink, I did not know. I was
only aware of the sudden terror with which
I found myself slipping and going, and the
darkness which succeeded the swift plunge."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>"I remembered how St. Augustine, 'one
of the profoundest thinkers of antiquity,'
even for four years after he had become a
catechumen under St. Ambrose, was entangled
in the meshes of his ManichÃ¦an heresy.
I admitted instantly that I, too, <em>might be</em> under
a spell; that my case might be&mdash;I do
not dare to say like that of the great saint
and father, but that of the Donatists or the
Gnostics; since I was certainly not more
positive in my convictions than they, neither
could I furnish myself with any satisfactory
reason for believing that I was blessed with
greater light. And then the hand of God
drew back the veil of my heart; and I saw
for the first time, and all at once, how utterly
steeped I had been in prejudice, how
from the beginning I had, without a question
or suspicion, assumed the very point about
which I ought reverently to have inquired
with an impartial and a docile mind. I had
studied the Roman controversy; so I thought&mdash;if
in my short life I could fairly be said to
have studied any thing; but <em>how</em> had I studied
it? Had there ever been a time when
it was an <i>open question</i> in my mind whether
the claims of the Roman Church were valid?
Had I begun by admitting that the pope
might be right? Had it ever crossed my
thoughts that the church in communion with
the see of Peter might be indeed the one
only Catholic Church of our Lord Jesus
Christ? And had I ever resolved, with all
my soul, as one standing on the threshold
and in the awful light of eternity, to begin
by tearing down every assumption and divesting
myself of every prejudice, and <em>then</em>,
wherever truth should lead the way, to follow&mdash;'leave
all and follow'? Alas! never.
I had studied simply to combat and refute.
The suggestion that 'Romanism' might
after all be identical with Christianity was
preposterous. The papacy was the great
apostasy, the mystery of iniquity; it was
the master-piece of Satan, who had made
his most successful attack upon the church
of God by entering and corrupting it. The
rise of the papal pretensions was matter of
the plainest history; and every well-instructed
child could point out how one fiction after
another had been grafted into the creed of
that apostate church, until now the simple
faith of early days was scarce recognizable
under the accumulated error of centuries.
'History'&mdash;who <em>wrote</em> that history? 'Well-instructed
child'&mdash;why, that was the very
point at issue!</p>

<p>"I saw that I had been guilty of what
Bossuet calls 'a calumny,' and what I now
acknowledged to be an act of injustice, namely,
of charging upon Catholics <i>inferences</i>
which I had myself drawn from their doctrines,
but against which Catholics indignantly
protest. I could not say with St.
Augustine that 'I blushed with joy;' but
with shame I blushed, 'at having so many
years barked, not against the Catholic faith,
but against the fictions of carnal imaginations.
For so rash and impious had I been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
that what I ought by inquiring to have
learned, I had pronounced on, condemning....
I should have knocked and proposed
the doubt, how it was to be believed,
not insultingly opposed it as if believed.'</p>

<p>"This is the 'plunge' I spoke of. I used
the word because it expressed, as well perhaps
as any other, the terrifying rapidity
which marked the steps of my intellectual
crisis. Upon some men the discovery of a
life-long error may break gradually; truth
may be said to have its dawning; but to me
it came with a shock. The rain descended
and the floods came; my house fell; and
great was the fall of it.</p>

<p>"Then followed a sense of blank desolateness.
I was groping among ruins; and
wherewith should I go to work to build
again? I do not mean that I faltered.
Thank God that he kept me true, and suffered
me not to shrink from the sharp agony
which I perceived was <em>possibly</em> in store for
me! To borrow words of the great father
from whose experience I have already drawn,
'God gave me that mind, that I should prefer
nothing to the discovery of truth, wish,
think of, love naught besides.' But the
task of reconstruction seemed almost helpless.</p>

<p>"And so I set my face forward with desperate
earnestness; and in due time&mdash;it may
seem, a very short time&mdash;I had not a trace
of doubt left that I had all along been a vain
enemy of the one, catholic, and apostolic
church. Why <em>not</em> in a short time? Why
not in a month, or a week, or a day? Is it
any reflection upon truth that she surrenders
herself quickly to a soul whose every nerve
is strained in her pursuit? Is it any argument
against the church of God that it is
easily identified? Surely, if there be a
kingdom of heaven upon earth, it must be
known by marks which cannot be mistaken.
Yes! I knew it when I had found it. And I
found it as in the parable, like a treasure
hidden in a field&mdash;in the self-same field up
and down which I had wandered for years,
and where I had often trampled it under my
feet. And when I had found it, I hid it,
scarce daring to gaze at its splendor, and crying,
as St. Augustine cried, 'Too late, alas!
have I known thee, O ancient and eternal
truth!' And then, for joy thereof, I went
and sold all that I had, and bought that
field."</p></blockquote>

<p>The pages which follow this preface
are a brief but cogent exposition of the
convictions which forced themselves
upon the mind of the author. He
develops the argument which proved
so availing in his own case, and which,
it seems to us, should be satisfactory to
any earnest inquirer. He commences
by viewing the Catholic Church in
its historical aspects, as the human eye
beholds it, and without any necessary
reference to its supernatural character.
The attitude of the world toward it in
the present and in every age is a
proof of its greatness, for men neither
fear nor attack an enemy which they
despise. Its wonderful life, in spite
of opposition which would long ago
have destroyed any merely human
organization, is so striking a fact that
no honest mind can fail to feel its
force.</p>

<p>But it is not only as a <em>living</em> body,
with a vitality unknown to any other
society, that it impresses our intellects;
in its wonderful life it has been the
guardian of morals, and the author
of every high virtue. Civilization
owes its very existence to its creed
and its fostering care. And while
Protestantism, of only recent origin,
has failed to accomplish any thing but
destruction, there is no sign of decay
or feebleness in the ancient and unchanging
church.</p>

<p>In the second part of the work the
author gives the reasons in full for
this wonderful vitality, and shows how
the "Word made flesh" is the source
of life to that body which he fills, and
which the Paraclete sent by him ever
animates. The facts of Christianity
are clearly drawn out, and the necessary
notes of the church are tried by
the appeal to holy Scripture and tradition.
From the conclusion of this
argument there is no escape, and it is
well demonstrated that the religion of
Christ stands or falls with the Catholic
faith.</p>

<p>In the concluding portion of the
book, Dr. Stone looks carefully at the
essential features of that body which
the incarnate God, as a master-builder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
framed with one head, and all the
needful constituents of a perfect organism.
The office of St. Peter was
not simply an ornamental appendage
to the company of apostles, but an
integral and essential part in the complex
of visible Christianity. The
church is Christianity in the concrete,
and can no more exist without St.
Peter than the human body can live
without a head. And to that head
all the functions of the body are subordinated.
There is no fear of any
unjust preponderance, or that any
member of the body will lose its activity
or honor; for the Holy Ghost
lives in the body, and speaks through
the mouth of its head. The functions
of the primacy are displayed with
beautiful clearness in this work, which
without any unnecessary words refutes
the arguments of objectors, and cuts
to pieces their vain appeals to history
or antiquity. We are much pleased
to see how an honest mind, which
had no reason to seek for Catholic
truth except for its own sake, has been
able to see how all the functions of
the papacy are involved in the very
constitution of the church.</p>

<p>The infallibility of the sovereign
pontiff as "the father and the teacher
of all Christians" is directly deduced
from the position he holds in the ecclesiastical
body, and the needs of
his office. We earnestly commend
this work to those who are searching
for truth, and are willing to embrace
it when it presents itself. While there
is no new argument, there is great
freshness in the manner in which it is
conducted. There are very many
who would not become Catholics even
if Almighty God were to work miracles
before their eyes. We say this
advisedly and from sad experience.
They are too attached to the circles
in which they move; and even when
divine light urges them keenly, they
are willing to take the risk. So they
compound with their consciences by
assuming a great spiritual activity in
their own spheres, and the noon of
their day of grace passes away. They
will never see again the freshness and
life of the morning.</p>

<p>There are others who deal with
truth as they would be ashamed to
deal with any affair of human life.
They ask that every difficulty, historical
or theological, shall be removed
from the vast field of controversy ere
they will yield assent to a proposition
they are forced to admit, which is
the key of the whole position. To
those who will not be guided by the
light of faith, this is an unending task.
They are worse than the Jews, who
would not believe "unless they saw
signs and wonders." The Catholic
Church does not offer any more trials,
to the understanding than did the
meek and lowly Man of Sorrows in
his sojourn upon earth. All difficulties
cannot be removed at once, nor
before the shadows of error have
given way to the bright sun of truth.
We cannot see perfectly in the night;
yet there is really but one question
to be asked and answered, Did Jesus
Christ, my divine Redeemer, found the
Catholic Church, and promise it perpetuity?
If so, then I am bound to
accept it as I find it; for I cannot
make a church for myself, nor could
he allow the communion which he
formed and vivified to fall into error.
If I will not accept this church, I
may wander on the waste without a
guide, for there is no such thing as
Christianity for me.</p>

<p>Another thing which this book impresses
upon us is very important, and
it is a truth which we have had occasion
to know from long acquaintance
with Protestantism. There is
only one way of dealing with those
whom we believe to be in error, and
that is by always maintaining with,
consistency the principles of our creed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
Any attempt to compromise with
Protestants, as if there were not a
diametrical opposition between truth
and falsehood, will be disastrous to
their conversion. Men will not give
up the associations of years, renounce
position and hopes, and even break
family ties, unless they believe it necessary
to their salvation. Nothing
less than this motive can be held up
to the wanderer who seeks in vain
from his own intellect the lights that
will guide him to a happy eternity.
And any converts that come into the
church from any lower motive are
unfit for the graces of faith, and will
never imbibe the spirit of a true
Catholic. There is one God and one
church, and this church is a necessity
to all to whom its message of mercy
comes. It can stand upon this ground
alone as a divine organization, and
here only can demand the obedience
of mankind.</p>

<p>There are many souls sadly in need
and without a religion, which is the
first want of our nature. There are
many who are trying to gain time
against the Spirit of God by postponing
the hour of sacrifice. There are
those who, in hollow mockery of their
highest aspirations, are playing with
shadows, and deceiving themselves
with counterfeits of the truth. We
pray God that this book may fall
into their hands, and be a messenger
from on high, bidding them look well
to foundations which are built on the
sand, and can never abide the tempest
of human passion, much less the
storm of God's judgment.</p>

<h2>THE FIRST &OElig;CUMENICAL COUNCIL OF THE VATICAN.<br />

<small>NUMBER SIX.</small></h2>


<p>Holy-Week in Rome! How many
Christian hearts have yearned for it,
have looked forward to it in hope!
How many recall it among the sweetest
and most precious memories of
the past! In this sacred city, and in
this most solemn season, a spell is
thrown around the faithful pilgrim;
or rather, he is released in a great measure
from the delusive spells of the
world. Mind and heart, and, we
might almost say, the body too, seem
to live in a new world, in which the
all-absorbing thought and affair is
the grand mystery of what God has
done in his infinite power and love
to redeem this fallen race of man.</p>

<p>What emotions must fill the catholic
heart as, after perhaps a long and
weary journey, one is rapidly borne
on by the train from Civita Vecchia,
and knows at last that within one hour
he will be in Rome. The yellow Tiber
is flowing by the railway track,
sluggishly and silently, on to the sea.
At intervals, antique-looking barges,
with high-peaked prows and high
sterns, are floating down, heavily
laden with boxes of statuary and of
marbles, or of other works of art&mdash;it
may be, of books or of baggage. A
couple of oars suffice to keep the vessel
in mid-channel, or to accelerate
its motion. Perhaps, if the course of
the sinuous river allows it, a huge lateen-sail
on a heavy stump of a mast
helps it onward. Perchance, too, a
tiny steamer meets him, puffing its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
way downward; or the train overtakes
another breasting the stream
and towing up three or four barges,
each larger than itself. The eye travels
across the classic river, and
roams over the rolling surface of the
campagna, and takes notes of the
many ruins that dot its surface, mostly
relics of the mausoleums and massive
tombs with which the Romans
of old were wont to line their roads
leading from the city, for miles and
miles. At length Rome is at hand;
across the Tiber you see the new St.
Paul's <i>extra muros</i>, rising like a ph&oelig;nix
after the ruinous conflagration of
1823, and not yet entirely finished.
The great apostle was buried here
after his martyrdom. Here his body
has ever been venerated. Some day,
and soon, you may come hither, and
in the splendor of that church look
down into the confession to catch a
glimpse of the interior of the underground
crypt, and the sarcophagus
within it, in which lie his mortal remains,
and read the large letters on
it, <i>Paullus Apostolus Martyr</i>, "Paul,
the Apostle and Martyr." On the lofty
summit of the front, plainly visible,
is the gigantic statue of the apostle
himself, bearing the emblematic
sword&mdash;as if standing sentinel and
guarding the approach to the Holy
City, which he consecrated by his
preaching and his death. Soon you
are on the bridge over the stream, and
all eyes are turned to the left, where
above the city walls, now visible, and
the roofs of houses, and the cupolas
of many churches, you see for a moment
or two the majestic dome of
St. Peter's towering over all. The
road runs around the walls of the
city for some distance before entering,
and St. Peter's is soon shut out from
view, only to be replaced by the majestic
front of St. John of Lateran's,
near at hand. But on the other side,
you see more clearly than before the
campagna with its multitude of ruins,
and the Sabine and Alban Mountains.
In the clear atmosphere you
can distinguish the vineyards and
olive groves, and dark forests, and
cities and towns and pleasant villas.
Along the campagna, from the foot of
these hills, there stretches for miles
on miles, like a huge centipede, a
long line of dark and jagged masonry,
borne aloft on massive piers and
arches. It is an old aqueduct, or, as
your guide-book tells you, three aqueducts
in one. You dash through one
of those arches, and the panorama
is changed. Other mountains in the
distance, with other cities and towns,
other ruins on the campagna&mdash;the
ancient basilicas of St. Lawrence and
St. Agnes near at hand. At length
you pass through an archway of the
wall into the city. St. John of Lateran's
is again before you. Not distant
is the church of Santa Croce; and St.
Mary Major's, with its cupolas, its
mediÃ¦val belfry, and its obelisk, is
even nearer. The balmy breeze of
the afternoon brings to your ear the
sweet chime of its many bells. You
are on the Quirinal hill, and can look
over some portion of the city, with
its belfries, and cupolas, its red-tiled
roofs, and many-windowed houses.
Near by are massive ruins. The excavations
of the railway track have
unearthed broken columns, frescoed
walls of ancient rooms, and masses of
travertino masonry, belonging to the
walls which Servius Tullius, the fifth
king of Rome, built around the city.
Issuing from the depot to seek your
hotel, you are at once before the ruins
of the baths of Dioclesian, and the
Cistercian Abbey, and the church of
St. Mary degli Angioli. Your way
leads by churches, palaces, ruins,
obelisks, statues, and ever-gushing
fountains, through a maze of narrow
streets with sharp turns. You understand
that these streets were not laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
out, and the houses built on clear
ground. The houses stand more or
less on the foundations of older buildings
that have perished, and follow, to
a limited extent, the course of those
foundations. As for the streets, they do
as they can, under the circumstances,
and seldom have the same breadth
and direction for three hundred yards
at a time. Every thing tells you of
olden heathen Rome that has perished,
and of a new Rome that has
arisen in its place, not to be compared
to its predecessor in size or in earthly
magnificence, but infinitely superior
in spiritual and moral grandeur.</p>

<p>Without an hour's unnecessary delay,
you seek St. Peter's. A glance of
wonder at the vastness and majesty
of its approaches, of its front, and its
portals, is all you will give now; for
the heart is filled with a sense of that
glory of which all this, great as it is,
is but a figure. You pass through
the vestibule, large as a magnificent
cathedral, push aside the heavy curtain
before the inner door, and you
are within the grand basilica. The
light is evenly diffused and soft, and
comes through unseen windows. The
temperature is pleasant. If outside
you found the day cold and unpleasant,
here the atmosphere seems warm
and agreeable. If outside it was
hot, here you feel it cool and refreshing.
As you look at the vast
expanse of the building, you wonder
at the solitude. It seems almost vacant;
although, if you could count
them, there are hundreds moving
about, or kneeling here and there in
silent prayer, and scores are entering
or going out. As you advance up
the broad and lofty central nave,
there come from a chapel on the left
the rolling sounds of an organ, and
the chorus of many voices, as canons
are chanting the daily vespers in
their own chapel. Further on, from
the other side, you hear the murmuring
of many voices. A long line of
pilgrims, or the members of some
confraternity, have come in procession
to pray in St. Peter's; and as
they kneel before the altar, perhaps
a hundred devout men and women
from the parish, or of those accidentally
in the church, have gathered around
them, and have knelt and join in their
chanted hymns and prayers. On
still you proceed, until you are beneath
the lofty dome itself, and have
approached the oval railing of marble
which is united to the grand altar,
and on which ever burn a hundred
and forty-two lamps. You look over
into the opening in the marble pavement,
which is called the confession
of St. Peter's, and you see below the
floor of the ancient church, and
immediately under the present high-altar
stands the chief altar of that
ancient church. Though you do not
see it, you know that still deeper, and
below that altar, is a small chamber
in the earth, whose floor and sides
and arched roof are all of large
blocks of dressed stone&mdash;travertino&mdash;and
that in that vaulted chamber
stands the marble sarcophagus which
contains the remains of St. Peter, the
chief of the apostles, the founder and
the first Bishop of Rome, who was
crucified under Nero, in the year 67,
on the hill near by, and whom pious
Christian hands reverently buried in
this very spot, ever since sacred to
the followers of Christ. Then it was
an obscure spot, outside the city, near
certain brickyards on the Aurelian
Way. Now it is covered by the
grandest temple which the world ever
saw, on which all that man can do or
give of most precious is offered and
consecrated to the service of religion
and the glory of God.</p>

<p>A poor, humble, simple-minded
fisherman on the Lake of Genesareth,
in Galilee, whom men called Simon,
was chosen by our Lord; his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
was changed to Peter, a rock&mdash;for on
that rock the church of Christ would
be built; to him were given the keys
of the kingdom of heaven, and he
was charged with the duty of confirming
his brethren in the faith. At
the command of his Lord, and in the
power of the divine commission, he
went forth to his work of zeal and
of trials. Like his divine Master,
poor, persecuted, crucified, he was
the instrument of God for mighty
things. Empires and kingdoms have
perished; but the church still stands.
Dynasties have succeeded dynasties,
and have passed away like the shadows
of clouds in spring; but the
line of successors to St. Peter continues
unbroken. The intellect and
study, the passions, the violence, and
the inconstancy of men have changed
all things human, again and again,
within eighteen centuries; but
there remaineth <i>one Lord</i>, <i>one faith</i>,
<i>one baptism</i>, one church of Christ,
against which the gates of hell cannot
prevail. And here, to-day, you stand
at the earthly centre of that spiritual
kingdom, by the tomb of him to
whom Christ gave promises which
must ever stand true, though heaven
and earth pass away. You can but
kneel and pray with all the fervor of
your heart, taking no account of
others near you, nor of the passage of
time. And when at length earnest
prayer has brought calm and holy
joy to your soul, you may rise and
look up into the dome, rising four
hundred feet above you, with mosaics
of evangelists, and prophets, and
angels, archangels, and all the grades
of the celestial host, until in the summit,
amid a blaze of light, the "Ancient
of Days" looks down from
heaven, in power and majesty, blessing
the worshippers of earth, and
bending forward to receive the prayers
of all who come to this holy and
consecrated temple to pour forth
their supplications and entreat his
mercy. You may examine the
grandiose proportions of nave and
transept and aisle, the mosaics, and
marbles, and statues, and saints; you
may go forth into the vast vestibule,
guarded at one extremity by an
equestrian statue of Constantine, and
at the other by one of Charlemagne;
you may linger, as you look again at
the mighty square in front of the basilica,
with its magnificent ever-flowing
fountains, so typical of the waters
of life, its colonnades stretching away
hundreds of yards on either side, like
arms put forth to embrace the multitudes
of the children of men, and
the lofty, needle-formed Egyptian
obelisk in the centre, pointing toward
heaven. On its summit is a bronze
casket, containing a portion of the
true cross on which the Saviour suffered
death; and at the base is an
inscription, brief in words, and here
most sublime in its appositeness.
Your heart takes in the full meaning
as you read, <i>Christ reigns. Christ
rules; Christ has conquered. May
Christ defend us from every ill.</i></p>

<p>This is the spirit, the key-note, as it
were, of Christian life in Rome. We
might say, also, that it is the animating
principle of her temporal existence.
For, save as the centre of the Catholic
Church and the see of Peter, Rome
would quickly perish. On the hills
of the campagna and on the slopes
of the mountains around, may still be
seen faint vestiges of cities and towns
that were illustrious centuries before
Rome was founded. They have utterly
perished. Others of the same
class seem to drag out a lingering existence,
as obscure villages, of no importance,
whose names no one mentions,
and whose ancient history is known
only to antiquarians. Many a desert,
forest, or plain can show ruins to rival
those of the seven hills. Florence,
and many a modern city, can boast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
of galleries of the fine arts and museums
to rival, if not to surpass, most
of those in Rome. No, it is not for
her antiquity, nor for her grand ruins
of past ages, nor for her paintings and
sculpture, her marbles and mosaics,
that Rome stands unrivalled in the
world. These are but accessories.
Neither they nor any mere human
gift can suffice to explain the mystery
of her survival, despite so many convulsions
and shocks, and her continued
and prosperous existence, where all
around her has sunk into decay and
ruin. Were there no other source of
life, these would soon fail her. The
treasures of art and antiquity in her
galleries, and museums, and public
buildings would soon be shattered by
spoliation or conquest, and she would
be left desolate and stricken like her
crumbling ruins. It is the moral
power of Christianity which gives her a
life and a strength beyond that of the
sword. It is the presence of that
pontiff who is the visible head of
the church, and the centre of Catholic
unity and of spiritual authority,
which saves her from the fate of other
cities. Her true source of life is her
religious position. When, centuries
ago, the popes, wearied out by the
tumults of the people and the turbulence
of the barons, withdrew for
peace' sake, and abode for seventy
years in Avignon, Rome dwindled
down to be little better than a village
of ten or fifteen thousand souls. The
Romans spoke of that time as a Babylonian
captivity. With the return
of the pontiffs, prosperity was again
restored. When, in the early part of
the present century, Pius VII. was
borne away and held captive for years
in France, and Rome was annexed
to the French empire, the population
of the city quickly sank to one hundred
and thirteen thousand, and was rapidly
diminishing. When he returned, in
1814, it began to rise again, and
to-day Rome has nearly double that
population. Were the sovereign pontiff
to be driven into exile to-morrow, as
Garibaldi and Mazzini, and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Italianissimi</i>
of Florence desire, Rome
would again, and at once, enter on a
downward career of misery and ruin.
In twenty years she would lose all
her treasures and half of her population.
All this is clear to the Romans
themselves; all the more clear from
the fate which has overtaken those
cities of the states of the church which
were annexed to the kingdom of Italy
eight or ten years ago. No wonder
that, in 1867, neither the artful emissaries
of Ratazzi nor the military parade
of Garibaldi was able to gather
recruits to their attempt, either from
the country around or from the city
itself. The Romans would shudder
at the thought of a renewal of that
attempt, as at a terrible calamity.</p>

<p>But we must not wander away
into such considerations. This theme,
though most important to the Romans
and often on their lips, is of too
worldly a character. For this month,
at least, we leave it aside, and join
that immense crowd of strangers who
have filled Rome, drawn hither to
look on the council, and to unite in
the solemn offices of Holy-Week, more
solemn and imposing this year than
perhaps ever before, on account of
the vast number of bishops uniting in
their celebration. Once, the German
element used to stand prominent before
all others, in the crowd of strangers
that flocked to Rome for Holy-Week;
afterward the English, and laterly
the Americans, became conspicuous.
This year, although they were
probably as numerous as ever, they
seemed to sink into the background
before the vast number of French who
filled the holy city, and who, almost
without exception, had come in the
spirit of earnest, fervent Catholics.
They were fully as numerous and fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
as demonstrative as at the centenary
celebration in 1867. Their coming
was announced by the ever-increasing
numbers who, each day that a general
congregation of the council was held,
gathered at St. Peter's at half-past
eight <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, to see the bishops enter,
or at one <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, to see them come forth
from the council hall.</p>

<p>In ordinary times, the pope and
cardinals celebrate nearly all the offices
of Holy-Week, not in St. Peter's,
which is left to the canons and clergy
of that basilica, but in the Sixtine
chapel, which is the pope's court chapel,
so to speak, within the Vatican
palace. It is as large as a moderate
American church. About one half is
railed off as a sanctuary for the pontiff,
and the cardinals and their attendants,
and for the other clergymen
who are required or are privileged to
attend the services in this chapel. The
remaining half, assigned to the laity,
will hold four or five hundred seated
or standing, as the case may be. The
number desiring to enter is so great
that often a seat can be obtained only
by coming two or three hours before
the time for commencing the services.
This year, if the bishops were to be
present, the whole chapel would have
to be used as a sanctuary, and no
room would remain for any of the laity.
To avoid this embarrassment,
and the consequent disappointment
of thousands, it was settled that this
year the papal services of Holy-Week
should be celebrated, not in this Sixtine
chapel, but in St. Peter's itself,
where, besides all the bishops, ten
thousand others might attend, and
seem only a moderate-sized crowd
grouped close to the sanctuary.</p>

<p>To St. Peter's, then, on Palm-Sunday
morning, came the papal choir,
and half a thousand bishops, archbishops,
primates, and patriarchs, the
cardinals with their attendants, and
the holy father himself, for the blessing
of the palms and the other services
of the day. They were substantially
the same as the services in
ten thousand other churches of the
Catholic world that day. But here,
there were of course a splendor and
magnificence that could be rivalled
nowhere else. The palms to be blessed
lay in masses regularly arranged
near the throne of the pontiff. They
seemed scarcely to differ from the
branches of our southern palmetto.
On many of them the long leaves were
fancifully plaited, so as to represent
a branch surrounded by roses, lilies,
leaves, and crosses. The Catholic
negroes that came to the United
States from San Domingo years ago
used to do something similar. There
is an interesting story about these
palms. On the tenth of September,
1586, Fontana, the architect and
engineer of St. Peter's, was to lift
to its present position in the middle
of the square before St. Peter's, the
immense unbroken mass of stone
which formed an Egyptian obelisk
that had been erected in the amphitheatre
of Nero, and still stood not
far off, its base buried in the earth that
centuries had accumulated around it.
It was a mighty, a perilous work, to
transport this obelisk, three hundred
yards, ever keeping it in its upright
position, and at the end to lift it up
and plant it on the lofty pedestal.
Pope Sixtus V. and all Rome were
there to look on. In default of steam-engines
and hydraulic rams, not then
invented, Fontana used a huge scaffolding,
ropes, blocks and tackle, and
windlasses, and hundreds of operatives.
Any mistake or confusion as
to orders or delay in executing them
might overthrow the immense pillar,
and prove disastrous to the work, and
fatal perhaps to scores of lives. In
view of the emergency, a kind of military
law was proclaimed, whereby all
lookers-on were to keep silence, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
penalty of death. Fontana, standing
aloft, gave his orders, the wheels were
turned, the ropes tightened, the mighty
mass slowly moved on, the pedestal
was reached. The obelisk was lifted
up. Hours rolled on, and still it rose
gradually but truly. At length it stood
within a few feet of its destined position.
But it would go no farther.
The ropes, bearing the strain of the
weight for so many hours, had stretched,
and some were threatening to
snap. Fontana stood pale and speechless
at the impending disaster, which
he now saw no way of averting. Suddenly
a clear, manly voice was heard
from out of the crowd, "<i>Wet your
ropes! wet your ropes!</i>" Fontana at
once seized the happy thought. The
ropes were wetted, swelled and contracted
to their original state, and
soon the huge obelisk stood upright
and firm on the solid pedestal, and
the daring work was crowned with
complete success. Meanwhile, the
officers had seized the man that cried
out; he was brought before the pope,
who thanked him and embraced him.
He was asked who he was, and what
reward he desired. His name was
Bresca, a sailor from San Remo, near
Nice. His family owned a palm-grove
there, and the reward he asked
was the privilege of supplying St.
Peter's every year for ever with the
palm-branches to be blessed and used
on Palm-Sunday. It was granted.
Nearly three centuries have passed, but
the family of Bresca is still at San
Remo, has still palm-groves, and
every year there comes a small vessel
from that port, laden with the palm-branches
for St. Peter's. May it
continue to come three hundred years
hence!</p>

<p>The holy father, in that clear, sweet,
and majestic voice, for which he is
remarkable, chanted the prayers for
the blessing of the palms. To the
blessing succeeded the distribution.
One after another, the cardinals gravely
advanced, the long silk trains of
their robes rustling on the carpet as
they moved forward; each one received
a palm-branch; the oriental patriarchs,
the primates, and a number of
the archbishops and bishops, as representatives
of their brethren, followed
after the cardinals, and received each
his branch. Meanwhile the choir was
singing the exquisite anthems, "Pueri
HebrÃ¦orum," appointed for that occasion.
It was a simple, yet a most
effective and thrilling scene. The
cardinals stood in their long line, the
rich gold ornamentation of their chasubles
shining brightly on the violet
silk, on their heads the mitre or the
red <i>calotte</i> of their rank. Before
each one stood his chaplain in dark
purple, holding the decorated palm-branch,
like a lance. In the middle,
as the lines of Oriental and Latin
prelates in their rich and varied robes
approached the holy father, or retired,
each one bearing his palm-branch,
there was a perpetual changing and
shifting and intermingling of colors,
as in a kaleidoscope. Near the pope,
stood the senator and other civil
officers of Rome, in their mediÃ¦val
mantles. The Swiss guard, in a military
dress of broad stripes, red and
yellow, or black and yellow, some
of them wearing steel corselets and
breastplates, and all wearing the
plumed Tyrolean military hat; they
stood motionless as statues, holding
their bright halberds upright. The
Noble Guard, in their rich uniform,
stood here and there; and on both
sides, line after line of bishops, robed
in cappa magnas, formed a massive
and imposing background. Add to all
these, the religious orders, Carmelites,
Dominicans, Franciscans of every family,
Augustinians, Benedictines, Cistercians,
Canons Regular, Theatines,
Servites, Crociferi, and many others,
each in the costume of his order or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
congregation, and all bearing branches
of blessed palm. Add still the continuous
chanting of those unrivalled
voices and the indistinct bass murmur
or rustling of the vast crowd. It was
a scene which carried one away. You
did not strive to catch every note of
Palestrina's beautiful composition. It
was enough to drink in the sound.
You scarcely thought of reciting the
words of a prayer&mdash;there are none
assigned for the time of distribution
specifically&mdash;you found it easier to indulge
a train of devotional thought,
and to unite with it something of
pious admiration.</p>

<p>Next followed the procession in
commemoration of the solemn entry
of our Saviour into Jerusalem, five
days before his Passion. Leaving
the sanctuary, the long lines of singers,
of the religious orders, of bishops
and prelates, and of cardinals,
and finally the pope with his attendants,
passed down the nave of the
church, out by one door into the
vestibule, and, returning by another
into the church, again came up the
nave and entered the sanctuary.
The strains of the "Gloria, Laus, et
Honor," the hymn for that procession,
always beautiful, and infinitely
more so when sung to-day by
this choir, swelled as the procession
approached you, became fainter
and sweeter as it passed on.
You caught but a faint murmur of
melody while they were in the vestibule,
and the notes rose again as
the procession entered the church
and moved slowly onward to the
sanctuary.</p>

<p>Then came the high mass, which
an archbishop celebrated, by special
permission, at the high-altar. Without
such permission, no one save
the holy father himself celebrates
there. During this mass the entire
history of the Passion of our Lord,
as given in the Gospel of St. Matthew,
is sung. On Good-Friday,
the same history is sung, as given
by St. John. Perhaps no portion
of the chants of the church in use
at the present day is as ancient and
venerable as the mode in which the
Passion is chanted. The old classic
Greek style is preserved, and, fundamentally
at least, the melody must
be Grecian, although perhaps somewhat
changed to suit our modern
gamut. The ordinary mode is to
distribute the whole among three
singers, one of whom chants all the
narrative or historical portion. Whenever
the Saviour speaks, a second
singer chants his words. A third
singer comes in at the proper times
to chant whatever is said by others.
In the Sixtine chapel, and here in
St. Peter's to-day, there is a slight
change made, which from its appropriateness
and effective character we
cannot but look on as in part, at
least, a return toward the original
idea of such a chant. One singer,
an exquisite tenor, took up the narrative
portion in a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">recitativo</i>, closing
each sentence with the modulations
with which many of our readers
must be well acquainted. A baritone
voice, one of the richest, smoothest,
most majestic, and most plaintive
and sympathetic we ever heard,
chanted the Saviour's part. There
was not in it a note that we had not
heard before scores of times, but
never as they were now chanted.
One could, it seemed, listen to him
for ever; when he closed one sentence,
your eye ran along the page
to mark the verse, at which you
would hear him again. As he uttered
the words, you drank them
in, in their sense rather than in the
music, realizing something of their
pathos and majesty. It was as if
in truth you stood near him in Gethsemane,
before Annas, and Caiaphas,
before Pilate; as if you walked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
him along the sorrowful way, as if
you stood so near the cross on Calvary
that every word he spoke, every
tone of his voice, entered your heart.
Years cannot efface from our minds
the memory of that wondrous chant.
It seems still to ring in our ears.
The portions usually assigned to a
third singer are here distributed
among several, who chant singly, or
together, as the words are spoken
by one, or by several, or by a multitude.
Thus, a soprano and a contralto
unite to sing the words of the
two false witnesses. The mutual
contradiction of the witnesses is indicated
by the irregularity of the time,
and the discords that are repeatedly
introduced. When the crowd
cries out, "<i>Away with him; crucify
him; we will have no king but CÃ¦sar</i>,"
the whole choir bursts forth.
You hear the trembling shrill tones
of age, the hissing words of irate
manhood, the shrill trebles of excited
women, the full incisive words of
the priests, and the clamors of the
unthinking rabble. When they cry,
"<i>His blood be upon us and upon
our children</i>," the voices, full at the
beginning, grow tremulous and weaker
as they proceed, and some are
silent, as if reluctant to pronounce
the terrible words of the imprecation.
And when the soldiers, after scourging
the Saviour, and putting on his
head the crown of thorns, place the
reed in his hands and kneel before
him, saluting him, <i>Hail, King of the
Jews</i>, the words are sung by three
or four voices with a softness, a sweetness,
and an earnestness which would
make you think that, for the moment,
and in spite of themselves,
they felt the divine truth of the words
they intended to utter in mockery.</p>

<p>In the entire cycle of music there
is nothing so sublime and so touching
as the Passion of our Lord, sung
by the papal choir in St. Peter's.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, in Holy-Week, a general
congregation of the council was
held in the usual form. As we stated in
our last number, the fathers voted on
the entire draught, then before them,
either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placet</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placet juxta modum</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non placet</i>. We need add nothing to
the account we then gave.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
afternoons the bishops attended in
St. Peter's at the office of the TenebrÃ¦.
On each occasion, twenty-five or thirty
thousand persons about half-filled
the church, to hear the lamentations,
and, above all, the far-famed Misereres
heretofore only to be heard in
the Sixtine chapel.</p>

<p>The papal choir is composed of
about twenty-five singers. Basses,
baritones, contraltos, tenors, and sopranos,
all chosen voices of the first
quality, and all trained for years in
the special style of singing of this
choir, different from that of any other
we ever heard, and in the peculiar
traditions as to the precise style in
which each of their principal pieces
should be executed. They say themselves,
that without this special training
the mere notes of the score would
by no means suffice to guide another
choir, at least so as to produce the
marvellous effects which they attain.
They have in their repertory over forty
Misereres, composed by their different
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">maestri</i>, or chiefs, during the last
three centuries. Not more than four
of these are placed by them in the
first rank. On Wednesday, that by
Baini was sung; on Thursday, that
of Allegri, and on Friday, one by
Mustafa, the present leader of the
choir.</p>

<p>That of Allegri is acknowledged
to be the best. He was born in Rome
in 1560, and became a celebrated
composer and singer. In 1629, he
entered this choir, at the age of sixty-nine,
and was its leader for twenty-three
years, dying in 1652 at the ripe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
age of ninety-two. His Miserere is
of such incontestable merit that it is
always one of the three sung each
year, and not unfrequently it has been
sung twice in the same year.</p>

<p>Baini was born in Rome in 1775,
entered the papal choir at about the
age of thirty, became <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">maestro</i> or leader
in 1824, and died about twenty
years ago. He was the most learned
musical scholar of Italy in his day,
and published a number of works.
As a composer, he ranked very high.
His Miserere is esteemed next to that
of Allegri. There is a difference between
them. The older composer
was filled with a sense of the full
meaning of the psalm as a whole, and
varies the expression in each verse
according to the sense of the entire
verse. Baini, on the contrary, is disposed
to dwell on the special sense of
each word and minor phrase, bringing
these points into higher relief than
Allegri would. To many, on this account,
his Miserere is more intelligible
and more pleasing than the other.
But a longer familiarity with both
invariably reverses this decision.</p>

<p>Mustafa, the present <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">maestro</i> of the
papal choir, was likewise born in
Rome, and entered the choir thirty
years ago, as a soprano singer. On
Baini's death, he succeeded to his
post. No one in Italy has a more
thorough and scientific knowledge of
vocal music than he has; and his
compositions are among the choicest
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morceaux</i> of the choir here. His
Miserere has several advantages. It
was written for the voices now in the
choir, and its execution is directed
by the composer himself. There is
more of the modern style about it
than we find in the other two. Hence
it is always most pleasing, for style,
and the precision and brilliancy with
which it is sung.</p>

<p>But besides the artistic excellence
which the few trained to analyze and
examine such compositions can alone
discover and discuss suitably, there
is a something about these Misereres
which all can feel, and which is far more
religious in its character. Once enjoyed,
it is never forgotten. As the long
office of matins and lauds is slowly
chanted, psalm succeeding psalm, and
lamentation following lamentation,
the lighted candles on the triangular
candelabrum are all gradually extinguished,
save one, and then, one by
one, those on the altar. The shades
of evening are coming on. The light
of day has become almost a twilight,
adding a mysterious indefiniteness to
the immensity of the vast edifice. Only
through the glory, or circular stained
window in the apsis of the basilica,
there comes in a golden light from the
western sky. The cardinals and bishops
are all kneeling in their places,
the multitude of twenty-five thousand
that have waited two hours for this
moment are hushed to deadest silence.
A wailing voice is heard&mdash;faint, sad, almost
bursting into sobs&mdash;<i>Have mercy
on me, O God!</i> Another and another
joins in the entreating cry. It swells
and rises, sometimes in passionate,
loud supplication, sometimes lowered
to broken tones, scarce daring to hope,
until an angel voice leads on, <i>According
to thy great mercy</i>. Verse after
verse the wailing, pleading prayer continues,
in combinations of matchless
voices, and in harmonious strains
never heard or dreamed of before.
The multitude listen, suppressing
their breathing lest they may lose a
single one of the silvery tones. Some
are kneeling, others who have not room
to kneel, in that closely packed crowd,
stand with their heads sunk on their
breasts. All are silent, yet many a
moving lip tells you they are repeating
the words with the singers, that
they may more fully drink in the
sense and the appropriateness of the
music. When the last verse closes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
there is a sigh, as if they waked from
a trance and found themselves in this
life again.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
there were the usual services in
St. Peter's, in the forenoon. On the
first day, the bishops were required to
attend in white copes and mitres. A
cardinal sang high-mass, after which
came the usual procession of the blessed
sacrament, which is conveyed from
the main altar to a repository prepared
to receive it. This year the chapel
of the canons was used for the
purpose. Cross and candles and incense
led the way. The canons and
beneficiaries and other clergy of St.
Peter's followed, each one bearing a
lighted waxen candle, and responding
to the chanted hymns of the choir.
A certain number of archbishops and
primates came next, and after them
the cardinals, all likewise with their
lighted tapers. The pontiff himself
bore the blessed sacrament, under a
rich canopy of gold cloth, upheld on
eight staffs of silver gilt, borne by his
attendants. Cardinals and clergy,
Swiss Guard and Noble Guard, walked
slowly on either side; the heads
of religious orders followed, bearing
their lights; and after them, not two
and two, as the regular procession had
walked, but more closely pressed together,
came the hundreds of bishops.
The church, at least the half of it toward
the altar, was packed and jammed.
Not without some effort had
the Swiss and the lines of soldiers kept
a small passage-way clear for the procession
from the main altar to the chapel
of the canons. As the sound of
the well-known hymn, the "Pange lingua,"
was recognized, and the procession
started, all who could knelt;
those who had not room to do so
bowed reverently until the pontiff had
passed and had entered the chapel,
and the amen of the closing prayer
rang through the church.</p>

<p>At once there was a rushing to and
fro of the thirty thousand people in
the church, one half seeking to pass
out to the square in front or to ascend
to the broad summit of the colonnade
on each side of it; for the
pontiff would, in a few minutes, give
the solemn pontifical blessing from the
loggia or balcony over the main door
of St. Peter's. The other half took
the occasion to occupy the vacant
space closer to the main altar, striving
to secure the best positions, from
which to witness, as well as they
could, the ceremonies to follow in the
sanctuary, after the blessing, and trusting
that on Easter-Sunday they might
be able to behold and to receive the
blessing with grander ceremonial than
to-day. The holy father and the cardinals
came forth from the chapel,
and, leaving for a time the basilica by
a side-door, passed into the Vatican
palace, and from thence to the vast
hall immediately over the vestibule
of St. Peter's. Borne in his curule
chair, he advances to the loggia, or
open balcony projecting in the middle
toward the square, and looks out on
the city, and on the thousands below,
that kneel as he stands erect, and, raising
both arms aloft toward heaven,
calls down on them the blessing of
God the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost. The solemn and sweet
tones of that majestic voice ring
through the square, and the words are
heard distinctly by the multitudes.
A cardinal reads and publishes the indulgence,
and the pontiff and the cardinals
retire.</p>

<p>Back into the church the mass of
people come, a living torrent. In
twenty minutes the cardinals and the
bishops are again in the sanctuary,
while the movement and rustling of
the moving and struggling crowd fills
the church with the sound as of a deep,
continuous, and subdued bass note.
At one side of the large sanctuary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
which is about one hundred and thirty
feet deep, and seventy-five feet broad,
an ascent of eight or ten steps leads
to a broad platform visible to all. On
this platform attendants move about,
preparing all that is necessary for the
next portion of the ceremony, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mandatum</i>, or washing of feet. Soon
a line of thirteen figures, dressed as
pilgrims in long white woollen robes
reaching to the instep, ascend to the
platform, and the attendants conduct
them to the seats that are prepared.
They are priests from abroad who
have come to Rome and all eyes are
turned to inspect them as they stand
ranged in a line. One is an old man
stooped with age, with large, piercing
dark eyes, and heavy eyebrows, long
aquiline nose and high cheek-bones,
and ruddy cheeks. The olive tint of
his skin looks darker by contrast with
his ample flowing beard of patriarchal
whiteness. He is from the east. Perhaps
those two other younger ones,
with full black beards, are from the
east likewise. To judge by his almond
eye, the long and regular features,
and the darkish skin, another
was an Egyptian. Of a fifth there
could be no mistake. He was from
Senegambia in Africa, and his surname
was <i>Zamba</i>, or, as we call it in America,
<i>Sambo</i>. His jet black skin, his
negro features, the blue spectacles he
wore, and his instinctive attitude of
dignity made him the most conspicuous
in the number. They entered,
wearing tall white caps, in shape
something like stove-pipe hats without
any rim, and with a tuft on the summit;
long white dresses of the shape
you may see in the miniatures of illuminated
manuscripts written a thousand
years ago; and even, their stockings
and shoes were white as their
dress. As all were ready, the pontiff
enters, and the choir intones the antiphon,
"Mandatum novum"&mdash;"A new
command I give you." Some preliminary
prayers are chanted, and the pontiff,
putting off the cope, but retaining
his mitre, is girded with an apron, and
ascends the platform. An attendant
unlaces the shoe on the right foot of
the first pilgrim, and lets down the
stocking. Other attendants present
the ewer of water and the towels; the
pontiff, stooping down or kneeling,
washes the instep, dries it with a towel,
and kisses it. While the attendants
raise the stocking and lace the shoe,
the holy father gives to the pilgrim a
large nosegay, which in former times
contained a coin to aid him on his
journey homeward. He did the same
one by one to all of them. During
this touching ceremony the choir continued
to sing anthem after anthem;
but few present did more than listen
vaguely and enjoy the sound, so preoccupied,
or rather so fascinated, all
seemed to be by a ceremony so rarely
used in the church, and so fully recalling
our divine Saviour's act and instruction
before the Last Supper.
Few have ever seen it in church, save
as to-day here in St. Peter's, on Holy-Thursday.
It may be said to be carried
out, too, on a larger scale and in
a practical way, all these days in
Rome. There is a large institution
here called <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Santissima TrinitÃ  dei
Pellegrini</i>, where, during Holy-Week,
thousands of poor pilgrims, who have
come on foot, and reach Rome weary
and foot-sore, are received, and supplied
with two meals a day and beds
for three days and nights. There is
one department for the men, and another
for the women and children.
Each evening, after the conclusion of
the services in the churches, they return
to the institution. Cardinals, bishops,
priests, and laymen in numbers,
nobles and private individuals,
are there, and wash their feet (thoroughly)
and wait on them at the
table. In the female department
princesses, duchesses, and ladies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
every degree and station, titled and
untitled, are there to perform the
same offices for the women and children.
All these ladies belong to several
charitable confraternities and associations
in the city; and by one of
their rules no one of them is allowed
the privilege of uniting in this work
in Holy-Week unless she has, during
the past year, paid at least a stated
number of charitable visits to the prisons
and hospitals. We do not know
whether the men have the same admirable
rule.</p>

<p>After the washing of the feet in St.
Peter's, the pope retired, and the pilgrims
followed. The services in the
church itself were over. But there
was something else, which as many as
could wished to see. The pope was
to serve the pilgrims at table. In the
large hall mentioned above as being
situated over the vestibule of the
church, and from which the pope
went out to the loggia to give the
blessing, a long table had been prepared
and decorated. Soon the pilgrims
entered and stood at their
places; and the hall was filled with
thousands of spectators. The pontiff
came in, attended by three or four
cardinals, his own attendants, and a
number of bishops. He said the
grace, and a monsignore read a portion
of the Scriptures, and then continued
to read a book of sermons.
Meanwhile, the pope was passing to
and fro, from one end of the table to
the other, helping each one to soup,
to fish, and to wine; and finally, giving
them his special blessing, he retired.
The services had commenced at
nine <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> It was now two <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span></p>

<p>The holy oils were blessed, not in
St. Peter's, but in St. John Lateran's;
for St. Peter's is the cathedral of the
pope as Pope and Bishop of the Catholic
Church. St. John's is his cathedral
as Bishop of Rome.</p>

<p>On Friday morning the offices in
St. Peter's were precisely the same as
in every other cathedral, differing only
in the presence of the sovereign pontiff
and the cardinals, and the large
number of bishops, who attended robed
in purple <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cappa magna</i>. The "Improperia,"
sung while the pope, the cardinals,
and the bishops approached to
kneel and kiss the cross, is accounted
the master-piece of Palestrina. It is
unequalled in its expression of tenderness
and of sorrowful reproach. Sung
as it was by that unrivalled choir, on
this day, when the church is desolate
and stripped of all ornament, and the
ministers at the altar are robed in
sombre black; when burning lights
and the smoke of incense are banished
from the sanctuary; when one thing
only is presented&mdash;the image of the
crucified Redeemer; one theme only
fills prayers, anthems, and hymns alike&mdash;the
sorrows and death of our Lord
on Calvary&mdash;its effect seemed overpowering.
You thought not of the
wondrous charm of the voices; you
heeded not the antique melody or the
skilful harmonies, as word after word,
clearly and distinctly uttered, fell on
your ear; the music but rendered more
clear and emphatic their sense as it
sunk into your heart. You felt that
the reproaches of the loving and forgiving
Saviour were addressed to you
personally, and you bowed in sorrowful
confusion as well as in adoration,
while you saluted him in the words
of early Christian worship, <span class="smcap">Agios o
Theos</span>.</p>

<p>During the service, that portion of
his Gospel in which St. John narrates
the history of the Passion, was chanted
in the same manner as had been
the narration by St. Matthew on the
preceding Sunday. Prepared as all
were, by the services of the days past
and by the sublime "Improperia" we
had just heard, words cannot express
the awe which came on them as they
listened to this vivid recitation in music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
of that grand drama of Good-Friday
on the summit of Calvary. It is
on such occasions, and with singing
like this, that one realizes what force
and truth and majesty there is in perfect
music, inspired and consecrated
by religion.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the bishops were divided
between St. Peter's and St.
John's. In the latter church, besides
the usual services, there were also the
instruction of catechumens, the baptism
of converts with the form for
grown persons, and at the mass a
grand ordination, at which tonsure, all
the minor orders, subdeaconship, deaconship,
and priesthood were conferred
on those who had been examined
and found worthy of the grades to
which they aspired. In all, they were
about sixty.</p>

<p>In St. Peter's, the services were
only the usual ones of the church for
this day&mdash;the blessing of the font, the
chanting of the prophecies, the blessing
of the paschal candle, and the
solemn high-mass celebrated by a
cardinal. The pope was present. One
would have thought that, at his age,
after the fatigues of the days past,
and in view of the long functions of
the morrow, it would be proper that
he should have one day of quiet, or
at least of comparative quiet. But
Pius IX. never thinks of sparing himself.
Many of the bishops were at
St. John's. But those who were in
St. Peter's heard the grand mass
"of Pope Marcellus," as it is called,
by Palestrina. This is the mass
which was composed and sung in
1565, and which, it is said, won from
the pope and cardinals the reversal
of an absolute prohibition they had
almost determined on, of all music
and singing in church save the
Gregorian chant, on account of the
bad taste and abuses of musicians
and singers, who introduced profane
and worldly music even into the
mass. No one who heard those
grand religious choral strains could
fail to see how solemnly, and fully,
and appropriately they expressed in
music the sublime character of the
service. Such music does not distract;
on the contrary, it fixes the
thoughts, and soothes and guides the
feelings into a channel of devotion.
It would have been impossible for
the cardinals, after listening to this
exquisite mass, to arrive at a different
conclusion.</p>

<p>From Thursday until Saturday, all
the bells of Rome had been silent.
There was a visible shade of sorrow
on the city, a public grief, as it were,
for the tragedy of Calvary. But in
view of the joyous resurrection close
at hand, this silence of sorrow is soon
to pass away. It was near eleven
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> when the high-mass commenced
at St. Peter's. At the Gloria, a signal
was given, and the gigantic Bourdon
and the other bells of the basilica
broke into a grand peal. The guns
of St. Angelo answered, and, quick
as sound could travel, all the thousand
bells of all the steeples and
belfrys of Rome, without exception,
joined in the clamorous yet not unpleasant
or unmusical chorus. The
rooks, and ravens, and doves, and
swallows flew to and fro, frightened
from their nests, half-stunned, and
utterly distracted. When the pealing
chorus ended&mdash;and it lasted for a full
half-hour&mdash;Rome had put off her sadness,
and friends were exchanging the
happy salutations of Easter.</p>

<p>In the afternoon an Armenian
bishop celebrated high-mass, according
to their rite, at four <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> in one
church, and, at the same hour, a
Chaldean prelate celebrated high-mass,
according to his rite, in another.
In the earlier centuries, this mass of
the resurrection was celebrated by
all after midnight, on Saturday night.
The Orientals have brought it forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
to Saturday afternoon; the Latins
have gradually advanced it to
the forenoon. Sunday dawned, a
bright, clear, pleasant, cloudless Italian
spring day. At an early hour
carriages of every kind were pouring
in long lines over every bridge across
the Tiber, and hurrying on to St.
Peter's, and tens of thousands were
making their way thither on foot.
By nine o'clock, the sanctuary is
filled with bishops robed in white
copes and mitres, and with cardinals
in richly adorned white chasubles.
Soon the Swiss Guard take their
places, and the Noble Guard appear
in their richest uniform. Lines of
Pontifical Zouaves and the Legion of
Antibes, and other soldiers, keep a
lane open up the middle of the
church, through the immense crowd
of, it was estimated, forty thousand
persons, from the door of the sanctuary.
One tribune on the south
side of the sanctuary was filled with
members of various royal families now
in Rome, some on a visit, some staying
here permanently. On the other
side was a tribune for the diplomatic
corps, which was filled with ambassadors,
ministers resident and envoys,
in their rich uniforms and covered
with jewelled decorations.</p>

<p>A burst from the band of silver
trumpets over the doorway of the
church told us that the holy father
was entering. Down the lane through
the vast crowd might be seen the
cross slowly advancing. Then was
heard the voice of the choir of the
canons, welcoming the pontiff to the
basilica, and then aloft, higher than
the mass that filled the church, he
was seen slowly borne on in the curule
chair, robed in a rich cope of
white silk, heavy with gold embroidery
and wearing the tiara. Slowly
advancing, and giving his blessing to
the multitudes on either side, he
reached the chapel of the blessed
sacrament, descended from the chair,
and, with the cardinals accompanying
him, and his other attendants,
knelt for some moments in adoration.
Then, rising, he ascended the chair
again, and the procession pursued its
way through the crowd, now more
closely packed than ever, to the sanctuary.
Here the pontiff descended
again to his robing throne at the
epistle side of the altar. The choir
commence the chanting of the psalms
of terce and sext. Meanwhile the
pontiff was robed for mass, and the
cardinals, the patriarchs, and primates,
and a certain number of the
archbishops and bishops, as representatives
of their brethren, paid him
the usual homage. This over, solemn
high-mass commenced in the
usual form. After incensing the altar
at the Introit, he passed to his regular
throne at the end of the sanctuary,
just opposite the altar, and fully
one hundred and twenty feet distant.
There beside him stood a cardinal
priest and two cardinal deacons; the
senator of Rome, in his official robes
and cloak of yellow and gold, with
his pages of similar costume, the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">conservatori</i> of the city; and on the
steps, around the throne, stood, or
were seated, some twenty assistant
bishops; on either side six lines of
seats stretching down to the altar
were occupied by the cardinals and
by a great mass of prelates, Latin
and Oriental, all in the richest vestments
appropriate to this the greatest
festival of the church.</p>

<p>Never was solemn high-mass celebrated
with more splendor in St. Peter's
than on this Easter-Sunday. To be
privileged to assist at it amply repays
many a one for all the time and all the
fatigue of a journey to Rome. The
holy father officiates with a fervor and
intense devotion which lights up his
countenance. The venerable Cardinal
Patrizi, who stood by his side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
was the very personification of sacerdotal
dignity. The mitred prelates
in their places, many of them gray-haired
or bald, or bent with age and
labors, seemed radiant with the holy
joy of the occasion. The masters of
ceremony and the attendants moved
gravely and reverently, as their duties
called them from one part of
the sanctuary to another. Even the
vast crowd of forty or fifty thousand
that filled the church were penetrated
with reverent awe, and sank almost
into perfect stillness. Nothing was
heard save the noble voice of the
sovereign pontiff chanting the prayers,
and the responding strains of the
choir. Yet, in comparison with the
music we had heard during the week,
the Gloria and the Creed, super-excellent
though they were, seemed in
some measure to belong to the earth.
After the subdeacon had sung the
epistle in Latin, a Greek subdeacon,
in the robes of his Greek rite, sung it
in Greek; and similarly a Greek deacon
followed the Latin deacon in
chanting the Gospel. A musical antiquarian
would have found in the
peculiar modulations of their chant
traces of the ancient eastern style of
music, going back, perhaps, in those
unchanging people to the days of
Greek classic civilization. The most
impressive moment in the mass was
certainly the elevation. At a signal,
you heard the voice of the officers
giving the command, and the thud
on the floor as the companies of soldiers
simultaneously grounded arms,
and every man sank on one knee.
The Noble Guard, too, sank on one
knee, uncovered their heads, and saluted
with their bright swords. The
Swiss Guard stood erect and presented
arms. In the sanctuary, of
course, all were kneeling. There
was a sound like the rushing of a wind
through a pine forest as the vast
multitude strove to sink down too.
And then came a dead silence over
all. As the pontiff raised aloft the
sacred host, turning toward every
quarter of the church, there came,
faint, and soft, and solemn at first,
and gradually stronger and more emphatic,
the thrilling tones of those
silver trumpets placed over the doorway
and out of sight. Their slow,
majestic melody, and their rich accords,
and the repeated and prolonged
echoes of those notes of almost supernatural
sweetness, from chapels
and nave and dome, produced an
effect that was marvellously impressive.
As if fascinated by them, no
one moved from his kneeling position,
or even raised his head, until the
last note of the strain and its receding
echoes had died away, and the
choir went on to intone the "Benedictus
qui venit."</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the mass, the
pope unrobed, put on his cope and
tiara again, and retired in the same
manner as he had entered. At once
the vast mass of people began to pour
forth from St. Peter's, to make their
way to the front; for the pope would
soon give his solemn benediction
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">urbi et orbi</i>&mdash;to Rome and to the
world. We have already described
the square before St. Peter's. It is
about fifteen hundred feet long, and
averages nearly four hundred feet in
breadth. All during the mass it had
been gradually filling up, and when
now new torrents of men came pouring
out of the church, the whole place
became so packed that one standing
on the lofty colonnade on the side of
the Vatican and looking down on the
square, perceived that only here and
there even small portions of the
ground remained visible, such was
the closeness with which men and
women stood packed together. Especially
was this true on the vast
esplanades more immediately before
the church, and the broad steps leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
up to it. Here were gathered
all who wished to be as near as possible
to the pope during the blessing,
or to get a sight from this elevation
of the vast basin of the square thoroughly
packed with human beings.
Nor was the multitude confined to
the square alone; on the colonnades,
on either hand, stood thousands and
thousands, as in favored positions.
Every window and balcony looking
out on the square was thronged.
Every roof had its group, and away
down the two streets leading up the
square from the bridge of St. Angelo
the crowd appeared equally dense.
A military man present, whose experience
had qualified him to estimate
large masses, judged that there were
present at least one hundred and
twenty thousand persons. Mingling
among them, you heard every language
of Europe, many of Asia, and,
it was said, half a dozen from Africa.
It was a representation of the world
which the pontiff would bless. From
all this multitude, standing in the
bright sunlight, which a north wind
rendered not disagreeable, came up
a roar, as it were, of rushing waters,
mingling the hum of so many voices
with the blaring of an occasional
military trumpet from the troops, and
the neighing of horses.</p>

<p>Soon the regimental bands are
heard to salute the approach of his
holiness, invisible as yet to the crowd.
A score of mitred prelates appear at
the large Balcony of the Blessing.
They look out in wonder and admiration
at the scene below, and retire
to allow another score to view it; a
third group does the same. These
are the bishops who have accompanied
the pope from the sanctuary to
the Vatican, and from the Vatican
hither. Of the others, some are
down on the square with the people,
more are on the colonnades, in places
reserved for them. After the bishops,
the cardinals are seen to fill the balcony
once or twice, and then the
pontiff himself comes in view, borne
forward on his curule chair. He is
out on the loggia itself. Ordinarily,
besides the ornamental drapery which
we see decorating the columns and
architrave and tympanum, and the
railing in front, there projects overhead
a large awning to screen him
from the sun. But to-day the north
wind does not allow it to stand. Fortunately,
the weather hardly calls for
it. He is scarcely inconvenienced
by the rays of the sun as they are reflected
from his rich gold-cloth mitre,
studded with precious stones, and
from the massive gold embroidery of
his cope. The military music has
ceased, and there is the silence of awe
and of earnest expectation. Those
that are near hear the tones of some
one chanting the Confiteor beside the
pontiff. Two bishops hold the large
missal from which he chants the
prayers in a clear, rotund, and musical
voice. The people are kneeling, and
twice is heard the response of united
thousands&mdash;<i>Amen</i>. The book is laid
aside. The pontiff rises and stands
erect, looks up to heaven, and, with a
majestic sweeping motion, opens wide
his arms and invokes on all the blessing
of heaven. His voice is given
forth in its very fullest power, and
even at the furthermost end of the
square the kneeling crowd sign themselves
with the sign of the cross as
they distinctly hear the words: "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Benedictio
Dei omnipotentis, Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti, descendat super vos
et maneat semper." May the blessing
of Almighty God, the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, descend upon you
and abide with you for ever.</i> And
there came up a swelling <i>Amen</i>. As
the pontiff sank back on his chair, the
kneeling crowd arose, and there burst
forth from every portion of it a loud
acclaim of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vivas</i>, of good wishes, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
acclamations, that died away only as
the pontiff retired from view, and as
the cannon of St. Angelo commenced
the national salute.</p>

<p>It was a ceremony fitted by its majesty
and its magnificence to close the
grand ceremonies of Easter-Week.
Art cannot do justice to it. Painting,
tied down by the laws of perspective,
cannot portray what the eye sees on
every side, and does not pretend to
give the words of solemn prayer, of
impressive benediction, and the outburst
of acclamation which we heard.
Words must fail to convey the emotions
that filled thousands of hearts
that day, at the sublime and moving
spectacle. It was a sensible testimony
of the holiness, the authority,
and the unity of the church of Christ,
a testimony to which not even an unbeliever,
if present, could remain indifferent.</p>

<p>It took nearly two hours for that
crowd to depart. The cardinals, royalty,
the nobles, and many of the
bishops in carriages, made their way,
at a snail's pace, along the streets
leading to the old Roman Elian
Bridge across the Tiber, now known
as the Bridge of St. Angelo. They
could scarcely get on as fast as the
foot passengers that filled the street
on either side up to the very wheels
of the single line of carriages allowed.
Others, more in a hurry, went out by
the Porta Angelica, so as to cross the
Tiber at the Ponte Molle, two miles
north of the city, and then reÃ«nter by
the Porta del Popolo; and others again
turned southward, following the streets
along the river, and crossing it at the
suspension bridge, or at some of the
bridges lower down. And so, within
two hours, all reached their homes
without a single accident, without a
single quarrel, without a single call
for the interference of the police.</p>

<p>But it was for many of them only
to return within a few hours. On
Easter-Sunday evening occurs the
grand illumination of the faÃ§ade and
dome of St. Peter's. As the shades
of evening fell on the city, silvery
lights began to mark the lofty cross,
and to glow along the huge ribs of
the mighty dome, and to map out the
lines of the windows and doors, the
columns, and cornices, and tympanums,
and architectural ornaments
and projections, to illuminate the
clock-faces and the coats of arms
above them, to sparkle along the
minor domes, and to stretch away on
either side in regular lines along each
colonnade, diffusing everywhere a
gentle light, and bringing into prominence,
with a fairy-like witchery, all
the lines of the pile before you. There
are about five thousand two hundred
of these lights. They are made of
broad shallow plates of metal or
earthenware, containing a certain
amount of prepared tallow and a
lighted wick, and surrounded by a
cylinder of paper, colored and figured.
From this lantern, as it may be called,
the light comes diffused, subdued, and
white; hence the Romans call this
the <i>silver</i> illumination. The square
was filled, though by no means as
in the morning, with crowds looking,
wondering, and admiring. At a quarter
past eight, the large bell of St.
Peter's began to chime. As the very
first stroke came to our ears, a tiny
blaze was seen to dart up a guiding
wire to the top of the lofty cross, and
a clear bright flame burst forth, glowed
on the summit; downward the tiny
flame flew, lighting two others on each
arm of the cross, and then downward
lighting still others along the stem.
Invisible hands caused other such
little flames to flit rapidly hither and
thither, like glow-moths, all along the
dome, the front, and both colonnades
around the square. Wherever they
seemed to alight for an instant, there
a bright flame sprung into existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
In just twenty-three seconds, and long
before the clock had half struck the
hour, eight hundred of those bright
yellow flames had almost eclipsed the
first ones, and the building stood forth
in the <i>golden</i> illumination. It was a
sight, once seen, never to be forgotten.
Whoever first conceived the
idea of this instantaneous change of
illumination was a poet in the truest
sense of the word.</p>

<p>On Easter-Monday evening, the
festive celebrations were continued by
giving the <i>Girandola</i>, or exhibition of
fireworks on Monte Pincio. On entering
Rome from the north, by the
Porta del Popolo, as before the days
of the railways the great majority of
travellers did, you find yourself at
once in a large oval square, called the
Piazza del Popolo, in the centre of
which stands an ancient Egyptian
obelisk, its base surrounded by modern
Egyptian lions and fountains.
On the south side, three streets radiate
into the heart of the city. For
a wonder, they are straight; you may
look down the central one, the Corso,
for full three quarters of a mile. Massive
palatial buildings stand around
this square; to the west there rises a
line of lofty evergreen cypresses, near
the Tiber. Through the interstices
of their branches and dark foliage
you may catch glimpses of St. Peter's.
On the east rises the Pincian Hill,
the <i>Mons Hortulanus</i> of the olden
Romans, then outside and to the
north of the city, now within its walls,
and forming its beautiful promenade.
The hill is about one hundred and
fifty feet high, and toward the square
is quite steep. Broad carriage-ways,
sweeping from right to left, in zigzag
courses, give access from the square
to the promenade above; and immense
walls of masonry, with arches
and porticos, and columns, rising in
stories, back of and above each other,
prevent any landslides, and give an
architectural finish to the whole hill-face
which the trees and exotic plants
growing in the spaces between only
embellish and do not mar.</p>

<p>For ten days before Easter-Monday,
the public had been excluded from
the promenade. As they passed
through the square, they could see a
lofty scaffolding in the process of
erection on the brow of the hill, and
other scaffolding interlacing with the
architecture of its side. The opposite
oval curve of the square was occupied
by a line of covered galleries
of wood erected for the occasion. On
this Monday night, the air was balmy,
the sky clear but moonless. At least
twenty-five thousand spectators stood
in the square. The Roman municipality
had assigned the galleries to
the bishops and some thousands of
other invited guests. Four military
bands whiled away the time of expectation
with sweet music. At last
the appointed hour struck on a neighboring
church clock, and a rocket
shot up into the air, the sound of its
explosion was reÃ«choed from the
mouth of a cannon; and the pyrotechnic
display at once commenced.
The art of pyrotechnics has been cultivated
at Rome with more skill and
good taste than in any other city of
Europe. We might, indeed, expect
this from a people trained as no other
is to recognize and appreciate the
beautiful and fitting in form and
color. The grand features and characteristics
of those displays were
settled centuries ago. They say that
Michael Angelo himself did much toward
perfecting them. On each occasion
some able artist gives the specialties
to be introduced, always in
subservience to those general principles.
This year, the plan was given
by the distinguished architect Vespiniani.
At one time, the entire face
of the hill and the scaffolding was
ablaze with lines of variegated light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
representing a vast mass of buildings
with towers and cupola, and gigantic
gateways, on which there streamed
down from above continuous beams
of still brighter and purer light. In
the distance stood the figure of an
apostle, and by him an angel with
outstretched arm; and we understood
that we were looking at the celestial
Jerusalem, revealed in vision to the
apostle in Patmos. We marked the
gates of precious stones, perfectly represented
by the various hues of fire,
and the foundation stones bearing in
letters of light the names of the apostles.
Too soon it seemed to fade
away, but only to be renewed with
change of colors. For a while we
might still study it. Again it faded,
again was renewed with still another
exquisite arrangement of colors, and
then faded away into darkness. Then
figure after figure burst out afterward,
without any delay or tedious waiting.
At one time, a gigantic volcano, amid
the booming of cannon that caused
the ground to tremble beneath the
foot, belched forth thousands of burning
rockets, which ascended in streaks
of fire and burst over head, seeming
to fill the sky with myriads and myriads
of many-colored falling stars.
At another, the whole hill-side stood
before us as a group of majestic triumphal
arches, decorated with immense
wreaths of roses, lilies, dahlias, and
bright-colored flowers. In a niche
was seen the bust of the pontiff surrounded
by a brilliant frame, and below
we read the inscription, in which
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senatus Populusque Romarins</i>, the municipal
authorities of the city, offered
to Pius IX. their homage and congratulations
on the near approach of
the twenty-fifth year of his pontificate.
All the minor devices of pyrotechnics,
of course, abounded. When, after
three quarters of an hour, the brilliant
and almost continuous display seemed
to be closed, a little fiery messenger
started from the hill-side, on an invisible
wire, to the summit of the obelisk
in the centre of the square, and lighted
a bright flame on its point. Soon
lines of flame decorated its sides.
From its base ten little messengers
started out, not very far over the
heads of the people, reaching as many
pillars around the square, and lighting
up simultaneously ten bright Bengal
lights. It was as if day had come
back to us. The lights on the pillars
changed from white to purple and red,
and other messengers, this time seemingly
still nearer the heads, rushed
madly back to the central obelisk and
clothed that too in many-colored fire.
At last, from obelisk and pillars alike
shot up rocket after rocket, bursting
loudly in the air, and for the last time
casting their bright hues of white, and
scarlet, and orange, and green, and
purple on the hill-side, the palaces
and hotels around, and on the crowd
beneath in the square. All was over,
and at an early hour the mighty mass
was slowly moving like living torrents
down the three streets leading from
the square into the city. So great
was the crowd that it was full half an
hour before the careful police would
allow the carriages, which filled the
by-streets in the neighborhood, to enter
those thoroughfares. Gorgeous
and artistic as the spectacle was, it
had not cost beyond a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the fathers were at
work again. A general congregation
was held, as usual. The last speeches
were spoken, the last explanations
were heard; the last touches were
given to the <i>schema</i>, and the last vote
was taken, and every thing was ready
to declare and promulgate the <i>schema</i>,
as a dogmatic constitution or decree
of faith, in the next public session,
which, it was announced, would be
held on Low-Sunday.</p>

<p>The <i>Girandola</i> on Monday night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
was the celebration of the municipal
authorities. On Wednesday night,
the people had theirs&mdash;a general illumination
of the city. The proper
day would have been April 12th, the
anniversary of the pope's return from
Gaeta, and also of his wondrous escape
from all injury in an accident by
the falling of a floor at St. Agnes, outside
the walls, something like the late
disastrous one in the capital at Richmond.
Though many were injured,
cardinals, priests, and laymen, none,
we believed, were killed. But the
chair in which the pontiff was seated
came down with him through the
breaking floor without even being
overturned, and he was preserved
from even the slightest shock. Since
then, he ever keeps that day religiously
sacred, and the Romans have fallen
into the custom of celebrating it by a
general illumination of the city. This
year, as the day fell in Holy-Week, the
celebration was put off until the 20th
of April, Wednesday in Easter-Week.</p>

<p>Each householder illuminated his
own building with lines of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lampioni</i>,
as they call the plates of earthenware
or metal, filled with tallow and a
lighted wick, and surrounded by a
cylindrical screen of colored paper,
through which the light shines as a
huge diamond. The wealthier ones
affected some ornamental design in a
profuser arrangement of such lights.
Some used multitudinous cups of
colored glass, holding oil, and a
lighted taper swimming in it. In
each parish, the inhabitants clubbed
together to erect one or more special
designs of superior artistic taste and
brilliancy. The city was all aglow;
nobody save the sick staid at home;
the streets were filled with streams of
people all moving in the same direction;
for some one had, with happy
thoughtfulness, got up an itinerary or
route guide through the city, and all
seemed to follow it. It took three
hours to walk through the choice
parts of the fairy scene, if you went
on foot; and more, if you took a carriage.
The lines of mellow light,
faintly shining from windows and
cornices along all the buildings, even
the poorest, in the narrowest, and
darkest, and crookedest streets of
Rome, broken occasionally by a
brighter burst from the doorway of
some shop well illuminated in the
interior; the blaze that rose from
the lights more numerous and brighter
in the squares, or shone from the
fronts of wealthier and larger houses
and palaces, from the arches of triumph,
and from the temples of
Gothic or classic style, constructed
of wood and canvas, but to which
painting and colored lights lent for
the hour a fairy beauty like that of
Aladdin's palace; every thing united
to charm, to dazzle, and to bewilder
the spectator. The pope had gone
that afternoon as usual to St. Agnes,
to be present at a Te Deum for his
escape, and returned only after night-fall.
As he reached the square of St.
Peter's, a number of rockets shot up
into the air, and burst into a thousand
stars of every hue. It was a
signal. Instantaneously the colonnades
on either side and the front of
the church were all lighted up with
Bengal fires. The columns in front
and the walls glowed in a white or
golden light; the interior recesses
were made mysterious in a rich
purple. After a few moments, the
tints were interchanged; the bright
purple light was in front, and seemed
to change the buff travertino into alabaster
and precious marbles, and the
trembling tints of white and light gold
within imparted a supernatural beauty
to the interior recesses. Change followed
change, until the pope, amid
the enthusiastic acclamations of the
vast crowd, moved on, and at last
disappeared in the rear of St. Peter's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
to reach the grand gateway of the
Vatican palace. The crowd too
passed elsewhere, to wander along
streets converted into arcades, roofed
by lines of soft and many-colored
lights; to admire the triumphal arches,
where in niches the Saviour stood
as "the way, the truth, and the life,"
attended by the Evangelists or the
Blessed Virgin Mother, to whom
David and Isaiah bore testimony;
to look on the cross of jewelled light
shining in the dark recesses of the front
of the Pantheon, or to examine and
criticise the temples of light at the
Minerva, the Santi Apostoli, or Monticilorio;
to rest themselves at times,
listening to the music of the bands,
which ever and anon they encountered;
to look with delight on the
illuminated steamers and barges on
the river, bearing (for the nonce) the
flags of every Christian nation, and to
study the play of light reflected on the
rippling surface of old Father Tiber;
to wonder at the obelisks converted
into columns of fire, or the grand stairway
of TrinitÃ  di Monte, made a
mountain of light, and a glorious grand
stairway seeming to reach the heavens,
or to watch the changing colors of Bengal
fires, illuming the statues of old
Neptune and his tritons and sea-horses,
and the wild cavernous rocks
and dashing waters of the exquisite
fountain of Trevi; or, after all, to stroll
through some square, where yellow
gravelly walks led you between beds
of green herbage, where tiny fountains
were bubbling, where trees were laden
with fruits of light, and where flowers
filled the air with sweet perfumes.
All Rome was in the streets, and in
their orderly, calm, and dignified way
enjoyed the scene hugely. Not a
loud voice or an angry word was
heard, not the slightest symptom of
intoxication was seen. Everywhere
the hum of pleasant talk of friends
and family groups arose, made sparkling
and brilliant to the ear, rather
than interrupted, by the low but
hearty and silvery laughs of men,
of women, and of delighted children.
The Romans were out, all
in their best apparel; and not they
alone, but thousands from the villages
of the campagnas and the
neighboring mountains, in their bright
colors and quaint mediÃ¦val traditional
costumes. All these were a study
to the sixty thousand visitors then
passing through the streets of Rome,
not less interesting and instructive
than the gorgeous illumination itself.
Among those sixty thousand strangers
there was but one decision&mdash;that
nowhere else in Europe could there
be an illumination so spontaneous, so
general, so perfectly artistic, so exquisitely
beautiful and grand as this was,
and nowhere else could such a vast
crowd walk these narrow streets for
hours with such perfect order, such
good humor, and such universal
courtesy.</p>

<p>There were other celebrations during
these two weeks, both ecclesiastical
and social, but it will suffice to
have spoken of the chief ones. The
repositories or sepulchres of Holy-Thursday
evening, the services of
the three hours' agony in many churches
about noon on Good-Friday, and
the sermons and way of the cross in
the ruins of the Colosseum, the scene
of so many martyrdoms, on Good-Friday
afternoon, would all deserve
special mention; but we have not
the space, and must pass on to the
third public session of the Vatican
Council.</p>

<p>This, as we have already stated, was
fixed for Sunday, April 26th&mdash;Low-Sunday.
At nine <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, the cardinals,
patriarchs, primates, archbishops, bishops,
mitred abbots, and superiors of
religious orders were in their places.
The council hall had been restored
to the original form in which we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
seen it on the day of the opening.
All the changes to fit it for the discussions
of the general congregations
were removed. The Noble Guard and
the Knights of Malta were on duty as
custodians of the assembly. Cardinal
Bilio celebrated a pontifical high-mass,
as had been done in each of the previous
sessions. At its termination, the
Gospel was enthroned on the altar.
The holy father intoned the "Veni
Creator Spiritus," and the choir and
united assembly of prelates sung the
strophes alternately to the conclusion
of that sublime hymn. The pontiff
chanted the opening prayers, and all
knelt when the litany of the saints
was intoned in the varied and well-known
antique melodies of Gregorian
chant. At the proper place, the pontiff
chanted the special supplications
for a blessing on the council, and the
chanters and the assembly, and, in
fact, thousands of the audience, joined
in the swelling responses. The effect
seemed even to surpass that which we
described in our first article, giving an
account of the opening of the council.
Other prayers followed, prescribed by
the ritual. At their conclusion, the special
work of this session commenced.</p>

<p>According to the olden time ritual
of councils, all in the hall, not belonging
strictly to the council, should at
this point be sent away, and the gates
should be closed, that in their voting
the fathers might be free from all outside
influence, and each might speak
his mind, unswayed by fear or favor.
But if, in stormier times, when clamorous
mobs might invade a council
hall, such precautions were necessary,
here, to-day, they are certainly unnecessary.
There is no need to close the
wide portals against these thousands
and tens of thousands who have gathered
to look with reverence and rapture
on this venerable assembly. Let
the doors then stand open to their widest
extent, that all may see.</p>

<p>And it was a scene worth coming,
as many had done, across oceans and
mountains to look on. The pillars
and walls of the noble hall were rich
with appropriate paintings, with mosaics,
and statuary, and marbles. At
the furthest end, on his elevated seat,
sat the venerated sovereign pontiff,
bearing on his head a precious mitre,
glittering with jewels, and wearing a
cope rich with massive golden embroidery.
On either hand sat the
venerable cardinals, arrayed in white
mitres, and wearing their richest robes
of office. In front of them sat the patriarchs,
mostly easterns, in the rich and
bright-colored robes of their respective
rites, and wearing tiaras radiant with
brilliants and jewelry. Down either
side of the hall ran the manifold lines
of primates, archbishops, bishops, and
other prelates, all in white mitres, and
in copes of red lama; all save the
oriental prelates, who wear many-colored
copes and vestments, and rich
tiaras, ever catching the eye of the
spectator as they sat scattered here
and there in that crowd, and excepting
also the heads of religious orders,
who wear each his appropriate dress
of white, or of black, or of brown, or
mingle these colors together. The
contrast and play of various colors in
all these vestments give a brilliancy
to the whole scene, much beyond
what the uniform white of the first
two sessions had yielded.</p>

<p>But what mattered the color of
their vestments, when one considered
the venerable forms of the bishops
themselves. They sat still, and almost
as motionless as so many marble
statues. Now and then some
aged prelate, with bald head and
snow-white locks, would lay aside
for a few moments the heavy mitre,
that perhaps was pressing his aged
brows too heavily. All else seemed
motionless. Their countenances, composed
and thoughtful, told how thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
they, at least, were impressed
with the importance and the solemnity
of their work.</p>

<p>In the middle stood the altar, rich
and simple, on which lay enthroned
the open book of the Gospels. Near
by stood the light and lofty pulpit of
dark wood.</p>

<p>Into this pulpit now ascended Monsignor
Valenziani, Bishop of Fabriano
and Matelica, one of the assistant
secretaries, and in a voice remarkable
for its strength and distinctness, and
not less so for its endurance, read
with most appropriate emphasis, and
with the musical intonations of a cultivated
Italian voice, the entire <cite>Dogmatic
Constitution</cite>, from the beginning
to the end. It occupied just three
quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>At the conclusion he asked, "Most
eminent and most reverend fathers,
do you approve of the canons and
decrees contained in this constitution?"</p>

<p>He descended from the pulpit, and
Monsignor Jacobini, another assistant
secretary took his place, to call for the
votes of the fathers, one by one.</p>

<p>"The Most Eminent Constantine
Cardinal Patrizi, Bishop of Porto and
Santa Rufina!"</p>

<p>The venerable cardinal arose in his
place. We heard his answer, <span class="smcap">Placet</span>;&mdash;<i>I
approve</i>. An usher standing near
him repeated, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placet</i>; a second one
on the right hand side repeated, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placet</i>;
a third on the other side repeated
aloud, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placet</i>.</p>

<p>"The Most Eminent Aloysius Cardinal
Amat, Bishop of Palestrina!"
The aged cardinal rose slowly, and
in a feeble voice replied, <span class="smcap">Placet</span>.
And from the ushers again we heard
echoing through the hall, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placet!
Placet! Placet!</i></p>

<p>Thus there could be no mistake as
to the vote, and not only the notaries
but all who wished could keep a
correct tally.</p>

<p>Cardinal after cardinal was thus
called in order and voted; then the
patriarchs, each one of whom, rising,
declared his vote, and the ushers repeated
it loudly. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placet! Placet!
Placet!</i></p>

<p>Then on through the primates, the
archbishops, and bishops, the mitred
abbots, and the heads of religious
orders, admitted to the right of suffrage.
Where a vote was given, the
three ushers invariably repeated it.
Sometimes when a name was called
the answer was given, <span class="smcap">Abest</span>&mdash;<i>he is
absent</i>. In all, six hundred and sixty-seven
votes were cast, all of them in
approval, not a single one in the
negative. Not a few of the bishops
had obtained leave to go to their dioceses
for the Holy-Week and the
Easter festivities, and had not yet
been able to return to the council.
We knew of one who, after two weeks
of hard work at home, had travelled
all Saturday night, on the train, and
had reached Rome only at nine <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>
Sunday morning. He had at once
said mass privately in the nearest convenient
chapel, and, without waiting
for even the slightest refreshment, had
hurried to St. Peter's, that he might
take his place among his brethren and
record his "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placet</i>." The whole form
of voting occupied about two hours.
It was, in truth, a solemn and most
impressive scene. There was a pause
at the end, while the notaries counted
up the votes, and declared the result.
This done, the pope spoke aloud, "<i>The
canons and decrees contained in this
constitution, having been approved by
all the fathers, without a single dissentient,
we, with the approbation of this
holy council, define them, as they have
been read, and by our apostolic authority
we confirm them</i>." It was the official
sanction sealing their force and truth.</p>

<p>The pontiff paused for a moment,
evidently struggling with the emotions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
of his heart, and then continued in an
impromptu address in Latin, which
we caught as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Most reverend brethren, you see how
good and sweet it is to walk together in
agreement in the house of the Lord. Walk
thus ever; and as our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ on this day said to his apostles,
<span class="smcap">Peace</span>, I, his unworthy vicar, say unto
you in his name, <span class="smcap">Peace</span>. Peace, as you
know, casteth but fear. Peace, as you know,
closes our ears to words of evil. May that
peace accompany you all the days of your life.
May it console you and give you strength in
death. May it be to you everlasting joy in
heaven."</p></blockquote>

<p>The bishops were moved, many of
them to tears, by the dignity and the
paternal affection with which the
simple words came from his heart.
He was himself deeply moved.</p>

<p>Other prayers were chanted. The
pontifical blessing was given, and the
pope intoned the Te Deum. The
choir, the bishops, and the thousands
of priests and laity in the church, who
had looked on this solemn act of the
church just executed, joined in with
their whole heart and soul, and swelled
the grand Ambrosian melody, making
it roll throughout the church, and
calling echoes from every chapel and
arch, from nave and transept and
dome. And with this concordant
song of gratitude to God, the third
session of the Vatican Council was
appropriately closed.</p>

<p>The pontiff departed, accompanied
by some of the cardinals, by the senator
and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">conservatori</i> of Rome, the
masters-at-arms of the council, and
the attendants of his pontifical household.
Soon the cardinals and prelates
moved slowly from the council hall
into the vast church, unrobed in a
chapel set apart for the purpose, and
wended their way homeward, and
the third public session of the council
was over.</p>

<p>We were able, in our last number,
to present to our readers the
original text, in Latin, of the constitution
promulgated in this session,
and also a correct translation of it in
English. It will be seen on examining
the subjects treated of, and by
the absolute unanimity of the votes
given, how far astray "our own correspondents"
were, both as to the
matters under discussion in the council,
and as to the divisions which
they imagined to exist among the
fathers.</p>

<p>Since Low-Sunday, the general
congregations have resumed their sittings,
and the committees on matters
of faith and on matters of discipline
have been busily engaged. Matters
from the latter committee have already
been rediscussed, and some
preliminary votes have been taken.
It is understood that ere long the
committee on matters of faith will
report back to the general congregation
another <i>schema</i> on the church,
in the course of which the question
of the infallibility of the pope, of
which so much has been written and
said, will at last come formally before
the council. Should this be the
case, we may be sure the whole subject
will be examined with the care
and research which its importance requires,
and which the dignity and
the learning of the fathers demand.
The result will be that decision to
which the Holy Spirit of truth will
guide them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rome</span>, May 8, 1870.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;We may add to this announcement
of our correspondent,
that the discussion of the <i>schema</i> on
infallibility was begun on the 10th of
May, and is expected to be finished
before the 29th of June.</p>

<h2>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>


<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">An American Political Economy;
including Strictures on the
Management of the Finances
since 1861.</span> With a chart showing
the fluctuations in the price of gold.
By Francis Bowen, Professor of
Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy,
and Civil Polity in Harvard College.
New York: Scribner &amp; Co. 1870.
16mo, pp. 495.</p>

<p>We took up this book with an old
prejudice against the author of some
thirty years standing, as well as with
an inveterate dislike to almost all works
on political economy, which it has ever
been our misfortune to read; but we
have been pleased and instructed by
it. Professor Bowen is not a philosopher;
has not, properly speaking, a
scientific mind; but he has great practical
good sense, and a wide, and we
should say a thorough, acquaintance with
the facts of his subject, and the ability to
set them forth in a clear and strong
light. He is no system-monger, is wedded
to no system of his own, and aims
to look at facts as they are. It is a
great merit of his book that it recognizes
that each country should have its
own political economy growing out of
and adapted to its peculiar wants and
circumstances. Free-trade or protection
may be for the interest of one country
and not for another, and no universal
rule as to either can be laid down.</p>

<p>The author, a follower of John Locke
in philosophy, is of course not good at
definitions, and his definition of wealth
is rather clumsy, but he contrives as
he proceeds to tell us what it is. All
wealth is the product of labor, and a
man is wealthy just in proportion to his
ability to purchase or command the labor
of others. Hence the absurdity of those
theorists who demand an equal division
of property or an equality of wealth, as
well as of the legislation that seeks to
ameliorate the condition of the poor by
making them rich, or furnishing them
with facilities for becoming rich. If all
were wealthy, all would be poor; for
then no one would sell his labor; and if
no one would sell his labor, no one could
buy labor, and then every man would be
reduced to the necessity of doing every
thing for himself. All men have equal
natural rights as men, and this is all the
equality that is practicable or desirable.</p>

<p>The reader will find the professor has
treated the question of banks with rare
lucidity, as also that of paper money, and
even money itself. But the portion of
his work that most interests us is his
strictures on the management of our
national finances since 1861, and especially
Mr. Secretary Chase's pet
scheme of national banks. According
to his showing, it would exceed
the wit of man to invent and follow
a more ruinous financial policy than
that pursued by the national administration
since the inauguration of the
late Mr. Lincoln as President. He
shows that the Northern States could
have met and actually did pay enough
during the civil war to meet all the expenses
of the war without contracting a
cent of debt, and consequently the two
or three thousand millions of dollars'
debt actually contracted was solely due
to our national financiers. There never
was any need of resorting to any thing
more than temporary national loans if the
government had had in the beginning the
wisdom or the courage, or indeed the confidence
in the people, to adopt the scale
of taxation subsequently adopted. There
never was any need of compelling the
banks to suspend specie payments, or
for it to issue legal-tender notes, but
what was created by its own blunders.
The people could have paid as they
went for the war, and been richer at
its close than at its beginning.</p>

<p>As if creating paper money for all purposes
except customs dues, demeritizing
gold and silver, depreciating the currency,
and enormously inflating the prices
of all commodities, was not enough, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
must needs create the national banks,
and make them a free gift of $300,000,000
of circulation, and that without the least
relief to the government, but to its great
embarrassment, still more inflating the
currency, and running up gold to a premium
of 285. Even since the war it
continues its blunders, and does all in
its power to increase the burdens of the
people. It seems from the first to have
proceeded on the principle of securing
the support of the people by enabling
individuals to amass huge fortunes at
the public expense. Why, if it must
have national banks, need it make them
banks of circulation? Why not compel
them to bank on its own legal tenders
instead of their own notes, and thus
save to itself the profits on $300,000,000
of circulation? It would have run no
risk it does not now run; for the treasury
is responsible for the redemption
of the notes of the national banks, and
the security it holds from them would
be perfectly illusory in any monetary
crisis. But we have no room to proceed.
We, however, recommend this
part of the work to the serious consideration
of our national financiers.
There are in political economy deeper
problems than Professor Bowen has
grasped; but upon the whole, he has
given us the most sensible work on
the subject that we are acquainted

<p>This volume consists of a series of

not, however, a book containing meditations
for the entire year, as one would
be led to imagine from its title. The
number of meditations is only ninety.
So it is supposed&mdash;and the plan is a

selected according to each one's devotion.
A word may very fitly be said in
praise of the composition of these spiritual
readings. They appear to be
really addressed to the reader. Moreover,
they contain no foolish exaggerations.
These two merits are not unfrequently
wanting in books of meditations.
The present volume relates to the duties

suitable meditations for the ecclesiastical

to his opinion, it comes to us

methods of learning to love Jesus in his
sacrament of love. Yet the meditations
are not merely beautiful, they are also
very practical. In our reading, we have
never met so touching and so useful a

"The Hem of our Lord's Garment." If

of Marriage.</span> By Hugh
Davey Evans, LL.D. With a Biographical
Sketch of the Author, etc.
New York: Hurd &amp; Houghton. 1870.</p>

<p>Dr. Evans was a friend of ours in
days long gone by, and we used frequently
to contribute articles to the magazine
which he edited, one of which,
entitled "Dissent and Semi-Dissent,"
has been incorrectly attributed to him
by his biographer. We have always
cherished a sentiment of respect for the
quaint and learned old gentleman, whose
portrait has been drawn in the brief biographical
sketch prefixed to this volume
with singular fidelity and accuracy. Dr.
Evans was a regular old-fashioned High-Churchman,
after the model of Hooker
and Wilson, and consequently imbued
with many soundly Catholic principles
and sentiments, mixed up with many
other incongruous English and Protestant
prejudices. In the work before us,
he has with masterly learning and ability
defended the Christian doctrine of
marriage in a manner which is in the
greater number of essential respects
sound and satisfactory. Unfortunately,
having only his own individual judgment
as his tribunal of last resort in defining
Catholic doctrine, instead of councils
and popes, he has sanctioned one most
fatal error, the lawfulness of divorces <i>a
vinculo</i>, and subsequent remarriage, in
the case of adultery on the part of the
wife. We are glad to see that his editor
dissents from him in this respect, and
has republished the admirable little
treatise of Bishop Andrews sustaining
the opposite side of the question. It is
a wonder that any person can fail to see
how utterly worthless is any pretended
church authority which leaves such an
essential matter as this open to dispute.
We are glad to see works circulated
among Protestants which advocate any
sound principles on this subject, even
though they are incomplete. They have
much more influence than the works of
Catholic authors; they form a "serviceable
breakwater" to the inflowing tide of
corruption, and prepare the way for
the eventual triumph of the Catholic
doctrine and law, which alone can save
society from dissolution. The <cite>Atlantic
Monthly</cite>, which is the favorite magazine
of a very large class of the most highly
cultivated minds in New England and
in other portions of the United States,
has descended to the lowest level of the
free-love doctrine, and thus fixed on itself
the seal of that condemnation which
it has been earning for a long time
past, as the most dangerous and corrupting
of all our literary periodicals.
We hope that it will be banished hereafter
from every Catholic family, and
receive no more commendatory notices
from the Catholic press. We are glad
to see the strong and manly refutation
of its immoral nonsense given by <cite>The
Nation</cite>, although its argument fails of
the sanction which is alone sufficient
to compel assent, and efficiently control
legislation and public opinion in
a matter where so severe a curb is
placed on passion and liberty to follow
the individual will. We are happy to
welcome such sensible and valuable aid
to the cause of social morality as that
given by <cite>The Nation</cite>, but we must disown
entirely another champion of monogamy,
to wit, the Methodist preacher,
Dr. Newman, as more dangerous than
an open antagonist. We see that this
conspicuous declaimer intends to maintain
in a public discussion, to be held in
the Mormon temple, the irreligious and
scandalous thesis that the holy patriarchs
of the old law who practised polygamy
were adulterers and sinners against
the divine law. This is quite consistent
with Luther's immoral doctrine that men
totally depraved and steeped in deadly
sin can be friends of God through a
legal fiction of imputed righteousness;
but it is equally shocking to piety and
common sense, and as completely subversive
of Christianity as the superstitious
imposture of Joe Smith. We
predict an easy victory of Brigham
Young over Dr. Newman. Dr. Evans,
as corrected by his editor and Bishop
Andrews, advocates the sound Christian
doctrine of marriage, and the circulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
of his work must therefore have a most
beneficial influence.</p>

<p>This exhaustive essay, read before the

we trust, have a great influence toward
remedying the present loose domestic

nostrums which are now exposed for

effrontery.</p>

<p>Recent statistics, published by Dr.
Storer and others, prove the fearful prevalence
of the crime of f&oelig;ticide among
the native population; and the next
census will no doubt show an absolute
decrease of that class in the New England
States. We hope when thus placed
officially before the eyes of the Protestant
clergy, they will awaken to the
necessity of at least informing their congregations
of the enormity of this sin;
so that the plea of ignorance, now urged
to extenuate their guilt, can no longer
be used.</p>

<p>Physiology has definitely settled that
vitality begins from the moment of conception.
Theology pronounces the
destruction of human life to be murder,
and consequently the Catholic Church
impresses in every possible way upon

will be visited upon those who in any
way tamper with the helpless unborn.
We commend the paper to the careful

For sale by the Catholic Publication
Society, 9 Warren Street, New York.</p>

<p>Both the author and translator of this
volume are favorably known to our readers.
Their reputation will be much increased
by this pleasing biography. Our
"Noble Lady" is Adelaide Capece Minutolo,
an Italian of rank. Accomplished,
refined, and devout, she is a perfect
picture of the Christian lady. Her life
presents nothing extraordinary. She
did not become a nun. She never married.
Yet she was very beautiful, and
could have married suitably to her station.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
She preferred the love and companionship
of a younger sister to the
uncertainty of marriage and the keener
joys and splendors of the world. Early
in life these sisters mutually resolved
to seek nothing further than to live together;
nor did either ever feel a regret,
or doubt the wisdom of their choice, till,
at the end of eight and twenty years,
death dissolved their union. It is only
in Italy that religion, art, and literary
pursuits have met together, inspired, as
it were, by the most glorious scenery,
and where man's soul and heart, the understanding
and the eye, are completely
satisfied. Perhaps it is only the daughters
of Italy who unite great simplicity,
wonderful sweetness, and charming tenderness
to heroic courage and capacity
for such studies as usually are
interesting only to men. Such was
the character of the Noble Lady. No
person of refinement can read this
book, without repeating the touching
exclamation of a poor Neapolitan woman,
who, while she was praying by
her coffin, was heard to exclaim, "<i>Go,
then, go to thy home, thou beautiful bit
of Paradise!</i>"</p>

<p>It is indeed seldom than one will meet
with a more charming and interesting
book than this. It contains accounts
of visits made by the author to various sanctuaries
of the Blessed Virgin in that
favored region in the south of France
which she seems to love so much; the
most recent proof of this being her apparition
at the Grotto of Lourdes, to the
description of which a considerable part
of the work is devoted. The account is
hardly if at all inferior, except in its necessary
brevity, to that of M. Henri Lasserre
on the same subject, and contains
some additional events which have recently
occurred, such as the cure of the
celebrated Father Hermann. Besides the
description and history of the sanctuaries,
the lives of several of the saints
which this region has produced are
given, and an account of their shrines;
among these is one of St. Vincent of
Paul. The book would be well worth
reading for the pictures which are given
of the magnificent scenery of the Pyrenean
valleys; and its appearance and
type are so beautiful that they would
make even indifferent matter attractive.</p>

Primary Arithmetic; Intellectual

Arithmetic.</span> By S. A.
Felter, A.M. New York: Charles
Scribner &amp; Co.</p>

<p>A sketch of the science of numbers
through its various progressive stages
to its present almost perfect development
would be of much interest, but our
limited space forbids us entering upon
it. Of the many series now before the
public, much can be said by way of
commendation; we think, however, that
Felter's, while in nowise inferior to the
best, has some peculiar features which
give it a decided superiority. Of these
may be mentioned the very large number
of examples given under each rule, and
the test questions for examination which
are found at the close of each section.
These cannot fail to secure to the pupil
a thorough understanding of his subject
before he leaves it. We also note with
pleasure the <em>entire</em> absence of answers
from the text-books intended for use by
the pupils. A high-school arithmetic
now in course of preparation will soon
be added to the series, and will then
form a curriculum of arithmetical instruction
at once gradually progressive,
and hence simple, thoroughly practical,
and complete. The author has evidently
a full knowledge of the needs of both
pupil and teacher, and has admirably
succeeded in supplying their respective
deficiencies.</p>

Is it necessary to inform any Catholic

presents a life-like portrait of it, which
must rekindle the devotion already so
widely-spread and fervent toward one
who seems like a reproduction of the
type of youthful sanctity which would
have been seen in the sons of Adam, if
their father had never sinned. Every
father and mother ought to make it a
point to have this book read by their
children, that they may fall in love with
virtue and piety, embodied in the winning,

Formby. Londini: Burns, Oates,
Socii BibliopolÃ¦.</p>

<p>This is an ably-written pamphlet, containing
what appears to us a singularly
happy and valuable suggestion. The
author's intention is concisely expressed
on his title-page, namely, that "the
best arts of our modern civilization" be
called into the service of God for once,
(as they are daily done into that of Satan,)
to furnish a "life of our Lord Jesus
Christ" for all the nations of Christendom,
a work which shall be for three
chief ends: "first, as a symbol of the
true unity of all peoples in the church;
secondly, as a beautiful memorial of the
&OElig;cumenical Council of the Vatican; and
thirdly, as a very sweet solace and ornament
for the daily life of all Christians."</p>

<p>The arts in question are typography,
engraving, and photography; the last to
be used for furnishing views of the various
spots and regions throughout Palestine
hallowed by the steps of Jesus
Christ; and this would necessitate a
committee of competent men being sent
to explore the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The expense of the entire undertaking
is to be defrayed by public subscription
and the patronage of the rich, and,
of course, it is for the holy father to
inaugurate and supervise the matter.
Wherefore the author humbly submits
his pamphlet to the consideration of the
holy see and the council.</p>

<p>For ourselves, we repeat our belief
that such a work as this projected life
of Christ would indeed be an inestimable
boon to Christendom. Father
Formby's hopes appear to us not at all
too sanguine; and he has our cordial

<h2>MR. FROUDE'S HISTORY OF ENGLAND.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a><br />

<small>SECOND ARTICLE.</small></h2>


<p>In our first article<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> we referred in
general terms to the fact that Mr.
Froude had plunged into a great historical
subject without the requisite
knowledge or the necessary preparation.
This judgment was presumed
to be so well established by the concurrent
testimony of the most opposite
schools of criticism, both English
and French, that it was not thought
necessary to cite examples from his
pages. In that notice we merely undertook
to state the general results
of criticism as to Mr. Froude's first
six volumes, reserving particular examination
for the latter half of the
work, with special reference to his
treatment of Mary Stuart.</p>

<p>Since, however, it has been said
that we charge the historian with
shortcomings, and give no instances
in support, we will, before proceeding
further, satisfy this objection. This
could be most easily and profusely
done by going into his treatment of
questions of the contemporary history
of foreign countries, or of general
history preceding the sixteenth
century, in both of which Mr. Froude
is deplorably weak. But we prefer a
more decisive test, one that leaves
the historian without excuse, and
will, therefore, not only confine it to
English history, but to English history
of the period of Elizabeth, with
which, according to his late plaintive
appeal to the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, Mr.
Froude has labored so diligently and
is so entirely familiar.</p>

<p>And the test proposed illustrates
not only his imperfect mastery of
his own selected period of English
history, but his total unconsciousness
of the existence of one of the most
peculiar laws of England in force for
centuries before and after that period.
A clever British reviewer, in expressing
his surprise at our historian's multifarious
ignorance concerning the
civil and criminal jurisprudence of
his country, says that it is difficult to
believe that Mr. Froude has ever
seen the face of an English justice;
and the reproach is well merited.
Nevertheless we do not look for the
accuracy of a Lingard or a Macaulay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
an imaginative writer like Mr. Froude,
and might excuse numerous slips and
blunders as to law pleadings and the
forms of criminal trials&mdash;nay, even as
to musty old statutes and conflicting
legislative enactments, (as, for instance,
when he puts on an air of
critical severity (vol. ix. p. 38) as to
the allowance of a delay of fifteen
days in Bothwell's trial, claiming, in
his defective knowledge of the Scotch
law, that it should have been forty
days;) but when we find his mind a
total blank as to the very existence
of one of the most peculiar and salient
features of English law, we must
insist that such ignorance in one who
sets up for an English historian is far
from creditable.</p>

<p>Here is the case. During the reign
of Elizabeth, one Thomas Cobham,
like unto many other good English
Protestants, was "roving the seas,
half-pirate, half knight-errant of the
Reformation, doing battle on his own
account with the enemies of the
truth, wherever the service of God
was likely to be repaid with plunder."
(Froude, vol. viii. p. 459.) He
took a Spanish vessel, (England and
Spain being at peace,) with a cargo
valued at eighty thousand ducats,
killing many on board. After all
resistance had ceased, he "sewed up
the captain and the survivors of the
crew in their own sails, and flung
them overboard." Even in England
this performance of Cobham was
looked upon as somewhat irregular,
and at the indignant requisition of
Spain, he was tried in London for
piracy. De Silva, the Spanish ambassador
at the court of Elizabeth, wrote
home an account of the trial. We
now quote Mr. Froude, who being&mdash;as
a learned English historian should
be&mdash;perfectly familiar with the legal
institutions of his country, and knowing
full well that the punishment described
by De Silva was never inflicted
in England, is naturally shocked
at the ignorance of this foreigner,
and thus presents and comments upon
his letter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thomas Cobham," wrote De Silva,
"being asked at the trial, according to the
usual form in England, if he had any thing
to say in arrest of judgment, and answering
nothing, was condemned to be taken to
the Tower, to be stripped naked to the skin,
and then to be placed with his shoulders
resting on a sharp stone, his legs and arms
extended and on his stomach a gun, too
heavy for him to bear, yet not large enough
immediately to crush him. There he is to
be left till he die. They will give him a
few grains of corn to eat, and for drink the
foulest water in the Tower." (Froude, vol.
viii. p. 449, London ed. of 1863.)</p></blockquote>

<p>It would not be easy to state the
case in fewer words and more accurately
than De Silva here puts it.
Cobham was called upon to answer
in the usual form, and "answering
nothing" or "standing mute," "was
condemned," etc. A definition of
the offence and a description of its
punishment by the well-known <i>peine
forte et dure</i> were thus clearly presented;
but even then Mr. Froude fails
to recognize an offence and its penalty,
perfectly familiar to any student
who has ever read Blackstone or
Bailey's Law Dictionary, and makes
this astounding comment on De Silva's
letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Had any such sentence been pronounced,
it would not have been left to be discovered in
the letter of a stranger</i>; the ambassador
may perhaps, in this instance, have been
purposely deceived, and his demand for
justice satisfied by a fiction of imaginary
horror." (Froude, vol. viii. p. 449, London
ed. 1863.)</p></blockquote>

<p>This unfortunate performance of
Mr. Froude was received by critics
with mirthful surprise, and, as a consequence,
although the passages we
have cited may be found, as we have
indicated, in the London edition of
1863, they need not be looked for
in later editions. On the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
we now learn from Mr. Froude
(Scribner edition of 1870, vol viii. p.
461) that "Cobham refused to plead
to his indictment, and the dreadful
sentence was passed upon him of the
<i>peine forte et dure</i>;" and thereto is
appended an erudite note for the instruction
of persons supposed to be
unacquainted with English law, explaining
the matter, and citing Blackstone,
"book iv. chap. 25."</p>

<p>Ah! learning is a beautiful thing!</p>

<p>But, possibly it may be suggested,
this dreadful punishment was rarely
inflicted, and that fact may serve to
excuse Mr. Froude? Not at all.
Other instances of the <i>peine forte et
dure</i> occurred in this very reign of
Elizabeth, with whose history Mr.
Froude is so very familiar. Here is
one which inspires us with a feeling
of compassion for the much-abused
Spanish Inquisition, and proportionately
increases our admiration of the
"glorious Reformation."</p>

<p>Margaret Middleton, the wife of
one Clitheroe, a rich citizen of York,
was prosecuted for having harbored
a priest in quality of a schoolmaster.
At the bar (March 25th, 1586) she
refused to plead guilty, because she
knew that no sufficient proof could
be brought against her; and she
would not plead "not guilty," because
she considered such a plea
equivalent to a falsehood. The <i>peine
forte et dure</i> was immediately ordered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After she had prayed, Fawcet, the sheriff,
commanded them to put off her apparel;
when she, with the four women,
requested him on their knees, that, for the
honor of womanhood, this might be dispensed
with. But they would not grant it.
Then she requested them that the women
might unapparel her, and that they would
turn their faces from her during that time.</p>

<p>"The women took off her clothes, and
put upon her the long linen habit. Then
very quickly she laid her down upon the
ground, her face covered with a handkerchief,
and most part of her body with the
habit. The <i>dure</i> (door) was laid upon her;
her hands she joined toward her face. Then
the sheriff said, 'Naie, ye must have your
hands bound.' Then two sergeants parted
her hands, and bound them to two posts.
After this they laid weight upon her,
which, when she first felt she said, 'Jesu,
Jesu, Jesu, have mercye upon mee,' which
were the last words she was heard to speake.
She was in dying about one quarter of an
hour. A sharp stone, as much as a man's
fist had been put under her back; upon her
was laied to the quantitie of seven or eight
hundred weight, which, breaking her ribbs,
caused them to burst forth of the skinne."</p></blockquote>

<p>This question of the <i>peine forte et
dure</i> naturally brings us to the consideration
of a kindred subject most singularly
treated in Mr. Froude's pages.
If the constant use of</p>


<h3>TORTURE AND THE RACK</h3>

<p>had been a feature of Mary Stuart's
reign, and not, as it was, the daily
expedient of Elizabeth and Cecil, what
bursts of indignant eloquence should
we not have been favored with by
our historian, and what admirable illustrations
would it not have furnished
him as to the brutalizing tendencies
of Catholicity and the superior
humanity and enlightenment of Protestantism?
Nothing so clearly shows
the government of Elizabeth to have
been a despotism as her constant employment
of torture. Every time she
or Cecil sent a prisoner to the rack&mdash;and
they sent hundreds&mdash;they trampled
the laws of England under foot.
These laws, it is true, sometimes authorized
painful ordeals and severe
punishments, but the rack never. Torture
was never legally authorized in
England. But the trickling blood,
the agonized cries, the crackling bones,
the "strained limbs and quivering
muscles" (Froude vol. vi. p. 294) of
martyred Catholics make these Tudor
practices lovely in Mr. Froude's eyes,
and he philosophically remarks, "The
method of inquiry, however inconsonant
with modern conceptions of justice,
was adapted excellently for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
outrooting of the truth." (Vol. vii. p.
293)</p>

<p>We can hardly believe that any
other man of modern enlightenment
could possibly entertain such opinions.
They are simply amazing in their cold-blooded
and crude ignorance. Torture
is not only "inconsonant" with
modern conceptions of justice, but
also with ancient; for it is condemned
even by the sages of the law which
authorized it. If Mr. Froude had any
knowledge of the civil law, he might
have learned something of this matter
from the Digests, (<cite>Liber</cite> xviii. tit. 18.)
The passage is too long to cite, but
one sentence alone tells us in a few
words of the fallacy, danger, and decaption
of the use of torture: "Etenim
res est fragilis et periculosa, et quÃ¦
veritatem fallat."</p>

<p>So much for ancient opinion. And
modern justice has rejected the horrible
thing, not only on the ground of
morality, but because it has been demonstrated
to be a promoter of perjury
and the worst possible means of
"outrooting" the truth.</p>

<p>To return: the case of Cobham is
not the only one in which Mr. Froude
has prudently profited by criticism, and
hastened, in a new edition of his work,
to repair his blunder. Even a slight
comparison of his first with his last
edition will show him to be under
deep obligations to his critics, and it
would be wise in him to seek to increase
his debt of gratitude by fresh
corrections.</p>


<h3>THE CHATELAR STORY</h3>

<p>is told by Mr. Froude in his characteristic
way, and, while acquitting Mary
Stuart of blame, "she had probably
nothing worse to accuse herself of than
thoughtlessness," (vol. vii. p. 506,) manages
to leave a stain upon her character.
He prefaces the story with
the statement that "she was selfish in
her politics and sensual in her passions."
Serious historians generally
use language with some reference to
its value; but one epithet costs Mr.
Froude no more effort than another,
although there is not a shadow of pretext
thus far in his own version of
Mary's history to justify so foul an
outrage as the use here of this word
"sensual." We pass on. Chatelar
was a young Huguenot gentleman, a
nephew of the noble Bayard, gifted
and highly accomplished. He had
accompanied his patron D'Amville to
Scotland, and returned with him to
France. D'Amville was a suitor for
Mary's hand, and, after some time,
dispatched Chatelar to Scotland with
missives for the queen. Randolph
was present when Chatelar arrived,
and describes D'Amville's letter as of
"three whole sheets of paper." Yet
Mr. Froude, perfectly aware of all this,
writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He went back to France, but he could
not remain there. The moth was <i>recalled</i> to
the flame whose warmth was life and death
to it."</p></blockquote>

<p>The remainder is of a piece with
this. Supernaturally penetrating in
reading Mary Stuart's most hidden
thoughts, Mr. Froude is blind to the
vulgar envy of the parvenu Randolph,
who, writing to Cecil, (Froude, vol. vii.
p. 505, note,) has the mendacious impudence
to speak of Chatelar as "so
unworthy a creature and abject a varlet."</p>

<p>Of the rules that govern the admission
of evidence in ordinary courts of
law, Mr. Froude does not appear to
have any knowledge, and at every
page he manifests a total unconsciousness
of the most rudimentary test to
be applied to the testimony of a witness
in or out of court. It is to see
whether the witness has not some powerful
motive to praise or to blame.
Thus, when he desires to establish a
high character for "the stainless Murray,"
he gives us the testimony of&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
employers Elizabeth and Cecil!
In telling us what Mary Stuart was,
he most freely uses the hired pamphleteer
Buchanan, although ashamed&mdash;as
well he may be&mdash;to name his
authority.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> So also in the case before
us, although the mean envy excited
in Randolph by the accomplished and
nobly-born young Frenchman is perfectly
clear, Mr. Froude gives us the
English envoy's dispatches as testimony
not to be questioned.</p>


<h3>MARY STUART AND JOHN KNOX.</h3>

<p>An interview between the queen
and Knox in December, 1562, in
which Mr. Froude describes Knox's
rudeness as "sound northern courtesy,"
(vol. vii. p. 543,) is passed over by
him with commendable rapidity. And
of yet another interview he says not a
word.</p>

<p>Under the statute of 1560 proceedings
were taken in 1563 against Mary
in the west of Scotland for celebrating
mass.</p>

<p>The wilds of Ayrshire, in later years
the resort of persecuted Presbyterians,
were the resort of persecuted Catholics.
"On the bleak moorlands or
beneath the shelter of some friendly
roof," says Mr. Hosack,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> "they worshipped
in secret according to the
faith of their fathers." Zealous reformers
waited not for form of law to attack
and disperse the "idolaters,"
when they found them thus engaged.
Mary remonstrated with Knox against
these lawless proceedings, and argued
for freedom of worship, or, as Knox
himself states it, "no to pitt haunds
to punish ony man for using himsel
in his religion as he pleases." But
the Scotch reformer applauded the
outrage, and even asserted that private
individuals might even "slay with
their own hands idolaters and enemies
of the true religion," quoting Scripture
to prove his assertions.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Shortly
afterward forty-eight Catholics were
arraigned before the high court of justiciary
for celebrating mass, and punished
by imprisonment.</p>

<p>At page 384 (vol. vii.) we are told
by Mr. Froude that the Protestant
mob drove the priest from the altar,
(royal chapel,) "with broken head
and bloody ears," and at page 418
that "the measure of virtue in the
Scotch ministers was the audacity
with which they would reproach the
queen." "Maitland protested that
theirs was not language for subjects
to use to their sovereign," and there
really appears to be something in the
suggestion; but Mr. Froude is of the
opinion that "essentially, after all,
Knox was right," clinching it, with&mdash;"He
suspected that Mary Stuart
meant mischief to the reformation,
and she did mean mischief." And
this is the key to Mr. Froude's main
argument throughout this history.
Whoever and whatever favors the reformation
is essentially good, whoever
and whatever opposes it is essentially
vile. And the end, (the reformation)
justifies the means.</p>

<p>Far be it from us to gainsay the
perfect propriety of an occasional
supply of sacerdotal broken heads and
bloody ears, if a Protestant mob sees
fit to fancy such an amusement; or
to question the measure of virtue in
the Scotch ministers; or to approve
of the absurd protest of Maitland;
or, least of all, not swiftly to recognize
that "essentially" Knox was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>right. Not we indeed! But then
we really must be excused for venturing
to suggest&mdash;merely to suggest,
that, in the first place, if we assume
such a line of argument, we deprive
ourselves of weapons wherewith to
assail the cruelties of such men as
Alva and Philip of Spain. Surely,
the right does not essentially go with
the power to persecute! And in the
second place&mdash;that this was rather
rough treatment for a young and inexperienced
girl, against whom thus
far nothing has been shown. But here
Mr. Froude meets us with "Harlot
of Babylon," and we are again silenced.</p>

<p>Maitland absurdly hinted to Knox
that if he had a grievance he should
complain of it modestly, and was very
properly hooted at by Knox in reply.
And thereupon comes a fine passage
from Mr. Froude, admirably exemplifying
his psychological treatment of
history. (Vol. vii. p. 419.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Could she but secure first the object
on which her heart was fixed, she could indemnify
herself afterward at her leisure.
The preachers might rail, the fierce lords
might conspire; a little danger gave piquancy
to life, and the air-drawn crowns which
floated before her imagination would pay
for it all."</p></blockquote>

<p>We do not know how this may
affect other people, but "air-drawn
crowns" did the business for us, and
we proceed to make it the text for
<span class="smcap">A LESSON IN HISTORICAL WRITING</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude may or may not have
transferred the contempt and hatred of
France of the sixteenth century, which
throughout his book he loses no opportunity
of manifesting, to France of
the nineteenth century; but we venture
to suggest to him that he may
find in France models and principles
of historical treatment which he might
study with signal profit. Specially
would we commend to his lection
and serious perpension the following
pithy passage from the very latest
published volume of French history.
We refer to Lanfrey's <cite>Histoire de Napoleon
I</cite>. The author describes the
meeting of Napoleon and Alexander
at Tilsit, and, referring to the absurd
attempt made by some writers to
explain the motives which actuated
the French and Russian emperors at
their private interview on the Niemen,
makes this sensible reflection:</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est toujours dangereux et souvent
puÃ©ril de vouloir interprÃ©ter les
sentiments secrets des personnages
historiques.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> (Lanfrey, vol. iv. p. 403.
Paris, 1870.) Mr. Froude's attention
to this teaching would rapidly suppress
"air-drawn crowns" and such
like stage properties, so freely used by
him for dramatic effect.</p>


<h3>SOME OMISSIONS.</h3>

<p>Mr. Froude appears to have no
knowledge of the important proceedings
at Mary's first Parliament, May,
1563, when the corpse of the late
Earl of Huntly, kept for the purpose
since the previous October, was
brought in for attainder. Forfeiture
was declared mainly for Murray's benefit,
and at the same time the forfeitures
of the Earl of Sutherland (the
evidence against him being forgeries)
and eleven barons of the house of
Gordon were passed. In vain the
Countesses of Huntly and Sutherland
endeavored to petition the queen;
they were, by Murray's intervention,
denied access to her. Nor does our
historian appear to have heard of the
circumstances attending Murray's surreptitious
procuring of the queen's
signature to the death-warrant of
young Huntly. It is a most interesting
episode, but we have not room
for it. Some three weeks later, we
find a curious letter of Randolph to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>Cecil, which need not be sought for
in Froude. It is important as showing
the peculiar esteem in which Murray
was held at the court of &mdash;&mdash;
Elizabeth. A packet addressed to
Queen Mary had been stopped and
opened by the English officials at
Newcastle. Mary, not recognizing
her position as the vassal of Elizabeth,
complained of it to Randolph.
Whereupon Randolph writes to Cecil,
(June, 1563,) advising, "If any
suspected letters be taken, not to
open them, but to send them to my
Lord of Moray, of whose services
the Queen of England is <i>sure</i>." And
good reason there was to be <i>sure</i>;
for all the world, except Mr. Froude,
knows that the "stainless," from first
to last, was the bribed and pensioned
agent of Elizabeth.</p>


<h3>KNOX AND THE COUNCIL.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Queen of Scots," says Mr. Froude,
"had quarrelled again with Knox, whom
she attempted to provide with lodgings in
the castle; the lords had interfered, and anger
and disappointment had made her ill."
(Vol. vii. p. 549.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Here again Mary seems to fall
away from the high standard of "consummate
actress;" but, on the other
hand, Mr. Froude is fully up to his
own standard of consummate historian;
for the passage is clever, even
for him. Here is what it all means:
Cranston and Armstrong, two members
of Knox's congregation who
were afterward among the murderers
of Riccio, had been arrested and
thrown into prison for raising a riot
in the chapel royal at Holyrood,
to prevent service there. And why
should they not? A Catholic queen
had no rights which her Protestant
subjects were bound to respect. Knox
thereupon sent a circular throughout
Scotland convening his brethren to
meet in Edinburgh on a certain day&mdash;in
other words, to excite tumult and
inaugurate civil war. Let Randolph,
Mr. Froude's favorite authority, tell
the rest.</p>

<p>Randolph to Cecil, Dec. 21, 1563:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The lords had assembled to take order
with John Knox and his faction, who intended,
by a mutinous assembly made by
his letter before, to have rescued two of their
brethren from course of law for using an
outrage," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Murray and Maitland sent for Knox
and remonstrated with him. But
Knox showed no respect for either of
them. Nothing came of the interview,
and they had him summoned
before the queen and her privy council.
Seriously ill as she was, she attended.
Now compare these facts
with Mr. Froude's statement above,
(vol. vii. p. 549,) and see if it is possible
to crowd into three lines more misrepresentation
and malevolence. Note
<i>quarrelled</i>. Mary knew nothing of
the affair until after the action of the
lords and the attempt of Murray and
Maitland to persuade Knox. Mr.
Froude says Mary attempted to imprison
him, and the lords interfered.
"Anger and disappointment made her
ill." Now, this Knox affair occurred
while Randolph was waiting to have
audience of Mary, but was delayed
on account of her illness. To return
to the council. Knox's seditious letter
was produced. He boldly avowed
it, and significantly observed, referring
to certain reported practices
of Murray and Maitland, that "no
forgeries had been interpolated in the
spaces he had left blank." A week
after this event, Randolph describes
Mary as still sick, although compelled
to confer with her council.</p>


<h3>MARY'S MARRIAGE.</h3>

<p>All this time Mary has been waiting
Elizabeth's good pleasure as to whom
she shall marry. Elizabeth finally
decided to bestow upon her Scottish
sister her own lover Leicester, who
"was, perhaps, the most worthless of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
her subjects; but in the loving eyes of
his mistress he was the knight <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans peur
et sans reproche</i>; and she took a melancholy
pride in offering her sister
her choicest jewel." (Vol. viii. p. 74.)
But Mr. Froude spoils the "melancholy
pride" at the next page by telling
us that Elizabeth "was so capable
of falsehood that her own expressions
would have been an insufficient
guarantee for her sincerity."</p>

<p>Murray's opposition to Mary's marriage
with Darnley was bitter. His
ascendency in her councils had culminated
in his proposition to have
himself legitimated, and that the
queen should lease the crown to him
and Argyll. Mary's marriage to any
one would end all such hopes, and
Darnley, moreover, was personally
obnoxious to Murray because he had
been heard to say, looking at a map
of Scotland, that Murray had "too
much for a subject." Elizabeth's instructions
precisely tallied with Murray's
inclinations and interest. He
withdrew from court, and would not
attend the convention at Perth.</p>


<h3>PLOT TO IMPRISON MARY.</h3>

<p>And now comes the plot of Murray
and his friends to seize Darnley
and his father, (Lennox,) deliver them
to Elizabeth's agents or slay them if
they made resistance, and imprison
the queen at Lochleven. In a note
at page 178, vol. viii., Mr. Froude,
with a sweet and touching melancholy,
says, "A sad and singular horoscope
had already been cast for Darnley."
The magician of this horoscope
was Randolph, who fears that "Darnley
can have no long life amongst
this people." Certainly not, if Mr.
Randolph understands himself; for
his letters of that period are full of the
details of a plot to stir up an insurrection
in Scotland, place Murray at the
head of it, kill Darnley and his father,
and imprison the queen at Lochleven.
Elizabeth sent Murray Â£7000 for the
nerve of the insurrection, and her letters
to Bedford instructing him to furnish
Murray with money and soldiers
are in existence. The programme
was at last carried out eighteen months
later, when Darnley was killed and
Mary a prisoner.</p>

<p>On the 30th of June, 1565, at ten
in the morning, the queen, with a
small retinue, was to ride from Perth
to Callendar house, to be present at
the baptism of a child of her friends
Lord and Lady Livingstone. Murray's
party were to take her prisoner
at this time. The Earls of Rothes
and Argyll, and the Duke of Chatelherault
were to be stationed at three
different points on her route with an
overpowering force. Murray was to
wait at Lochleven, which he had just
provisioned and provided with artillery.
As usual, he managed to have
the overt act done by others.</p>

<p>All these arrangements were made
in concert with Randolph and Cecil,
and were so apparently perfect that
success was considered certain. So
sure was Cecil of it that an entry in his
private diary of July 7th, runs, "that
there was a rumor that the Scottish
Queen should have been taken."</p>

<p>During the night of the 29th, a warning
was conveyed to Mary of the plot.
Instead of waiting until ten, the hour
fixed for her departure, she was in the
saddle at five in the morning, and safe
at Callendar by eleven. It is very singular,
but Mr. Froude seems never to
have heard of this exciting ride, while
the "stainless" Murray was keeping
bootless watch and ward at Lochleven.
We regret it exceedingly, if
for no other reason than the loss of
an animated picture in Mr. Froude's
best style, running somewhat thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Bright shone the sun. The queen, with
incredible animosity, was mounted on a swift
courser galloping by the side of young
Darnley, and then away&mdash;away&mdash;past the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
Parenwell, past Lochleven, through Kinross,
past Castle Campbell, across the north
Ferry and over the Firth, fast as their horses
could speed; seven in all&mdash;Mary, her three
ladies, Darnley, Lennox, Atholl, and Ruthven.
In five hours the hospitable gates of
Livingstone had closed behind them, and
Mary Stuart was safe." (See vol. viii. p.
270.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Of this plot of Murray, here is the
clever record made by Mr. Froude:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A hint was given him that Darnley and
Riccio had formed a plan to kill him. He
withdrew to his mother's castle at Lochleven,
and published the occasion of his disobedience.
Mary Stuart replied with a counter-charge
that the Earl of Murray had proposed
to take her prisoner and carry Darnley
off to England." (Vol. viii. p. 180.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon this, Mr. Froude's cool comment
is, "Both stories were probably
true"! Yes, with the difference that
the proof against Murray was overwhelming;
for Mr. Froude admits that
"Murray's offer to Randolph was
sufficient evidence against himself,"
whereas there was none against Darnley.
At page 182, Mr. Froude makes
Mary "return from Perth to Edinburgh."
This renders it quite clear
that he has never heard of her hurried
ride to Callendar.</p>


<h3>QUESTION OF TOLERATION.</h3>

<p>Randolph strangely finds fault with
Mary for her toleration in religious
matters. "Her will to continue papistry,
and <i>her desire to have all men
live as they list</i>, so offendeth the godly
men's consciences, that it is continually
feared that these matters will
break out to some great mischief."
And lo! the mischief did break out.
The Assembly of the Kirk presented,
under the singular garb of a "supplication,"
a remonstrance to the queen,
in which they declared that "the practice
of idolatry" could not be tolerated
in the sovereign any more than
in the subject, and that the "papistical
and blasphemous mass" should
be wholly abolished. To whom the
queen:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Where it was desired that the mass
should be suppressed and abolished, as well
in her majesty's own person and family as
amongst her subjects, her highness did answer
for herself, that she was noways persuaded
that there was any impiety in the
mass, and trusted her subjects would not
press her to act against her conscience; for,
not to dissemble, but to deal plainly with
them, she neither might nor would forsake
the religion wherein she had been educated
and brought up, believing the same to be
the true religion, and grounded on the word
of God. Her loving subjects should know
that she, neither in times past, nor yet in
time coming, did intend to force the conscience
of any person, but to permit every
one to serve God in such manner as they
are persuaded to be the best, that they
likewise would not urge her to any thing
that stood not with the quietness of her
mind."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Nothing," remarks Mr. Hosack,
"could exceed the savage rudeness
of the language of the assembly; nothing
could exceed the dignity and
moderation of the queen's reply." <i>Of
all this, in Mr. Froude's pages, not one
word!</i> Indeed he at all times religiously
keeps out of sight all Mary
says or writes, admitting rarely a few
words under prudent censorship and
liberal expurgation. Sweetly comparing
the assembly to "the children of
Israel on their entrance into Canaan,"
he dissimulates their savage rudeness,
and adds, almost pensively, that Murray,
though he was present, "no
longer raised his voice in opposition."
Randolph fully confirms what Throckmorton
reported four years before&mdash;that
she neither desired to change her
own religion nor to interfere with
that of her subjects. Mary told Knox
the same thing when she routed him,
by his own admission, in profane history,
and his own citations from the
Old Testament. Where she obtained
her familiarity with the Scriptures we
cannot imagine, if Mr. Froude tells
the truth about her "French education."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
"A Catholic sovereign sincerely
pleading to a Protestant assembly
for liberty of conscience, might
have been a lesson to the bigotry of
mankind," (vol. viii. p. 182;) "but,"
adds Mr. Froude, "Mary Stuart was
not sincere." When Mr. Froude says
Mary Stuart is intolerant, we show
him, by a standard universally recognized,
her words and actions, all always
consistent with each other and
with themselves, that she was eminently
tolerant and liberal. But when
he gives us his personal and unsupported
opinion that "she was not sincere,"
he passes beyond the bounds
of historical argument into a realm
where we cannot follow him.</p>

<p>Still greater than Mr. Froude's difficulty
of quoting Mary at all, is his difficulty
of quoting her correctly when
he pretends to. Randolph comes to
Mary with a dictatorial message from
Elizabeth, that she shall not take up
arms against the lords in insurrection.
Mr. Froude calls it a request that she
would do no injury to the Protestant
lords, who were her good subjects.
Mary replied, according to Froude,
(vol. viii. p. 188,) "that Elizabeth
might call them 'good subjects;' she
had found them bad subjects, and as
such she meant to treat them." Mary
really said,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For those whom your mistress calls 'my
<em>best</em> subjects,' I cannot esteem them so, nor
so do they deserve to be accounted of that
that they will not obey my commands; and
therefore my good sister ought not to be
offended if I do that against them as they
deserve."</p></blockquote>

<p>The truth is, Mary's unvarying,
queenly dignity and womanly gentleness
in all she speaks and writes is
a source of profound unhappiness to
Mr. Froude, refuting as it does his
theory of her character. Consequently
it is his aim to vulgarize it down
to a standard in vogue elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Froude is most felicitous when
he disguises Mary, as he frequently
does, with Elizabeth's tortuous drapery.
Thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Open and straightforward conduct did
not suit the complexion of Mary Stuart's
genius; she breathed more freely, and she
used her abilities with better effect, in the
uncertain twilight of conspiracy."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Uncertain twilight" is pretty.
But where were Mary's conspiracies?
Had she Randolphs at Elizabeth's
court, and Drurys on the border,
plotting, intriguing, and bribing English
noblemen? Had she two
thirds of Elizabeth's council of state
pensioned as paid spies? Had she
salaried officials to pick up or invent
English court scandal for her amusement?
Truly it is refreshing to turn
from Mary's twilight conspiracies to
the honest and noble transactions of
Elizabeth, Cecil, and Randolph. But
of the malicious gossip of Elizabeth's
spies one might not so much
complain, if Mr. Froude had the
fairness to give their reports without
his embroidery of rhetoric and imagination.
Thus, when Randolph writes,
"There is a <i>silly story</i> afloat that the
queen <em>sometimes</em> carries a pistol," Mr.
Froude considers himself authorized
by Randolph to say, "She carried
pistols in hand and pistols at her
saddle-bow;" and, as usual, reading
her thoughts, goes on to tell us that
"her one peculiar hope was to destroy
her brother, against whom she
bore an especial and unexplained animosity."
The personal intimacy between
Randolph and Murray more
than sufficiently explains the source
of the information given in Randolph's
letter of Oct. 13th. (Vol. viii. p. 196.)
Mr. Froude has a moment of weakness
when he says that the intimacy
between the queen and Riccio was
so confidential as to provoke calumny.
That any thing said of
Mary Stuart could possibly be calumny
is an admission for Mr. Froude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
only less amazing than that "she was
warm and true in her friendships."
The queen's indignation against Murray
is sufficiently accounted for by
the existence of the calumnies, and
the fact that Murray's treasons sent
him at this time a fugitive to his mistress
Elizabeth. A few pages further
on, we have Mary riding "in steel
bonnet and corselet, with a dagg at
her saddle-bow," (vol. viii. p. 213,) for
which Mr. Froude quotes Randolph.
But Randolph wrote, "<i>If what I
have heard be true</i>, she rode," etc.,
questionable hearsay where Mary
Stuart is concerned, answering Mr.
Froude's purpose somewhat better
than fact.</p>

<p>Through Randolph, Elizabeth announced
to Mary that one of the
conditions on which she would consent
to the Darnley marriage was,
that "she must conform to the religion
established by law." Upon
this, the singular comment is, "It is
interesting to observe how the current
of the reformation had swept
Elizabeth forward in spite of herself."
(Vol. viii. p. 187.) Mary's answer was,
she "would make no merchandise of
her conscience."</p>


<h3>MURRAY'S INSURRECTION.</h3>

<p>At page 198, vol. viii., after the
armed rebellion of Murray and his
friends, popularly known in Scotland
as "The Runabout Raid," we have
Mary</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"breathing nothing but anger and defiance.
The affection of a sister for a brother was
curdled into a hatred the more malignant
because it was more unnatural. Her whole
passion was concentrated on Murray."</p></blockquote>

<p>It must be clear to every one how
reprehensible Mary was for showing
any feeling at all in defence of her
crown, her liberty, and her life, and
with Mr. Froude's premises and logic,
Murray gave a signal proof of affection
for his sister in arraying himself
against her legitimate authority as
the head of an insurrection. Mr.
Froude can see, in the just indignation
of the queen against domestic
traitors in league, with a foreign
power, nothing but the violence of
a vengeful fury. His anxiety to possess
his readers of the same view has
brought him into a serious difficulty,
which has been exposed by M. Wiesener
in his <cite>Marie Stuart</cite>. At p. 211,
vol. viii., Mr. Froude quotes a letter
of Randolph to Cecil of Oct. 5th,
"in Rolls House," by which he
means Record Office, to show that
Mary "was deaf to advice as she
had been to menace," and "she said
<i>she would have no peace till she had
Murray's or Chatelherault's head</i>."
This letter appears to be visible to
nobody but Mr. Froude; and we
have the authority of Mr. Joseph
Stevenson, who is more at home
among the <span class="smcap lowercase">MSS.</span> of the Record Office
than Mr. Froude, and who, when he
uses them, has the merit of citing
them in their integrity, for stating that
this letter of the 5th October, referred
to by Mr. Froude, <i>is not in the Record
Office</i>.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> But there is a letter there
from Randolph to Cecil of the 4th
October, in which Randolph represents
Mary</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"not only uncertain as to what she should
do, but inclined to clement measures, and
so undecided as to hope that matters could
be arranged"!</p></blockquote>

<p>This does not sound like "deaf to
advice," and Mr. Froude can arrange
this little difficulty with the dates
and Mr. Stevenson at his leisure.
Meantime, we all anxiously wait to
hear from Mr. Froude where he found
his authority for stating that Mary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>said she would have no peace till she
had Murray's or Chatelherault's head.</p>

<p>At page 205, vol. viii. the account
given by MauvissiÃ¨re of his interview
with Mary is travestied by Mr.
Froude. MauvissiÃ¨re counselled her
to make peace with the insurgents.
Mary saw through the device; for it
was the counsel of Catherine de' Medici,
whose enmity to Mary was only
surpassed by that of Elizabeth; and,
although without advisers&mdash;for Murray
was in rebellion, Morton had
withdrawn himself, and Maitland was
suspected&mdash;she rejected it instantly.</p>

<p>It is amusing to observe how the
loyal attachment of the citizens and
merchants of Edinburgh to Mary
annoys Mr. Froude. During Mary's
absence, the rebels swept into the city
with a large force; but, notwithstanding
the appeal of the kirk, the "<i>Calvinist
shop-keepers</i>," as Mr. Froude
witheringly styles them, would not
lift a finger to aid them. We call it
amusing, because Mr. Froude everywhere
so undisguisedly manifests his
strong personal sympathy that, as an
historian, he becomes simply absurd.</p>

<p>Mary marched against the rebels
with eighteen thousand men. As
she approached, they fled into England,
and the rebellion was over.</p>

<p>"The Queen of Scots, following in
hot pursuit, glared across the frontier
at her escaping prey." (Vol. viii. p.
214.) The amount of precise information
in Mr. Froude's exclusive
possession concerning the expression
of Mary Stuart's eyes as something
wonderful. Here her eyes "glare;"
elsewhere, (vol. viii. p. 365,) there is
an "odd glitter in her eyes," while at
p. 161, they are "flashing pride and
defiance."</p>

<p>It is this imaginative power and talent
for pictorial embellishment which
lend to Mr. Froude's work such peculiar
attraction for the general reader.
And to give expression to this
natural appreciation, such testimonials
as the following are seriously produced
as evidences of the merit of
the work.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful history it is!"
says Mrs. Mulock Craik; "and wonderful
indeed is it, with its vivid pictures
of scenes and persons long passed
away; its broad charity, its tender
human sympathy, its ever present dignity,
its outbursts of truest pathos."</p>

<p>All this is in keeping with the eternal
fitness of things. This excellent
lady, a somewhat successful writer of
novels, really means what she says,
and expresses herself in all sincerity.
Her admiration is genuine. It is
that of a pupil for her master, and
she ingenuously admires one who has
attained excellence in his art. We
have not the slightest doubt that many
will say with her, "What a wonderful
history it is!"</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>For three consecutive mornings of
a certain month of May not far distant,
Blanch and I had opened our
diaries to write, "Wind E. N. E."</p>

<p>Every body knows what that means
in Boston. It means chill and grayness
and drizzle; it means melancholy-shining
sidewalks and puddles <i>Ã 
surprise</i> just where the foot is most
confidingly planted; it means water
dripping over gutters, flowing frothily
from spouts, and squishing from
shoes of poor folks at every step they
take; it means draggled skirts, and
cross looks, and influenza, and bronchitis,
and a disposition to believe
in the total depravity of inanimate
things.</p>

<p>Yes; but also it means an effervescence
of spirit in those rare souls, like
incarnate sunshine, kindred in some
sort of "Epictetus, a slave, maimed
in body, an Irus in poverty, and favored
by the immortals."</p>

<p>But&mdash;three whole days of drizzle!</p>

<p>On the first day, Blanch and I
glanced approvingly skyward, and
said, "A fine rain!" then went about
that inevitable clearing out of drawers
and closets and reading of old letters,
which a rainy day suggests to the feminine
mind.</p>

<p>On the second morning, we donned
water-proofs and over-shoes, and boldly
sallied forth, coming in later breathless,
glowing, drenched, and with our
hair curled up into kinks. Then, subsiding
a little, we drew down the crimson
curtains, lighted a fire, lighted the
gas, and, shutting ourselves into that
rosy cloister, read till we were sleepy.</p>

<p>But sometimes water looks a great
deal wetter than it does at other times;
and on the third morning it looked
very wet indeed. The damp, easterly
gloom entered between our eyelids
and penetrated to our souls. We
struck our colors. Like the Sybarite
who got a pain in his back from seeing
some men at work in the field,
we shivered in sympathy with every
passing wretch.</p>

<p>That prince of blunderers, Sir Boyle
Roche, used to say that the best way
to avoid danger is to meet it plumb.
Acting on that principle, Blanch and
I took each a chair and a window,
and, seating ourselves, stared silently
in the face of the enemy.</p>

<p>After an hour or so, I began to feel
the benefit of the baronet's prescription.</p>

<p>"Blanch," said I, brightening, "let's
go on a lark down to Maine, to the
northern part of Hancock County, to
a place I know."</p>

<p>Blanch turned her small, white face
toward me, gave me a reproachful
glance out of her pale-blue eyes, then
drew her shawl closer about her throat,
and resumed her gaze in the face of
out-doors.</p>

<p>I waited a moment, then pursued,
"Rain in town and rain in the country
are two reigns, as the histories say.
Lilies shrugging up their white shoulders,
and roses shaking their pink
faces to get rid of the drops; trees
lucent green jewels in every leaf; birds
laughing and scolding at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
time, casting bright little jokes from
leafy covert to covert; brooks foaming
through their channels like champagne
out of bottles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never compare a greater thing
to a less," interrupted Blanch, severe
and rhetorical.</p>

<p>"So you think rain-water is better
than champagne?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No matter. Go on with your
poetics."</p>

<p>"At this time the apple-trees are
pink clouds of incense, and the cherry-trees
are white clouds of incense,
the maples are on fire; there are fresh
light-green sprouts on the dark-green
spruces; the flaky boughs of the cedars
have put forth pale, spicy buds;
and the silver birches glimmer under
hovering mists of green. Deer are
stealing out of the woods to browse in
the openings, and gray rabbits hop
across the long, still road, (there is but
one road.) The May-flowers are
about gone; but dandelions, "spring's
largess," are everywhere. Here and
there is a clearing, over which the
surrounding wildness has thrown a
gentle savagery, like lichen over rocks.
The people (there are two) live in a
log house. They never get a newspaper
till it is weeks old, perhaps not
so soon, and they know nothing of
fashion. If we should appear to them
now with our skirts slinking in at the
ankles, and puffing out at the waist,
with chignons on our heads and hats
on our noses, they would run into the
house and button the doors. Every
thing there is peaceful. Rumors of
oppression, fraud, and war reach them
not. I should not be surprised if
that were one of the places where they
still vote for General Jackson. Their
most frequent visitors are bears, and
wolves, and snappish little yellow
foxes. In short, you have no idea
how delightful the place is."</p>

<p>"I am not like the Queen of Sheba,"
says Blanch. "Though the
half had not been told me, my imagination
would have out-built and
out-hung and out-shone Solomon in
all his glory. Who are these people?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Sally Smith.
Sally lived with my mother as help
when I was a little girl. On my
tenth birthday, she gave me my first
smelling-bottle, purple glass with a
silver-washed screw-top. The season
was July, and the day very warm.
After holding my precious present in
my hand awhile, I opened it, and, in
the innocence of my heart, took a deliberate
snuff. The result beggars
description. When I became capable
of thought, I believed that the top
of my head had been blown off. You
remember in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> the
bottle out of which, when it was
unstopped, a demon escaped? Well,
that was the same bottle. Sally used
to boil molasses candy for me; and
she has braided my hair and boxed
my ears many a time. But mother
didn't allow her to box my ears.
Thomas lived in our town, and tried to
support himself and make a fortune by
keeping a market, but with slight success.
He was always behindhand,
and never got the dinner home till the
cook was at the point of distraction.
They called him the late Mr. Smith.
By and by he and Sally got married,
after a courtship something like that
of Barkis and Pegotty, and went into
the woods to live. My mother made
and gave Sally her wedding-cake, one
large loaf and four smaller ones. The
large one would have been larger if
my brother Dick and I hadn't got at
it before it was baked and ate ever so
much. Did you ever eat raw cake?
It is real good. I paid Sally a visit
long ago, and she made me promise
to come again."</p>

<p>"I dare say it is all moon-shine,"
said Blanch, rising. "But, here goes."</p>

<p>"Where to?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"To pack my trunks for a visit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
Sally Smith," answered Blanch from
the doorway.</p>

<p>"But I was in fun."</p>

<p>"And I am in earnest."</p>

<p>"And perhaps the facts are not so
fair as the fancies."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for the facts."</p>

<p>With which quotation the young
woman disappeared.</p>

<p>Resistance was useless. Blanch is
one of those gentle, yielding creatures
who always have their own way.
And I love to be tyrannized over. I
followed her up-stairs, repeating ruefully,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Since then I never dared to be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As funny as I can."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Catch me being poetic again!</p>

<p>That very evening a letter was
mailed to Sally Smith, announcing our
coming; and in less than a week we
started, lingering over the first part
of our journey, that due preparation
might be made for our entertainment.
The last day and a half were to be
an allegro movement.</p>

<p>The drive from Bucksport to Ellsworth
was delightful; not the beginning
of it, where twelve persons were
crowded into a nine-passenger coach;
where Blanch, looking like a wilted
flower, sat wedged between two large,
determined women; where my neighbor
was a restless man who was constantly
trying to get something out
of the coat-pocket next me; and an
aesthetic man, who insisted on looking
past my nose at the prospect; and a
tobacco-chewing man, as his breath in
my face fully testified: all this was
not delightful. But after we had entreated
the driver, and been assisted
to a perch on the coach-roof, then it
was glorious.</p>

<p>Then we got airy tosses instead of
dislocating jolts; saw the road unwind,
turn by turn, from the woods;
saw how the grating brake was put
to the wheel while we crept over the
brow of a steep pitch, then let go
while we spun down the lower part
and flew over the level.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun was behind us,
and gilded the hills; but the hollows
were full of transparent dusk with the
crowding, overhanging woods. As
we came up out of them, our horses
strained forward to trample on a
giant shadow-coach, with four shadow-horses,
a shadow-driver, and two fly-away
shadow-women in advance of
every thing else.</p>

<p>Presently the boughs ceased to
catch at our veils, the woods thinned
and withdrew, houses appeared and
multiplied, and we came out on to a
long steep hill dipping to a river,
whence another long steep hill rose at
the other side. And built up and
down, and to right and left, was a
pretty town with all its white houses
rose-red in the sunset. Well might
it blush under our faithful eyes!</p>

<p>"Blanch," I said, "behold a town
where, sixteen years ago, a Catholic
priest almost won the crown of martyrdom.
On the hill opposite, toward
the south, stood the Catholic church
that was burned, and the Catholic
school-house that was blown up with
gunpowder. There is the cottage
where the priest lived. One August
evening, when the sky was like a
topaz with sunset, and the new moon
was out, he baptized me there, and
a little while after they broke his windows
with stones. Further up the
hill is the house from which, one rainy
Saturday night, a mob of masked
men dragged him. Ah well! that
story is yet to be told."</p>


<h3>II.<br />

HE AND SHE.</h3>

<p>The next morning early, we started
on our last day's journey, and were
driven through a rough country, the
road dwindling till it seemed likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
imitate that avenue which narrowed
till it turned into a squirrel-track and
ran up a tree. At five o'clock, we
stopped at a farm-house, which was
also post-office; and there we got a
man to take us to our journey's end.</p>

<p>"May be you'll take this letter with
you," the postmaster said. "It's for
Miss Smith."</p>

<p><em>Mrs.</em> is never heard in that region.</p>

<p>I took that letter, and gazed at it
a moment in wrathful silence. There
was my annunciatory epistle written
to Sally Smith more than a fortnight
before!</p>

<p>"Allah il Allah!" sighed Blanch
resignedly when I held up the letter
to her view.</p>

<p>The road over which we now drove
was streaked with grass that tempted
the lowered nose of our Rozinante,
and graceful clusters of buttercups
brushed the slow spokes of our wheels.
The forest primeval shut down, solid
and precipitous, at our left, and at
our right the scrubby spruces clambered
and straggled over the ledges with
the appearance of having just stopped
to look at us; and in a little while we
saw through their tops a log house
that stood at the head of a rocky lane.
A thin wreath of smoke curled from
the stone chimney, curtains of spotless
whiteness showed inside the tiny
hinged windows, and a luxuriant hopvine
draped all the wall next us. Not
a rod back from the house, and drawn
darkly against the sunset sky, was a
picture very like DorÃ©'s bringing of
the ark to Bethsames. A group of
cattle stood there motionless, two
low-bending spruce-trees unfurled
their plumy branches over a square
rock, and, as motionless as either,
stood a tall, gaunt woman staring
fixedly at us.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" cried Blanch
sharply, "the child will shoot us!"</p>

<p>Following her glance, I espied a
tow-headed urchin of ten, may be,
whom our coming had petrified in
the act of getting through the bars at
the foot of the lane. Against the
lower bar rested his rifle, the muzzle
looking us directly in the eye.</p>

<p>I seized upon him and changed
his aim.</p>

<p>"Your name is Larkin," I said accusingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am!" he answered in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p>"What are you here for?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am sent me to borrow Miss
Smith's darn'-needle," he whimpered.</p>

<p>"You have come four miles through
the woods to borrow a darning-needle?"
I demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am!" he answered, eagerly
pointing to a huge needle with a
blue yarn which was sewed into his
blue drilling shirt-front.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Sally Smith alive?" I asked
solemnly.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"Does she live in this house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"Does any one else live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith."</p>

<p>"Well, set your rifle down here in
the corner of the fence, and look out
how you aim it another time. There!
now take this letter and carry it up to
Mrs. Smith, and give her my compliments,
and say that we would like
a reply at her earliest convenience.
We may be addressed at the foot of
the lane, sitting on our trunks."</p>

<p>As I released his arm, he shot wildly
up the lane, and tumbled headlong
in at the weather-porch that guarded
the northern door.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, a woman's head
appeared and took an observation,
while her two hands were visible
smoothing her hair and rapidly adjusting
an apron. Then the whole
long figure emerged. At first she
walked warily, stopping once or twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
as though about to turn back; then
she gave a long look, and hurried
down the lane, a broad smile breaking
out, token of recognition. Her
voice reached me first, "Well, I do
declare, I'm tickled most to death to
see you!"</p>

<p>With the last words came a mighty
grip of the hands, and Sally looked
at me with eyes overflowing with tears
and gladness.</p>

<p>Most exquisite and dignified reader,
didst thou ever think, when raising
to thy lips the cut-glass goblet of iced
water, poured from a silver pitcher
filled at a faucet supplied through a
leaden pipe that in its turn is fed by
miles of underground aqueduct, that
thou wouldst like rather to slake thy
thirst at some natural spring bubbling
over mossy stones and prostrate
grasses? For once or twice, may be?
If so, all hail! for thou art not quite
a mummy. Underneath thy social
swathings still beats a faint echo of
the bounding pulse of some free-born
ancestor, a sheik of the desert, a dusky
forest-chief, a patriarch of the tents.
Trampled on, thou wilt not turn to
dust, but to fire; and the papyrus is
unfinished on which shall be written
the story of thy life.</p>

<p>There have been times, too, in
which thou hast thought that not
only thy drink was far-fetched and
no sweeter for the fetching, but that
the smiles, the welcomes, the fare-wells,
the friendships were all stale
and unrefreshing. Thou hast longed
for the generous love, which, while
it will bear nothing from thee, will
bear all things for thee; for the honest
hate that carries its blade in
sight, and lurks not in sly and sanctimonious
speech and downcast eyes;
for the noble tongue that knows not
how to tell the spirit of a lie and
save the letter.</p>

<p>Here now before me were all
these. Refreshing, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n'est ce pas?</i> and
very delightful&mdash;for a time.</p>

<p>Blanch and I were whirled into
the house in the midst of a tornado
of welcomes, apologies, regrets, wonderings,
and questions innumerable.
But as we were whisked through the
kitchen, I had time to see all the old
landmarks; the great stone fire-place,
with a mantel-piece nearly out of
reach, the bed, with its bright patch-work
quilt, the broom of cedar-boughs
behind the door, the strip-bottom
chairs, the large blocks to eke out
with when more seats were needed,
the rough walls, the immaculate neatness.</p>

<p>There were two rooms in the
house, and we were suffered to sit
only when we had reached the second.
This was glorious with pictorial
newspapers pasted over the log walls,
with a Job's patience quilt on the bed,
with two painted wooden chairs, and
a chintz-covered divan, a rag mat on
the floor, two brass candlesticks on
the mantel-piece, a looking-glass six
inches long, and a gay picture of a
yellow-haired, praying Samuel, dressed
in a blue night-gown, and kneeling
on a red cushion.</p>

<p>Sally was so delightedly flustered
by our coming that, as she said, she did
not know whether she was on her head
or her heels, a doubt which so sensibly
affected her movements that she was
every moment making little inconsequent
rushes where she had no need
to go, and repeating the same things
over and over.</p>

<p>Presently she sat still with a start,
and listened to a heavy step that
came through the porch and into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h! There he comes!" she
whispered.</p>

<p>In fact, I had already caught a
glimpse through the chimney-back
of a man in his shirt-sleeves, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
hung up a tattered straw hat, and
took down from its nail a tin washbasin
with a long handle, like a skillet.</p>

<p>"Sally!" he called out, splashing a
dipperful of water into the basin.</p>

<p>"Whot?" returned Sally, with a
facetious nod at me.</p>

<p>"Who's been here this afternoon?
I see wagon-tracks down in the
road."</p>

<p>"Boarders!" says Sally, with another
nod and wink.</p>

<p>"Boarders? What for?" came in
a tone of amazement; and through a
chink in the rock chimney I could
see his wet face turned, listening for
her answer, and his dripping hands
suspended.</p>

<p>"To get boarded," replied Sally
succinctly.</p>

<p>Such an astounding announcement
required immediate explanation, and
Mr. Smith was coming in a dripping
state to demand one, when his wife
jumped up to intercept him.</p>

<p>"Guess who's come!" she said,
stopping him in the entry.</p>

<p>"Who?" he asked in a stentorian
whisper.</p>

<p>"Mary!" says dear Sally, with a
little burst of gladness that brought
tears to my eyes.</p>

<p>"Mary who?"&mdash;with the same
preposterous feint of secrecy.</p>

<p>"Why, bobolink Mary, you great
goose!"</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed
Mr. Smith, and as he spoke, his face,
with wide-open eyes and mouth, appeared
over Sally's shoulder, then
disappeared instantly at sight of
Blanch. Nor would our host permit
me to come to him, nor make
himself visible again till he had gone
through a tremendous scrubbing and
brushing, all of which was perfectly
audible to us. Then he came in,
sleek and shining, and gave us a
hearty though embarrassed welcome,
bowing before Blanch with a movement
like the shutting up of a pocket-knife,
and greatly confused on finding
himself obliged to take her small
hand.</p>

<p>I am bound to say that Blanch
behaved exquisitely. She could not
help being dainty and delicate; but
she showed herself so unaffectedly
delighted with every thing and every
body that her daintiness was not remembered
against her. Besides, she
had the good taste not to try to imitate
their rough ways, but remained
simply herself.</p>

<p>Sally disappeared presently, and in
a surprisingly short space of time returned
to tell us, with a very red face,
that supper was ready.</p>

<p>There was a momentary cloud of
doubt over Blanch's face; but I went
unfearing, and the event justified my
confidence. The coarsest of delf, to
be sure, and a cotton cloth, and steel
forks, and a tin coffee-pot. But whatever
could be polished shone like the
sun, and whatever could be white
was like snow. As to the supper, it
was worthy of the pen of Mr. Secretary
Pepys. The traditional delicacies
of a country table are taken for
granted; but the coffee was a glorious
work of supererogation, and delicious
enough to be handed about in the
paradise of Mohammedans. Besides
this, Sally, with a recollection of one
of my mother's pretty ways, had laid
a sprig of fragrant sweet-brier beside
each plate, and with mine a drowsy
dandelion just shutting its golden
rays.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me for giving
you deer meat," said our hostess with
great humility; "I haven't any other
kind on hand to-day; but to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short in the act of setting
the dish on the table, unspeakably
mortified by the incredulous stare
with which Blanch regarded her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you don't like it&mdash;" she began
stammering.</p>

<p>We immediately explained that
Blanch was simply astonished at an
apology being offered with venison,
whereat Sally grew radiant.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith did not appear at the
table. He insisted that he had been
to supper, but abstained from mentioning
the day on which he last partook
of that meal. Indeed, during
all the time Blanch and I were in
that house we never saw the master
of it eat one mouthful.</p>

<p>"He never will sit down with
folks," Sally whispered privately to
me as we left the table.</p>

<p>When Sally said "he," pure and
simple, she always meant her husband.
She had a dim consciousness
that there were other, nebulous masculines
in the world; but to her mind
Mr. Thomas Smith was the bright
particular HE.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock we went to bed
by the pure, pale twilight of June,
and sank up to our eyes in feathers.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Blanch, "I'm going
through to China!"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" I said encouragingly,
"to-morrow we will put this
absurd puff-ball underneath, and promote
the straw-bed."</p>

<p>"Straw!" exclaimed a voice from
the depths.</p>

<p>"Yes! pretty, yellow, shining straws,
such as you suck mint-juleps through.
Well, don't get excited! Straws such
as your brother Tom sucks mint-juleps
through. Good-night, honey!"</p>

<p>I heard her whisper a prayer. Then
we dropped asleep peacefully; while
with steadfast eyes of holy fire our
angels kept watch and ward.</p>


<h3>III.<br />

BIPEDS WITH FEATHERS.</h3>

<p>The next morning the unaccustomed
stillness woke us early; and there
was a long, golden beam of sunlight
stretched across the bare floor. The
hop-leaves hanging over the eastern
window were translucent, and more
gold than green, and all round their
edges hung radiant drops of dew,
slowly gathering and falling.</p>

<p>Blanch smiled, but said nothing,
scarcely spoke a word to God, even,
I think, but knelt and let her prayer
exhale from her, like dew from the
morning earth.</p>

<p>The kitchen was all in order when
we went out. It was shaded, exquisitely
clean, swept through by a soft
draught, and finely perfumed by the
new cedar broom which Thomas had
made that morning. In the fire-place
lay a heap of hard-wood coals in a
solid glow, but the heat of them all
went up chimney. The table was
set for two, and breakfast ready all
but cooking the eggs. Sally held a
bowl of these in her hand, while, outside,
the hens were making loud affidavit
to their freshness.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Blanch put on a
little scarlet sack, took her parasol,
and went out to reconnoitre. Sally
and I staid in the house and talked
over old times, while she washed the
dishes and I wiped them. Old times,
even the happiest, are sad to recall,
and we soon fell into silence. In
that pause, Sally wrung out her dish-cloth,
gave it a scientific shake that
made it snap like a whip-lash, and
hung it up on two nails to dry. Then
she wiped her eyes on her sleeve.</p>

<p>"Land sakes!" she exclaimed,
"what's that?" and rushed out doors,
catching the broom on her way. I
followed with the shovel, for "that"
was a scream which unmistakably
came from Blanch.</p>

<p>There was neither savage nor wild
beast in sight, nor was Blanch visible;
but there was a great commotion in
the poultry-yard, and a large turkey-gobbler
of a military appearance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
strutting about in full feather and declaiming
in some foreign language.
It sounded like low Dutch. What
he said seemed to make a great impression
on the hens and geese, for
they looked awe-struck.</p>

<p>Presently we espied Blanch at the
very top of one of the highest board
fences that ever was built, clinging
for dear life.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I ever got
here," she said piteously. "The last
recollection I have is of that horrid
creature ruffling himself all up and
coming at me. Then I came right
up. And that's all I know. But I
can't get down again."</p>

<p>I got a little ladder and helped
Blanch down from her dangerous
perch, while Sally kept the turkey-gobbler
at bay, standing, broom in
hand, in that position called in heraldry
rampant-regardant.</p>

<p>"He doesn't like scarlet very well,"
she remarked. "It isn't his favorite
color."</p>

<p>Then we went to see Mrs. Partington,
a large gray hen, which was that
morning taking her first airing with a
new brood. She had been set on
goose-eggs, which had, naturally,
hatched out goslings; but she did not
know it.</p>

<p>"Now," said Sally, "if you want
to see an astonished hen, come along."</p>

<p>There was a duck-pond near, and
some instinct in the goslings led them
that way. Mrs. Partington yielded,
like a fond, indulgent mother, and
clucked along full of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naÃ¯ve</i> consequence
and good-nature. But at a
little distance from the margin she
paused, called her brood about her,
and began to talk to them in a gray,
comfortable, complacent voice. I
suppose she was telling them how
dangerous water is. They listened
first with one side of their heads, then
with the other, and two of them
winked at each other, and made little
irresistible shies toward the pond.
They looked like green eggs on two
sticks. The hen left off her lecture,
clucked loudly, spread her wings, and
ran after them. But the next instant
a shriek broke from her bill; for, as
every body knows, of course, the goslings
all plunged headlong into the
pond.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Partington was, indeed,
an astonished hen. She was more:
she was a transfixed hen. She stood
gazing at them in horror, evidently
expecting to see every one of them
keel over and go to the bottom. But
no; the little voyagers floated about
quite at their ease, striking out with
their tiny paddles, their downy backs
and absurd little heads shedding the
water beautifully.</p>

<p>"She must know now that they are
goslings," said Blanch.</p>

<p>"Goslings? Not she!" answered
Sally. "Ten to one she thinks that
she is a goose. No, that hen will
go down to the platter without finding
out that she has been cheated."</p>

<p>We had a busy day. We went to
see the frame-house that Mr. Smith
had begun to raise, and Sally's dairy
in the cellar of it; we promoted our
straw-bed, filled our fireplace with
pine boughs, thus cutting off the view
through the chimney-back; unpacked
our trunks and set up our graven
images; and, when sunset was near,
went out into the woods at the foot
of Spruce Mountain to get a pail of
water from a little Johannisberger of
a spring there. The mountain was
between us and the sunset, and the
woods were in shadow; but up over
the lofty tree-tops the red and golden
lights floated past, and every little
pool, among its treasures of reflected
foliage, airy nest of bird, and bending
flower, held warmly its bit of azure
sky, and crimson or golden cloud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
Presently we came to where, at the
foot of a spruce-tree, our spring lay
like a fire-opal, with that one spark
down among its haunting shadows.
A cool green darkness fell into it from
the overhanging boughs, velvet mosses
growing close rimmed it with a
brighter emerald, gray of trunk,
branch, and twig melted into it, milky
little flowers nodded over at their
milky little twins below, and in the
midst burned that live coal of the
sunset. When we plunged our tin
pail into this spring, it was as though
we were going to dip up jewels. But
instantly we touched the water, it
whitened all over with a silvery-rippled
mail, the colors disappeared, and
we brought up only crystal clearness.
The next moment, though, the throbbing
waters subsided, and the many-tinted
enchantment stole tremulously
back again.</p>

<p>When we went to bed that night, a
shower was prowling about the horizon,
and over on Spruce Mountain the
wolves were howling back defiance
to the thunders.</p>

<p>What a lovely, savage week it was
that followed! Somewhere in it was
dissolved a Sunday; but we were
scarcely aware of it, there was so little
to mark the day.</p>

<p>In that week we learned one fact
that was new to us, and that was the
profound melancholy that reigns in
the woods. Looking back, we could
recollect that the impression had always,
though unconsciously, been the
same. Is it that in the forest Pan
alone is the chosen god? and that
there is still mourned that day when</p>

<p class="center">
"The parting genius was with sighing rent."<br />
</p>

<p>Or is the sadness because He who
once came down to walk among the
trees, and call through the dews,
comes no more?</p>

<p>Whatever may be the reason, melancholy
is enthroned in the forest.</p>


<h3>IV.<br />

A DIAMOND-WASHING.</h3>

<p>On one of those days, Blanch and
I, after a severe dispute on the subject
with Sally, did a washing. Sally
said we shouldn't; but wash we would,
and wash we did.</p>

<p>We rose at early white dawn, kilted
up our wrappers, shouldered our
clothes-bag, took soap, matches, and
kindlings, and started. A path led
us past the new frame-house and a
grove beyond it to the wash-room.
This was a noble apartment about
forty rods long by thirty wide, and
was walled in by cedar and pine columns
with the branches and foliage
left on, a great improvement on Solomon's
building. The cornice was
delicately traced against a pale-blue
ceiling frescoed with silver, the most
beautiful ceiling I have ever seen.
The carpet was a green velvet pile,
thickly diapered with small gold-colored
and white flowers in an irregular
pattern, and beaded all over with
crystals. Near the door by which
we entered was one of the most
charming imitations of rustic scenery
to be found at home or abroad. A
huge granite boulder, broken and hollowed
roughly, had a thread of sparkling
water bubbling up through a rift
in it, and overflowing its basin in a
rivulet. Near this stood two forked
poles with a large copper kettle suspended
from a cross-pole. Underneath
the kettle were the ashes of
more than one fire. Countless birds
flew about, singing as well as if they
had been sent to Paris. On the
whole, it was a picture which would
have drawn a crowd at any exhibition.</p>

<p>Wood was there, covered from the
dew with green boughs. We placed
our kindlings, lighted them with a
match scraped inside Blanch's slipper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
and soon a blue column of
smoke was rising straight into the
morning air, and the flames were
growing. Then we filled the great
kettle with water from the fountain
of Arethusa, and, as soon as it was
warm, began to wash. For one hour
there was nothing but silence and
scrubbing; then a loud war-whoop
through Sally's hands announced that
breakfast was ready. By that time
our clothes were all washed and
bubbling in the boiler. Looking
about then, we saw that every cedar
pillar had a golden capital; cloth of
gold was spread here and there in
long stretches, and the frescoes had
changed their shape, and, instead of
silver, were rosy and golden.</p>

<p>Poor Sally, looking at us ruefully
when we went in, asked to see our
hands. They were worth looking at,
all the skin being off the backs of
them, and the insides puckered up
into the most curious and complex
wrinkles. We ate with glorious appetites,
though, had another engagement
with Sally, who wanted us to lie
down to rest, and have our hands bandaged,
and went back to find our
clothes wabbling clumsily, but quite
to our satisfaction. We upset our tubs
and rinsed them, then set them up
and filled with cold water again. Next
we took each a clothes-stick, fished
something from the kettle with it, ran
with it boiling hot at the stick's end,
and soused it into one of the tubs.
We had to run a good many times,
probably a mile in all. We squeezed
the clothes out of this pickle, called
by the initiated "boiled suds;" refilled
our tubs, and performed that last operation
"of rinsing," which took the
puckered insides quite out of our
hands, leaving them almost innocent
of cuticle.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Blanch, as we
spread our washing out on the green,
"every woman on earth ought to do
one washing. It would do their souls
good, though it should temporarily
damage their bodies. My laundress
is a new being to me from this day.
I mean to double her wages."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed suddenly,
and held up the bleeding forefinger
of her left hand. "My ring! I have
lost it; it is washed away."</p>

<p>The poor child looked distressed,
and no wonder; for the missing cluster
was a <i>souvenir</i>.</p>

<p>We set ourselves to search, but in
vain. On each side of our grassy
bench, three tubs of water had been
spilt, and had wandered in devious
ways, and to some distance. We
sawed our sore fingers on the notched
edges of the grass-blades, to no
purpose.</p>

<p>"It was careless of you, Blanch,"
I said austerely. "You should have
recollected that the ring was loose&mdash;"</p>

<p>A twinkle appeared in Blanch's
eyes, if not on her finger. I followed
the direction of her significant glance,
and behold! where the lambent <i>solitaire</i>
had burned on my hand, was
an aching void!</p>

<p>"My angel," said Blanch sweetly,
"did you ever hear of diamond-washings?"</p>


<h3>V.<br />

A MISS IS AS GOOD AS A MILE.</h3>

<p>When Sunday came round a second
time, we were aware of it.
Every day had been to us like a crystal
brimming cup overflowing to quench
the day's thirst; but looking out into
this Sunday, we saw only a golden
emptiness.</p>

<p>Tears hung on Blanch's long eyelashes.
"Think of all the blessed
open church-doors," she said. "It
makes me homesick. I want to go
to mass. Even a fiddling, frescoed,
full-dress mass would be better than
none."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span></p>

<p>I quoted my friend, Sir Boyle
Roche, "'Can a man be like a bird,
in two places at once?' Besides, little
one, if you were in town, it is not
unlikely that you might stay at home
all day because your new hat was not
becoming, or because of the hot sun,
or the east wind, or the mud, or the
dust."</p>

<p>The dear child blushed. "But
then one likes to know that one can
go," she said meekly.</p>

<p>Sally and her husband were going
five miles to meeting that day. They
started early; and we watched them
go soberly off in single file till the
trees hid first the large brim of Sally's
preposterous bonnet, then the crown
of Mr. Smith's antique hat. Then
we went in and prepared a little altar,
with a statuette of the Virgin, a crucifix,
candles and flowers, and, lifting
up our hearts in that wild solitude,
assisted at some far-away mass.
There was no interruption, only a
group of deer stood without, at the
distance of a stone's throw, as motionless
as gray marble statues, and
watched us with soft, intent eyes.
After we had got through and were
sitting silently, the candles still burning,
some Roman Catholic hummingbirds
dashed in and sucked the honey
out of the wild roses we had given
our Lady, but left a sweet thought instead.
When the buzz of their wings
was gone, we heard robins and a
bobolink outside, and a chorus of
little twitterers singing a Laudate.
"Amen!" said Blanch. The unclouded
sunlight steeped the surrounding
forest in sultry splendor,
and clouds of perfume rose, like incense,
from pine, and fir, and hemlock,
from thousands of little blossoms,
from plots of red and white
clover, heavy with honey, from censers
of anemones, and, threading all
these sweets of sound, perfume, and
sight together, was the bubbling voice
of a brook murmuring Paters and
Aves over its pebbles.</p>

<p>Blanch smiled, and repeated softly:</p>

<p>When Sally and Mr. Smith came
home that afternoon, they were accompanied
by a tall, stiff, severe man
in black, at the first sight of whom
Blanch and I got our hats for a walk.
It was Elder Samson, come up to
convert the idolaters. We knew well
what hydra-headed discourse he had
prepared to devour our patience, our
charity, our civility even. Discretion
was the better part of valor, we concluded,
and fled, leaving, alas! the
statuette of our Lady, with the candles
burning beside her, and the wild
roses clinging about and kissing her
feet. If we had but known! But
we did not then, nor till long afterward.
When we came back, every
thing was, apparently, as we had left
it. But, when Sally came to town in
the fall, she told how, the moment
the elder saw our graven image, he
flew into a holy rage, flung it, roses
and all, out the window, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
have flung the candles after it, if she
had not rescued them by main force.
The result was an illustration of the
church militant, in which rather high
words passed between Sally and the
elder. Mr. Smith, feebly interposing
to take the part of his clerical visitor,
was routed utterly.</p>

<p>But meantime, in happy unconsciousness,
Blanch and I walked
down the road, and down and down
the road, a mile, and another mile,
and again a mile, through the green
and flowery solitude, flecked and
flickering with sunlight and shadow,
the silence only softly stirred by a multitudinous
rustling of leaves. Now
and then we saw a deer by the road-side;
and far away in the woods the
foxes snarled and barked.</p>

<p>Our walk ended on a long log that
bridged a brook, and there we stood
and looked up to see the waters
come down to us. Presently, instead
of their flowing down, we seemed to
float up. We were going up to the
cradle of this dancing stream, to
some enchanted land where the baby
rivulet first saw the sun. We were
going back, also, to our own childhood,
floating up and up to careless
days, leaving the heavy years behind.</p>

<p>When we came back from that
far-away country, a little sea-sick with
our journey, I turned to see Blanch
looking at me with great attention.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, "you are the
most absurd figure I recollect to have
seen in the whole course of my life.
If it were not deplorable that human
taste should be so perverted, I should
find you ludicrous."</p>

<p>"So you have found it out," I replied,
highly edified. "I have been
thinking the same of you this week
past. Of course any one with eyes
can see that Sally in her straight
gown and big apron, with her hair in
a pug, is better dressed than we."</p>

<p>Blanch had brought Mr. Smith's
pistol with her. She always took it
when we went into the woods; for
she considered herself a pretty good
shot. She had at home a pasteboard
target full of little holes, the best one
about six inches from the centre, all
made by shots fired by her at a distance
of twenty feet.</p>

<p>She felt safer to take the pistol,
she said; for if any animal were to
attack us, she could be sure to wound
if not to kill it. "No animal," she
argued very sensibly, "could be dangerous
at a distance of twenty feet
or more. And if he should come
within that, I could not fail hitting
pretty near his head or heart. You
see, I missed only six inches in the
shooting-gallery, and a bear or a
wolf would be much larger than my
target."</p>

<p>When you want to convince others,
always speak as though your proposition
is unquestionable. Every body
knows that the majority of persons
in the majority of cases find it troublesome
to think for themselves, and
that if you are positive enough, you
can make them believe any thing.
If Blanch had been a shade less logical
and decided, I might have submitted
that a pasteboard target does
not pounce upon you and hug you
to death, or tear you into inch pieces
while you are taking aim, and that
with a wild live creature to glare
back with two great threatening eyes
into her one blue eye looking at him,
like a murderous violet, over the pistol-barrel,
her nerves might be shaken
to the extent of another six inches
from the mark. But her air was one
of such perfect conviction that my
subjunctive case expired without a
sigh.</p>

<p>The tree-tops were still full of sunshine
when we started to go home,
but the road was shaded. Blanch
seemed a little uneasy.</p>

<p>"I believe we'd be awful good to
eat," she said apprehensively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
Even in speaking, she stopped
short, I stopped, we stopped all two,
as the French say. Directly in front
of us and not far away, sitting with
an air of deliberation in the middle
of the road, was a large, clumsy,
shaggy beast that looked at us with
an inexplicable expression. I had
never had the pleasure of an introduction
to this animal, but none was
needed. I had seen his portrait on
the outside of hair-oil bottles. The
resemblance was striking.</p>

<p>Blanch turned very red, and raised
her pistol.</p>

<p>"Shall I fire?" asked the little heroine
in a stage-whisper.</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>Her hand was trembling like a leaf
in the wind; but she took beautiful
aim, and I am bound to confess that
her pasteboard target could not have
received the attention with more unmoved
tranquillity. The pistol went
hard, though, and the pull she had to
give the trigger brought the muzzle
down, so that instead of the shot
striking within six inches of the bear's
heart or brain, it struck up a little
puff of dust, and took off the devoted
head of a buttercup about five feet
from us.</p>

<p>"Have I hit him?" she asked
breathlessly, opening her eyes. She
had shut them very tight on firing.</p>

<p>She had not hit him; but he took
the hint, and got himself clumsily out
of the way. I thought he acted as
though his feelings were hurt.</p>

<p>I have forgotten whether we ran.
I am inclined to think that we did
not. But we were not long in getting
home, and then the elder was gone.</p>


<h3>VI.<br />

HOMESICK.</h3>

<p>A pathetic little incident happened
that week, which suggested many
thoughts to us. Passing by a cleared
space in the woods one afternoon, Mr.
Smith saw a deer family quietly grazing
there. Plentiful as these creatures
were in that region, they never suffered
a near approach; but this group
looked at the intruder peacefully and
showed no sign of alarm.</p>

<p>Is there on earth an animal more
fierce and cruel than man in deed if
not in intention? This man did not
deliberately mean to perpetrate a fiendish
act; but no otherwise could what
he did be characterized. He did not
want the venison, the skins, the graceful
antlers; but he fancied it rather a
fine thing to have that bounding target
still for a moment. His rifle was
over his shoulder; he lowered it, and
took aim at the stag's stately front.
There was a report; the creature gave
one leap into the air, then fell, shot
through the forehead.</p>

<p>Not even then did the others fly.
While he loaded his rifle again, they
bent over their prostrate companion,
touching him, moved by what mute,
incredulous grief, who can say? The
marksman gleefully took aim again,
and the doe fell with a bullet through
her heart, and sobbed her life away.
When Mr. Smith saw the young one
put its head down to the mother's, for
the first time some compunction touched
his coarse, unsympathetic soul.
But he had gone too far to retreat,
and in a few minutes the fawn lay
dead beside its mother.</p>

<p>Sally reproached her husband passionately
when he told her the story
of his wonderful feat.</p>

<p>"If dumb creatures were like men,"
she said, "the wild beasts would get
up a mob to-night, and come here
and lynch us; and not be to blame
either!"</p>

<p>Blanch and I left Mr. Smith meekly
taking his castigation, and went
out to see his victims.</p>

<p>They lay where they had fallen,
on the greensward, poor creatures! a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
sad blot upon the peaceful scene, their
innocent, happy lives quite ebbed
away. We stood by them a little
while in the sunny silence, and it
seemed as though every thing living
shrank from us. We had never before
been out without seeing some
form of that wild animal life with
which the woods were teeming. But
now there was no sound of skittish
steps evading us, no glimpse of shadowy
figures among the trees. All
was silent and dead.</p>

<p>We went to the road-side, and, seating
ourselves on the moss under an
aspen-tree, mourned silently. And
thinking of the slaughtered deer, I
thought of the first death in Eden;
and from that, of the first sin in the
world; and from that, of all the sin
and sorrow that is in the world; and
from that, of Him who came to restore
us to the true Eden, the city of real
peace, and how he stays here unseen,
and watches lest we kill or are killed;
and then I thought, "The nearer one
keeps to the place where he is, the
better."</p>

<p>Blanch half reclined, leaning on her
elbow, and her face looked like a pale
flame in the flickering shadow of the
tree above us. She stretched her hand
and touched tenderly a lovely spray
of partridge-berry that trailed over the
moss, but did not break it. Then she
looked up.</p>

<p>"Minnie," she said, "I'm homesick."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"When will we start?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<h2>THE "ADAM" OF ANDREINI.</h2>


<p>Voltaire, in his life of Milton,
mentioned the fact that in his youth
the poet witnessed at Milan the representation
of a drama entitled,
<cite>Adam; or, Original Sin</cite>, written by
"a certain Gio. Battista Andreini," a
Florentine, and dedicated to Marie
de' Medici, Queen of France. The
French writer stated that Milton must
have taken with him to England a
copy of the work. His account was
repeated by other biographers of the
great English poet, some of whom alluded
to the Italian poem as "a farce."
In consequence of their unfavorable
judgment, the impression has prevailed
that Milton was not indebted
to Andreini for the conception
of his <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, but that the
grandeur and sublimity of the invention
belong solely to him. Andreini's
work fell into oblivion soon
after its production, and has remained
unappreciated even by the author's
countrymen; so that it is not surprising
that the honors due the Catholic
poet have not been rendered by English
or American critics or readers.</p>

<p>The mystery, tragedy, or sacred
drama of <cite>Adam</cite>, composed by Andreini,
was represented at Milan
early in the seventeenth century, and
was received with such enthusiasm
that the author was invited to the
French court by Queen Mary, and
was there loaded with honors. A
splendid edition of his work, dedicated
to the queen, illustrated with plates
and a portrait of the author, was issued
at Milan in 1617. Such a reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
shows the estimation in which
his production was held at the time.
Defects which did not interfere with
the grandeur of the original design impaired
its popularity afterward. The
author was numbered among the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Seicentisti</i>,
and belonged to a school
noted for its departure from simplicity;
for false refinements and extravagant
conceits. Under the influence
of such writers as Marini, Lappi,
Redi, etc., in an age of pedantry,
poetry was removed from nature, and
dragged from her proper sphere. But
though Andreini lived amidst the
prevalence of a corrupt taste, and his
<i>style</i> was in some degree tainted, it
could not have been expected that
any succeeding school, however correct,
should trample under foot the
<i>substance</i> of his work, and slight its
sublimity of conception, to which a
more enlightened age should have
done justice. Such justice, nevertheless,
has been denied him.</p>

<p>After it had been forgotten more
than two hundred years, a tardy acknowledgment
of Andreini's merit
was paid by a few Italian critics, and
a small, unadorned edition of his work
was again published at Lucano; but
in such an unattractive form that it
seems to have awakened little attention.
A few copies of the first edition
were sold as a great literary curiosity.
One, purchased at a large
price, affords us an opportunity of
examining the claim so long buried in
obscurity, and to see how much the
author of <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> has really borrowed.</p>

<p>It is well known that Milton's first
idea, in treating the subject, was to
write a tragedy; and that he had actually
composed some scenes before
he finally resolved to transfer his pencil
to a vaster canvas. The difference
between the epic and dramatic form
gave a great advantage to the English
poet. All the ornaments of description,
in which <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> is
so rich, were denied to Andreini,
since they could not be admitted into
dialogue. That Milton saw and profited
by Andreini's tragedy, can be
proved not only by external testimony,
but by evidence contained in almost
every page of his work. We
must look to the conception and to
the expression of thought, in drawing
the comparison between the two,
which will conclusively show Andreini
to be in truth the precursor of
Milton, the original author of the
design elaborated in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>.
We will give an analysis of the drama,
with extracts faithfully translated, rendering
the literal sense of the original.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The scene of the tragedy is in the
terrestrial paradise. The interlocutors
are the Eternal Father, Michael
and a chorus of angels, Adam and
Eve, Lucifer, the Prince of Hell, Satan,
Beelzebub, the Seven Deadly Sins,
besides various allegorical personages,
such as the World and the Flesh,
Hunger, Fatigue, Despair, Death, and
Vainglory, with a chorus of infernal
messengers and spirits of the elements.
The author's own summary will give
the most accurate idea of the piece.
A chorus of angels in the prologue
sing the glory of the eternal God,
calling upon the new creation to
praise him. The future advent of
the Incarnate Word is dimly predicted.
The Almighty is completing his vast
work by the formation of man; the
new being is welcomed in strains of
jubilee and rejoicing by the shining
choir about him, and the scene proceeds
with solemnity and magnificence,
in language elevated and sublime.
The ecstasy of the newly created
at the glory revealed to his senses
by the celestial train who "cleave heaven
with their wings of gold," and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>devout aspirations of love and homage
toward his Creator, are admirably
expressed. Adam adores the ineffable
mysteries of the Trinity and the
coming Incarnation. The verse
throughout this scene is in lyrical
measures adapted to the subject, and
to the emotions uttered.</p>

<p>Adam falls into sleep, and Eve is
created and named "woman" by the
eternal Father. A resemblance may
be discovered by the curious between
the ascent of the heavenly train from
Eden, after the blessing is pronounced
and the work completed, and a similar
description in the seventh book of
<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. Adam then points
out to Eve the wonders of the new
world, rehearses the divine command
and prohibition, and inspires her with
love for the beneficent Being who
gave them all:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In the second scene, Lucifer rises
from the abyss; and at the first
glance we recognize the conception
which is one of the chief glories of
<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. The apostate of this
piece, like Milton's Satan, is a majestic
being, stem, defying, and dreadless,
even in despair. Pride, indomitable
pride, is still his master passion;
in the midst of his blood-chilling
irony and impiety, we lose not
the awe inspired by a mighty nature,
still mighty and commanding, though
perverted to evil; nor forget that his
"faded splendor wan" is but</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"the excess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of glory obscured."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In a bold and haughty strain, well
befitting the "lost archangel," "vaunting
aloud, though racked with deep
despair," he gives vent to the envy
and hatred of his rebellious spirit:</p>

<p>The partners of his guilt and punishment,
who join him in the garden,
now surround him; and we have a
vivid picture of hell in the midst of
Paradise:</p>

<p>The remainder of the picture, in
its minuteness of horror, partakes too
much of the prevailing want of taste
which disfigured the best productions
of the Italians of the seventeenth
century. We select, of course, some
of the striking passages of the poem,
though we by no means include all
its beauties in our extracts.</p>

<p>Then Satan says:</p>

<span class="i0">More deadly than the sun's intensest ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even when his beams are brightest!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Can we not discover in the above

Milton's lines?</p>

<p>His plan for the destruction of
man is hailed with joy; and Lucifer
next calls up the Seven Deadly Sins to
assist him in his infernal work. To each
of these mysterious impersonations
a different task is assigned, and detailed
at length in the piece. They
are severally commissioned to assail his
intended victims with every variety
of temptation. Pride and Envy are
directed to fill the soul of Eve with
discontented thoughts, and awaken
vain imaginations of superiority; to
suggest regrets that she was not
formed before Adam, as every man
hereafter must receive his being from
woman.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the second act
we have a scene quite different. The
angelic train descends to hymn the
goodness of the Creator and the happiness
of man.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Weave, weave the garlands light<br /></span>

<p>The picture of the first pair, in
their primeval innocence and enjoyment,
full of gratitude to heaven and
love for each other, is so captivating
in its simplicity and beauty that it
would alone be sufficient to redeem
more sins against taste than the whole
book contains. We do not imagine
we are saying too much in calling it
the original of Milton's delineation,
as that of the infernal chief undoubtedly
is. The same graceful and
feminine qualities blend in the exquisite
character of Eve; the same superiority
of intellect, protecting gentleness,
and exalted devotion are seen
in Adam. They are surrounded by
invisible spirits, the emissaries of Lucifer,
who "with jealous leer malign,"
mock at the peaceful purity and happiness
that blasts their envious sight,
and hurl vague threats against the
beings who, while innocent, are safe
from their hostility. Eve weaves for
Adam a garland of flowers, which he
places on his brow as a chain of love.
In reference to this Lurcone says,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Chains of infernal workmanship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall shortly bind you in a subtle fold<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>At the prayers of Adam and Eve,
offered with thanksgiving for their
blessings, the evil spirits precipitately
fly&mdash;the agonies of hell burning in
their hearts. Adam gives names to
the various animals, passing in review
before him.</p>

<p>Scene third is occupied by Lucifer,
in the form of a serpent, Vainglory,
a gigantic figure, magnificently attired,
and his attendant spirits. The
arch-demon exults over his expected
success, the ruin of so smiling a scene:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"<i>Serpent.</i> How lovely smile these flowers,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lo! where my feet have pressed their fragrant tops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So graceful, they have drooped; and at my touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blasting and burning, the moist spirit is fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the scorched petal. How do I rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among these bowers with blighting step to pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To poison with my breath their buds and leaves,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span></p>
<p>Volano acquaints Satan with the
decision of the infernal council, and
Vainglory and the serpent hide themselves
under the tree of knowledge.
Eve enters; the wondrous beauty
of the tempter, gorgeously described,
fascinates her admiring gaze. He is
half-hid in the clustering foliage. Unconscious
of evil, she approaches
nearer, surprised at his aspect; for the
fiend exhibits a form like the fabled
inhabitants of the sea, human to his
breast, the rest of his body enveloped
in scaly folds. Vainglory is invisible,
but is supposed to be secretly
exerting his influence. The serpent,
accosting Eve in the accents of flattery,
enters into conversation with
her, informing her that he was placed
in Eden to take charge of its fruits
and flowers, and gifted with superiority
over the brute creation. He
boasts of his knowledge, which he
vaunts as superior even to hers and
Adam's, notwithstanding that he occupies
a lower rank in the scale of
the creation. He intimates that her
knowledge and Adam's is far from
corresponding to their superior excellence
of form and high capabilities.
Eve inquires how he can regard
Adam's knowledge as trifling. "Doth
he not know," she cries, "the hidden
virtue of each herb and mineral, each
beast and bird, the elements, the
heavens, the stars, the sun?" The
serpent replies:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Ah! how much worthier to know good and evil!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the highest knowledge; this doth hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those mighty secrets dread, sublime, which could<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make you, on earth, like God."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"Doth not this ignorance," he says, "outraging
your liberty with unworthy yoke,
make you inferior even to the savage beasts,
who would not submit to such a law?<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Or
is it that God fears you will equal him in
knowledge? in the essence of divinity? No!

would still be difference," etc.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Serpent then enters upon the
immediate object of his design, employing
his subtle and persuasive eloquence
to overcome Eve's scruples
and induce her to eat of the forbidden
fruit, whose taste is to impart to her
heavenly wisdom. The whole scene
of the temptation is admirably managed.
The advances of the arch deceiver&mdash;now
cautiously sounding her, now
eagerly urging her to disobedience&mdash;the
unsuspecting credulity, the increasing
curiosity of Eve, are drawn
with the pencil of a master.</p>

<p>The Serpent's arguments become
still more specious and pressing:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"Thus I live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeding on this celestial fruit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus to mine eyes all paradise is open&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine eyes, enlightened by the knowledge stored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this most wondrous food."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Serpent speciously insinuates
that man is degraded by being compelled
to seek his food from the same
source with the inferior creation:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Ah! 'tis too true that drawing sustenance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the same source with brutes that throng the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this, at least, renders you like to them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely it is not meet or just that ye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noblest creations of all-forming power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The favored children of the Eternal King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such unworthy state, 'mid rocks and woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should lead a life of vile equality<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With baser animals!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The temptation takes place necessarily
in dialogue. The thoughts are
natural and elevated, and the language
even magnificent. Eve asks the Serpent
what is the cause of his apparent
anxiety that she should eat of the prohibited
fruit; he explains it by informing
her that he will be lord over Eden
when she and her partner, by means
of the mystic food, shall have ascended
to mingle with deities. This is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>new and remarkable trait, of which
Milton has not availed himself.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"But this, my rightful empire o'er the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While man exists and breathes earth's vital air,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Since man alone is chosen, by heaven's command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord of this lower world, this universe<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Here occurs an exquisite touch.
Eve, having never before experienced
a painful moral emotion, is ignorant
of its meaning. The tempter, with
consummate art, interprets her very
fear into encouragement.</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>In evil hour her rash hand plucks
the fruit; and the act closes with the
exulting gratulations of the Deceiver
and Vainglory.</p>

<p>In the succeeding interview with
Adam, in Act iii., the intoxicated Eve
has not begun to taste the consequences

persuade her companion to partake

<p>Death, in the eyes of Adam, is
more welcome than separation from
his beloved; as in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, he
rushes on his fate voluntarily, without
partaking in any of those dreams
of greatness which had beguiled his
frail consort. When the mortal sin
is completed by his participation,
Volano with his trumpet summons
the infernal spirits, who crowd the
scene with shouts of exultation expressed
in lyrical measures. The
Serpent and Vainglory are worshipped
for their success. The evil
spirits vanish before the voice of
the Eternal, who descends with his
angels to pronounce sentence upon
the guilty pair. The solemn account
to which the Judge calls them, their
guilty evasion and detection, and the
stern malediction on the earth cursed
for man's sake, with the punishment
denounced on the human offenders
and on the serpent, are described in
the scriptural language, and with a
simplicity which is in itself sublime.
No <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">concetti</i> are here allowed to mar
the impressive greatness of the scene.
An angel remains after the departure
of the Almighty, and clothes the shivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
pair with the skins of wild
beasts, reminding them that the roughness
of their new raiment signifies the
suffering they are to sustain in the journey
of life. Then the stern Archangel
Michael, the minister of divine vengeance,
appears and commands them
to leave paradise, while the cherubic
host, who had hitherto hovered round
them, forsake their accustomed charge
and reascend to heaven. The flaming
sword of Michael chases the unhappy
fugitives from their lost home,
and his lips confirm their own apprehensions:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"<i>Michael.</i> These stony fields your naked feet shall press,<br /></span>

<p>The chant of the departing angels
mingles with lamentation over the
fall an intimation of peace in the
future.</p>

<p>The poem does not end with the
expulsion from Eden; a second part,
as it were, is contained in the last
two acts, in which the dim promise
of a Redeemer is shadowed forth,
the triumph of hell is turned to rage
and shame, and penitence is comforted
with hope. This completion of the
great plan gives a new grandeur to
the piece, since it is thus made to
embody the most solemn and striking
of all morals.</p>

<p>In Act iv. Volano summons the
spirits of the elements to meet Lucifer,
who calls a council. The
spirits still utter their songs of triumph
over the fall of man; but the
mien of their leader is deject, his
clear-sighted vision already discerns
in the just wrath of God against the
human offenders the latent promise
of mercy. He foresees the pardon
of man, and his restoration through
a Redeemer to the heavenly blessings
from which his destroyer vainly hoped
his transgressions had cut him off.
He is racked with anguish at the
prospect of his work being undone;
but it is no time now to pause; he
must build up still higher the edifice
of his own greatness and his defiance
of Omnipotence. The deep pride of
his character is further illustrated in
the infernal council. He causes to
issue from the earth four monsters hurtful
to man: Mondo, Carne, Morte,
and Demonio&mdash;World, Flesh, Death,
and Devil.</p>

<p>Adam and Eve appear in their fallen
condition, the prey of a thousand
fears and ills, haunted by miseries before
unknown. They bitterly deplore
the changes that have passed on the
creation. The animals manifest terror
at their presence. Four monsters
beset Adam&mdash;the impersonations
of Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and
Despair, that threaten to follow him
unceasingly. Death menaces them
with mortal peril; the heavens grow
dark, thunders roll, and the air is
convulsed with tempest. The scene
closes in gloom and horror.</p>

<p>In the fifth act, Temptation, in alluring
forms, invites the fallen pair
to new crimes. Flesh, in the figure
of a lovely young woman, accosts
Adam, showing him how all things
breathe of love; and Lucifer, in human
shape, persuades him to yield to
her enticements. Here occurs one
of the most exquisitely delicate and
beautiful touches in the poem, and
one that none but a true poet could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
have conceived. The guardian angel
of man yet hovers, unseen, at a
distance; when he sees him thus sore
beset, he comes to his assistance.
The protector is invisible; but his
warning voice, soft as the promptings
of a dream, sounds in the sinner's
ear:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"<i>Angel.</i> 'Tis time to succor man. Alas! what dost thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most wretched Adam?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Lucifer</i>, (<i>to Adam</i>.) Why remain'st thou mute?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why art thou sad?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Adam.</i> I seem a voice to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrowful yet mild, which says, 'Alas! what dost thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most wretched Adam?'"<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="attrib">Act v. sc. 3.
</div></div></div>


<p>Following the promptings of the
angel, which are continued through
the scene, Adam proposes that Lucifer
and his companion shall kneel
with him in prayer. Thus he escapes
the temptation and danger. Lucifer
and his demons refuse to pray, and,
assuming their proper shape, next
assail him by force; but from this
peril he is also guarded.</p>

<p>We then behold Eve wandering
desolate and desponding, affrighted
at all that meets her eyes. Her lamentation
has much simple beauty.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"<i>Eve.</i> Dar'st thou, O wretched Eve!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Once, with unfaltering gaze they could behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beams, and revel in their golden light;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now thy too daring look<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His dazzling rays rebuke;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I dwell in darkness, if my sin has stained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With horrid mists the pure and innocent sun!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O miserable Eve!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If now I turn my feet where fountains gush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To taste the limpid current, I behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crystal wave defiled, or scorching sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Usurp its place. If, famished, I return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pluck the grateful fruit from bending trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its taste is bitter to me; or the worm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blasting touch doth revel on its sweetness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, wearied, I recline among the flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striving to close my eyes, lo! at my side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The serpent rears its crest, or hissing glides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the clustering leaves. If, to escape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint from the noontide heat, I seek the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some thick wood, I tremble at the thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wild beast lurking in the thicket's gloom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And start with dread if but the lightest leaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stir with the wind."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>She also is assailed by a new temptation
personified under the name of
World. This allegorical personage,
arrayed in rich and gorgeous vestments,
crowned with gold and gems,
endeavors to captivate her imagination
by artful flatteries; by visions of
splendor and regal power reserved
for "the queen of the universe."
From a visioned palace comes a troop
of nymphs laden with ornaments,
with which they offer to adorn their
mistress, dancing and singing around
her; but Eve, deaf to World's flatteries,
resists and flies from him;
both she and her consort are too
penitent to listen to evil solicitations,
and at Adam's rebuke the troop disappears
in confusion. Then Lucifer
and his devils, armed for man's destruction,
rush in to seize their victims.
The fierce and final struggle
between the powers of heaven and
hell, for the dominion of earth, takes
place; for the arch-fiend encounters
Michael and his angels, sent to rescue
the frail beings of clay, who, in
terrified astonishment, witness the battle.
It would be doing injustice to
the poem not to give some extracts
from this striking scene.</p>

against the Most High, and
his success in dragging into ruin "the

<p>We have occupied so much space
in the analysis and extracts from this
remarkable work, that little room is
left for further observation. It is impossible
to present all the beauties of
the poem, and allowance must be
made for showing them in another
language; yet some idea may be
afforded of the general character of
the piece. The original abounds
with striking passages that have of
necessity been left unnoticed, strangely
mingled with the tumid extravagances
and heterogeneous conceits
belonging to the age in which it
was written. These faults, however,
are but trifling in comparison with
its merits; and the wonderful conception,
the glorious plan, is not
marred by them. When the superior
personages appear on the scene,
the inspiration of the poet is triumphant
over the defects of his school;
not a line of their language is disfigured
by aught which the most fastidious
of modern tastes could condemn.
It is only in the management
of inferior and of allegorical personages
that the faults alluded to can be
perceived; and even here the rich
and noble genius of the poet has
mastered many of his difficulties.</p>

<p>The author of <cite>Adam</cite> could hardly
have anticipated, in the representation
of his work on the stage, a success
commensurate with its merits; since
the trickery of scenic effect could but
poorly indeed embody the creations
of genius. Fancying an attempt to
make them apparent to the senses
of a rabble audience, we can scarcely
wonder that the whole should have
been stamped with ridicule. But any
reader of the poem will concede that
the sublime conception of <cite>Paradise
Lost</cite> belongs to Andreini as the originator.
He ascended with success
"the highest heaven of invention;"
and when he puts words into the
mouth of Deity, and interprets the
hymnings of angelic choirs, he shows
himself equal to the task.</p>

<p>The extension of the reputation of
this wonderful production would considerably
increase our sense of obligation
to Italian literature.</p>

<h2>FÃNELON.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY THE LATE REV. J. W. CUMMINGS, D.D.</p>


<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: It would
be possible to fix a point of time in
the reign of King Louis XIV. unequalled
in brilliancy by any other in
the eventful history of the French
nation. Such a period would present
to us the great monarch crowned
with the glory of his early successes,
unsullied as yet by the shame of his
later weakness and degradation. A
tableau of the court of Versailles
would show us the throne surrounded
by groups of men illustrious in
every department of human greatness.
To name a few only: military
fame would find its representatives in
CondÃ©, Turenne, Luxembourg, Vauban,
and Villars; poetry, in Malherbe,
La Fontaine, and Boileau; the drama,
in Racine, Corneille, and MoliÃ¨re;
political science, in Mazarin, Colbert,
and Louvois; philosophy, in Pascal
and Descartes; eloquence, in Bourdaloue,
Flechier, Massillon, and Bossuet;
painting, in Poussin and Lesueur;
archaeology, in Mabillon and
Montfaucon; general literature, in
La Rochefoucauld, La BruyÃ¨re, Balzac,
and Madame de SÃ©vignÃ©. Yet
among all the great men of that
wonderful period there is not one,
probably, who, if given a choice,
would not willingly exchange his reputation
with that of FÃ©nelon, who in
early life moved in that brilliant
court as an obscure priest, and in the
fulness of manhood was sent away
from it into honorable exile.</p>

<p>I would it were in my power, ladies
and gentlemen, to lay before you such
a sketch of the life of FÃ©nelon as
would fully explain to you by what
secret a Roman Catholic priest, who
devoted himself so entirely to preaching
and to proselytizing for his church,
became popular to such an unwonted
degree, and remains so to this day,
not less in the Protestant world than
among men of his own creed.</p>

<p>I have neither the time nor, I fear,
the ability to do justice to so excellent
a theme. I do hope, however,
that my brief remarks may have the
effect of so far engaging the curiosity
of the younger portion of my hearers
as to lead them to study FÃ©nelon's
life and writings. Nobody ever rose
from the perusal of either without
feeling an inclination to love himself
less, and to extend a larger and
warmer charity to his fellow-men,
whatever their condition or their
creed.</p>

<p>FranÃ§ois de Salignac de la Mothe,
Marquis of FÃ©nelon, was born in the
chateau of FÃ©nelon in the year 1651,
and came of distinguished lineage on
the side of both parents. His early
education was judicious, his father
and mother training him in morals
and religion both by word and example,
and his able preceptor making it
his aim to teach him the love of study
for its own sake.</p>

<p>The child's brain was not developed
at the expense of the rest of his
body, and abundant daily exercise in
the fresh open air united with regular
and frugal habits to form a sound
body for the dwelling of a noble and
gifted soul.</p>

<p>His decided fondness for Greek
and Latin literature made him a
great reader, yet without effort or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
constraint, and led gradually to the
formation of that mixture of grace
and melody in his style for which he
stands preÃ«minent among the greatest
French writers.</p>

<p>He spent five years in Paris at the
Seminary of St. Sulpice, and took
orders at the age of twenty-four.
His first impulse was to dedicate his
life to the foreign missions; and he
was prevented only by the influence
of his family from coming to America
and settling among the Indians in
Canada.</p>

<p>A mission was provided for him in
the heart of Paris, and there, while
visiting the sick, instructing the ignorant
and the young, comforting and
relieving the poor, and exercising all
the various duties of the Christian
ministry, he acquired that knowledge
of the human heart, and of the mode
of touching and persuading it, that
fitted him, no less than his long and
patient devotion to books, for the
work of improving his fellow-men.
A new field of observation and benevolent
labor was the institution
known as "Les Nouvelles Catholiques,"
a seminary under royal patronage
for the education of young
ladies, chiefly recent converts to the
church. The AbbÃ© FÃ©nelon presided
for ten years over both the ladies in
charge and their pupils, giving both
the benefit of his learning, his refinement,
his gentle and cheerful religious
spirit, and his high-minded and
enlightened devotion. To his knowledge
of the heart of woman, of her
weakness and her strength, gathered
while in this position, we owe his earliest
book, the <cite>Treatise on the Education
of Girls</cite>, a work which made
its author widely known, and procured
for him in time the appointment
of tutor to the grandson of
Louis XIV.</p>

<p>In 1685, the king signed the revocation
of the edict of Nantes. The
effect of this measure was to reduce
his Protestant subjects, amounting to
about two millions, to the cruel alternative
of abjuring their faith or
quitting France for ever. Of the
many that left, some found their way
to the United States, and the descendants
of the Huguenots have
contributed their share to the prosperity
and advancement of the land
of liberty. The king undertook to
bring about the conversion of those
who remained, and, happily for the
Protestants of Saintange and Annis,
the missionary selected for them was
the AbbÃ© de FÃ©nelon. Royal orders
had been given that the missionary
should be supported by a detachment
of dragoons. The proffered assistance
was gently but firmly declined.
"Our ministry," said the abbÃ©, "is
one of harmony and peace. We are
going to our brethren who are astray;
we shall bring them back to the fold
by charity alone. It is not by means
of violence and constraint that conviction
can be made to penetrate the
soul." His reasoning prevailed, and
he was allowed to depart alone. The
stern Calvinists of Poitou soon came
to look upon this new pastor with
kindness and affection, and, in return,
his influence saved them from
further annoyance on the part of the
civil authority.</p>

<p>In 1689, a happy event for the
world of letters occurred in the appointment
of FÃ©nelon to be the tutor
of Louis, Duke of Burgundy, the son
of the dauphin. He applied himself
to his new task with untiring and
conscientious devotion, and the account
of his manner of fulfilling it is
exceedingly interesting. His first
care was to study well the character
and disposition of his pupil. The
result of this investigation was any
thing but encouraging. The Duke
of Saint Simon, who was well acquainted
with the young prince, states that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
he was naturally stubborn, haughty,
and unkind. He was endowed with
strong passions, and fond of every
sort of animal gratification. His
temper was so violent that in his fits
of rage it was dangerous to attempt
to control him. He would tear and
break whatever came to his hands,
and be carried away by such outbursts
of fury that his life seemed to
be really in danger. He was fond
of the pleasures of the table and of
the chase, naturally cruel, and brimful
of a pride that led him to look
upon other men as objects of usefulness
and amusement, rather than as
beings equal to himself.</p>

<p>Such was the pupil confided to the
care of FÃ©nelon; and under his wise
and gentle guidance the headstrong,
selfish, and cruel boy became kind,
generous, modest, and remarkable for
perfect and unfailing self-control.</p>

<p>The besetting sin of the young
prince was a perverseness of temper
always hard to manage and ready, for
the slightest cause, to break out into
open rebellion, on which occasions
no one had been able to control him.
FÃ©nelon's manner of correcting this
fault is full of instruction. He avoided
direct attacks and punishments,
seeking, by gentle remonstrance and
good-natured raillery, to lead the boy
into being ashamed of his fault. When
there was a prospect of being listened
to, he would make use of simple maxims
showing the folly and wickedness
of angry passion, and explaining his
remarks by familiar illustrations likely
to be easily understood and remembered.
Sometimes he yielded without
remonstrance, avoiding all recourse
to authority or personal influence unless
he was well assured that it would
prove successful. The little work
known as <cite>FÃ©nelon's Fables</cite> was composed
piecemeal, each fable being
called forth by some fault the prince
had committed, or for the purpose of
helping him to remember some moral
point, and leading him gradually on
in the system of improvements his
tutor had adopted.</p>

<p>One day, when the prince had made
all around him unhappy by indulging
in repeated bursts of spleen and disobedience,
FÃ©nelon took a sheet of
paper and wrote in his presence the
following sketch, which we find among
the fables:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What great disaster has happened to
Melanthus? Outwardly nothing, inwardly
every thing. He went to bed last night the
delight of all the people; this morning we
are ashamed of him; we shall have to hide
him away. On rising, a fold of his garment
has displeased him, the whole day will therefore
be stormy, and every body will have to
suffer: he makes us fear him, he makes us
pity him, he cries like a child, he roars like
a lion. A poisonous vapor darkens his imagination,
as the ink he uses in writing soils
his fingers. You must not speak to him
about things that pleased him an hour ago;
he loved them then, and for that very reason
he hates them now. The amusements that
interested him a little while ago are now
become intolerable, and must be broken up;
he wishes to contradict and to irritate those
around him, and he is angry because people
will not get angry with him. When he can
find no pretext for attacking others, he turns
against himself; he is low-spirited, and takes
it very ill that any body should try to comfort
him. He wishes for solitude, and he cannot
bear to be left alone; he comes back into company,
and it exasperates him. If his friends
are silent, their affected silence goads him;
if they speak low, he fancies they are talking
about him; if they speak loud, it strikes him
they have too much to say. If they laugh,
it seems to him that they are making game
of him; if they are sad, that their sadness is
meant to reproach him for his faults. What
is to be done? Why, to be as firm and
patient as he is intolerable, and to wait quietly
until he becomes to-morrow as sensible
as he was yesterday. This strange humor
comes and goes in the strangest fashion.
When it seizes him, it is as sudden as the
exploding of a pistol or a gun; he is like
the pictures of those possessed by evil spirits;
his reason becomes unreason; if you
put him to it, you can make him say that it
is dark night at twelve o'clock in the day;
for there is no distinction of day or night
for a man who is out of his head. He sheds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
tears, he laughs, he jokes, he is mad. In
his madness he can be eloquent, amusing,
subtle, full of cunning although he has not a
particle of common sense left. You have
to be extremely careful to pick your words
with him; for although bereft of sense, he
can become suddenly very knowing, and
find his reason for a moment to prove to
you that you have lost yours."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is easy to understand the effect
of a lesson like this on a high-spirited
but self-conceited boy. He sought
to overawe those around him and
finds out that he has made himself
unmistakably ridiculous! The instructor
who wishes to correct his
pupil's faults will succeed oftener by
wounding his vanity than he will by
flattering it.</p>

<p>His fables at another time present
in charming images the happiness of
being good.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Who is," says one of them, "this god-like
shepherd who enters the peaceful shade of
our forest? He loves poetry and listens to
our songs. Poetry will soften his heart,
and render him as gentle as he is proud.
May this young hero grow in virtue as a
flower unfolds in the genial air of spring.
May he love noble thoughts, and may graceful
words ever sit upon his lips. May the
wisdom of Minerva reign in his heart. May
he equal Orpheus in the charms of his voice
and Hercules in the greatness of his achievements.
May he possess all the boldness of
Achilles without his fiery temper. May he
be good, wise, and beneficent, love mankind
tenderly, and be much loved by all in return.
He loves our sweet songs, they reach his
heart even as cooling dews reach the green
sward parched by the heat of mid-summer.
Oh! may the gods teach him moderation
and crown him with endless success. May
he hold in his hand the horn of plenty, and
may the golden age return under his sway.
May wisdom fill his heart and run over into
the hearts of his fellow-men, and may flowers
spring up in his footsteps wherever he may
go."</p></blockquote>

<p>These fables gave a moral and practical
meaning to the details of mythology
which the prince was studying,
and furnished him also with models
of style. They speak to him
and of him as one who is in time to
be a king; but it will be observed that
no traits of character are praised except
those which it was desirable he
should possess.</p>

<p>The main difficulty with the young
prince still recurred&mdash;his impetuous
outbreaks of temper, accompanied
by the stubborn determination to
make every body around him yield
and allow him to have his way, however
unreasonable. This dangerous
condition of mind was always treated
by FÃ©nelon's advice in the same
manner. The Duke de Beauvilliers,
who was his governor; the AbbÃ©
de FÃ©nelon, and his assistant tutor,
the celebrated historian Fleury; even
the officers of his household and
his domestics, all treated him with
proof not of apprehension but of
humiliating compassion. When his
ill-humor grew furiously excited, they
kept aloof and avoided him as one
who had lost the use of his reason
by some sad distemper. If the
fit held out, his books were taken from
him, and instruction was refused him,
as being altogether useless in the deplorable
condition into which he had
now fallen. Left alone, denied all
sympathy, given time to cool down,
made to feel that his rage was undignified
and ineffectual, the boy soon
grew weary, ashamed, and at length
repentant. He would then sue for
pardon, which was only granted after
many promises on his honor that he
would not behave so foolishly and
wickedly again.</p>

<p>One of these promises of amendment,
made in writing, has been preserved
and it reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I promise, on my word of honor as a
prince, to the AbbÃ© de FÃ©nelon to do on the
instant whatever he may tell me, and to
obey immediately when he may forbid me
to do any thing; and if I fail, I hereby submit
myself to every sort of punishment and
dishonor. Done at Versailles, Nov. 29th,
1689, Signed <span class="smcap">Louis</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>This touching engagement upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
honor by a boy under ten years of
age was made in the first year of FÃ©nelon's
charge over him. He had already
begun to make some progress,
in spite of a disposition the ugliness
of which had been previously set down
as incorrigible.</p>

<p>The tutor had determined to master
his pupil's rudeness, as an indispensable
condition of any improvement,
moral or literary.</p>

<p>One day he had recourse to a stratagem
that might present his conduct
to him in a new light. The young
duke stopped one morning to examine
the tools of a carpenter, who had
been summoned to do some work in
his apartment. The man, who had
learned his part from FÃ©nelon, told
him in the roughest manner possible
to go about his business. The prince,
little accustomed to hear such language,
began to resent it; but was interrupted
by the workman, who, raising
his voice and trembling with rage
from head to foot, screamed to him
to get beyond his reach. "I am a
man," cried he, "who, when my temper
is roused, think nothing of breaking
the head of any person that crosses
me." The prince, frightened beyond
measure, ran to his master to tell him
that a crazy man had been allowed to
come into the palace. "He is a poor
laborer," said FÃ©nelon coldly, "whose
only fault is giving signs of violent
anger." "But he is a bad man,"
cried the boy, "and must leave my
apartment." "He is worthy of pity
rather than punishment," added his
tutor. "You are surprised at his
being angry because you disturbed
him at his work; what would you
say now of a prince who beats his
valet at the very time that he is trying
to do him a service?"</p>

<p>On another occasion the young
man, piqued by the tone of severity
which his tutor had found it necessary
to assume, answered him in the
most arrogant manner, "I will not
allow you, sir, to command me; I
know what I am, and I know what you
are." FÃ©nelon answered not a word;
for remonstrance or reproof would
have been useless. He determined,
however, to give his pupil a lesson he
should not easily forget. For the rest
of that day he did not speak to him,
his sadness alone evincing his displeasure.
On the following morning
he entered the duke's chamber immediately
after his being awakened.
"I do not know, sir," said he to his
pupil with cold and distant respect,
"if you recollect what you told me
yesterday, namely, that you knew
who you are and who I am. It is
my duty to make you understand that
you know neither one nor the other.
You fancy then, sir, that you are more
than I. Some lackey may have told
you so; but I hesitate not, as you force
me to it, to tell you that I am far
above you. There is no question
here of birth, which adds nothing to
your personal merit. You cannot
pretend to surpass me in wisdom.
You know nothing but what I have
taught you, and that is nothing compared
with what remains for you to
learn. As to power, you have none
whatever over me; but I have authority
full and entire over you. The
king and monseigneur the dauphin
have told you so often enough. You
may think that I consider it a great
thing to hold the situation I fill near
your person. Let me tell you that
you are altogether mistaken. I have
accepted it only to obey the king and
to please monseigneur, not certainly
for the painful advantage of being your
preceptor. To convince you of all I
have said, I am about to lead you to his
majesty, and to beg him to give you
some other tutor, who will meet, I
hope, with more consoling success
than I have."</p>

<p>This speech threw the prince into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
the greatest consternation. "O my
master!" he exclaimed, bursting into
tears, "if you abandon me, what will
become of me? Do not make the
king my enemy for life. Forgive me
for what I said yesterday, and I promise
you never, never, to displease
you again."</p>

<p>FÃ©nelon did not yield easily, although
on the following day he consented
to be reconciled to his pupil.</p>

<p>His main dependence, however, in
forming the character of the boy, was
the sound religious principles which
he never grew tired of instilling into
his mind by word and example. He
would at any moment interrupt literary
instruction to explain some point
of duty upon which his pupil might
desire to converse. He taught him
to look up to God, not with servile
fear, but to love him; and to love to
think and speak of him as the author
of all that is beautiful in nature and in
man. FÃ©nelon gives us himself an instance
of the empire of religion over
his soul in a beautiful sketch which
he wrote after his pupil's death. "One
day," he says, "when he was in a very
bad humor, and when he was seeking
to conceal some act of disobedience,
I asked him to tell me before God
what he had done. 'Before God!'
he exclaimed with great anger; 'why
do you ask me "before God"? But
since you do so ask me, I cannot deceive
you; I therefore acknowledge
my guilt.' He spoke thus, although
he was at the moment frantic with
rage. But religion had over him so
much power that it forced from him
the painful avowal."</p>

<p>It is difficult to record without emotion
what FÃ©nelon says further on of
this noble youth, whom he came to
love with paternal tenderness, and
whose untimely death filled his heart
with sorrow. "He would often tell
me in our unrestrained conversations,
'I leave the Duke of Burgundy outside
the door when I am with you,
and I am nothing but little Louis.'"
He closes the sketch by this splendid
tribute to the change which had been
wrought in his pupil's whole character:
"I have never known a person
whom it was more easy to tell of his
own faults, or who would listen more
readily to unpalatable truth." In proof
of the excellent literary and scientific
training of the prince, we find that
the great Bossuet, after examining
him for several hours, expressed himself
satisfied and surprised at the young
man's proficiency; and thus bore testimony
to the ability and success of
his tutor. Two works besides the
<cite>Fables</cite> deserve to be mentioned as
fruits of this course of education.
One, <cite>FÃ©nelon's Dialogues</cite>, in which he
presents to his royal pupil the different
personages of history, speaking
their true sentiments, and making
known the secret motives of their actions.
The other is the far-famed
prose-poem, <cite>The Adventures of Telemachus,
Son of Ulysses</cite>, which has won
for its author the glory of having produced
the most perfectly-written book
in the French language.</p>

<p>Little more remains to be said of
the Duke of Burgundy. FÃ©nelon
labored long and faithfully to make
him fit to ascend the throne of France;
he lived to see this work, involving
such immense future good or evil,
completed, and completed to his entire
satisfaction. By an early death
the dear young prince, in whom such
vast expectations were centred, was
lost to the love of his master and of
France. Had he lived to reign in
place of the weak and dissolute Count
d'Artois, afterward Louis XV., the
page of history setting forth in letters
of fire and blood the scenes of the destruction
of the French monarchy,
might perhaps have remained unwritten.</p>

<p>FÃ©nelon had not been made bishop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
when he became acquainted with Madame
de Guyon. He approved of
the writings of this gifted woman as
sound in the light of Catholic theology.
He defended her character as
free from the slightest ground of reproach,
and avowed the opinion that
she was guided by a spirit of goodness
and truth. She was looked upon by
her adversaries at the court as visionary
in her piety, heretical in doctrine,
and far from irreproachable in her
conduct. FÃ©nelon, now become Archbishop
of Cambrai, was forced into a
controversy in reference to her affairs,
one side of which he conducted alone,
while on the other there were ranged
against him the great Bossuet, the
French court, the king, the court of
Rome, and, finally, the supreme pontiff
himself.</p>

<p>The modern student of history is
surprised to discover the loose courtiers
of Louis XIV., both men and
women, hotly engaged in a controversy
on an abstract point of ascetic
theology; to see the ungrateful king
banishing from his presence the saviour
of his grandson, and the most
honest man in his court; to see Bossuet
allowing his powerful mind to be
used as a weapon for the persecution
of FÃ©nelon; to see FÃ©nelon, in a position
of so great difficulty and delicacy,
always consistent, always conscientious,
always refined, always eloquent,
always pious, and yet speaking
out boldly and bravely, without regard
to consequences, what seemed to him
to be right and true.</p>

<p>The controversy, in course of time,
was narrowed down to the question
whether the doctrine taught in a book
of FÃ©nelon's, entitled the <cite>Maxims of
the Saints</cite>, was or was not the doctrine
of the Roman Catholic Church.
After a long investigation, the pope,
as final judge in the matter, condemned
the book, while extolling the personal
virtues of the author. Without
the slightest hesitancy, FÃ©nelon bowed
to the decision of the tribunal of
final appeal, and condemned the book
himself from the pulpit of his own cathedral.
There was no mistaking his
motive. He had shown clearly that
he was beyond the influence of hope
and fear, and that he humbled himself
only because he truly believed
now that he had been faulty, at least
in expression. So noble an act of
self-denial, humility, and obedience
was attributed on all sides to its true
source, namely, his sense of duty, and
nothing else. Honest and upright
dealing, according to the dictates of
his conscience, proved the very best
policy he could have followed in self-protection;
for good and bad alike
admired and applauded him all over
the world. The book, abandoned by
its author, ceased henceforth to be an
object of interest, and FÃ©nelon was
the only one who gained any credit
from a controversy in which good
men and bad men had been strangely
mixed up together, and fair means
and foul were used in a fruitless endeavor
to crush him.</p>

<p>The last years of FÃ©nelon were
passed in Cambrai, of which he was
both archbishop and duke, and in
which he was admired and beloved
by all, whether rich or poor. Faithful
in the discharge of every pastoral
duty, he divided his time among the
poor, the sick, the imprisoned, the
young, and the ignorant, helping, relieving,
instructing, consoling all. The
rest of the day he spent among his
books, or in the company of intellectual
and virtuous friends. The poorest
villagers feared not to approach
and speak to one whose simplicity
and gentleness they well understood,
and to whose goodness of heart no
one ever appealed in vain.</p>

<p>His peaceful diocese soon became
the theatre of scenes of bloodshed
and desolation, caused by that war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
of succession during which the star
of Louis XIV. began finally to pale
before the rising glories of the Duke
of Marlborough. FÃ©nelon gave up
his property and his palace itself for
the relief and accommodation of the
sick and the wounded. He distributed
among the poor the grain and the
fruits over which he had control, and
ordered his steward to give food and
lodging to all who needed it. When
he was told that such liberality would
absolutely ruin him, "God will help
us," he replied; "his resources are infinite.
Meanwhile let us give as long
as we have any thing to give, and
we shall have done our duty." His
episcopal mansion was occupied by
officers and soldiers as a hospital, his
barns and outhouses were used as
asylums by the peasantry who had
fled before the troops of the allied
army, and his courts and gardens
were filled with the cattle the poor
country people had driven in, protected
by the influence of FÃ©nelon's
name.</p>

<p>So powerful was that name that
the invading commanders spared all
property belonging to the archbishop,
and Marlborough even ordered a
quantity of grain which had been
taken at Chateau Cambresis, and which
he had been informed was the property
of the archbishop, to be placed
on wagons and driven into the public
square of Cambrai under an escort
of British troops.</p>

<p>But in his fatherly kindness and attention
to the wants of those around
him, FÃ©nelon did not cease to take a
lively interest in the fortunes of the
whole country. He could not witness
the threatened downfall of his
beloved France without the deepest
feelings of sorrow. The danger of
the nation was extreme. Louis was
engaged in a ruinous war with a powerful
and conquering enemy. He
could not retire from the contest with
honor, and he had neither funds nor
credit to carry it on with success. In
this desperate strait, the king declared
that he would die at the head of his
nobles, a brave resolution that could
not, however, save the country. In
this trying emergency the genius of
FÃ©nelon saw a solution better than
that proposed by the king. It was
bodied forth in a letter to the Duke
de Chevreuse, and is probably the
most striking production that ever
came from his pen. He tells the duke
that the nobles cannot save the king,
that the danger is extreme, and that
his true friends must advise him to
turn for countenance and relief to the
people. The nation is in a critical
position. Let the nation be consulted.
Let not France be taxed without
her consent to carry on a war in
which she feels no interest. The people
have been badly governed. Let
them be called upon to take part in
their own government for the future.
"There is danger," he grants, "in
passing suddenly from unqualified
dependence to an excess of liberty.
Great caution will be necessary; but
it is nevertheless certain that arbitrary
authority will not save the country
from ruin." "Despotism," he
adds, "with plenty of means, is a government
of prompt action; but when
despotism becomes bankrupt, the first
who abandon it to ruin are the venal
men whom it has allowed to fatten
on the blood of the people." The
priest from whom these remarks are
quoted is not Lamennais or Gioberti,
but an archbishop of the time of
Louis XIV. The whole letter reads
like a prophecy, or like a history of
what took place less than a century
later. If FÃ©nelon's advice had been
acted upon, how gloriously would
France have entered the first of nations
upon the march of improvement.
Religion and order would not have
been made to seem enemies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
people, and the names of Diderot
and the EncyclopÃ¦dia, of Robespierre
and the Directory, might have
remained unknown for ever!</p>

<p>We need not delay here further
than to say that, while FÃ©nelon looked
into the heart of the people for
the source of national strength, a
succession of rapid events saved the
king from the terrible alternative in
which he was placed. The Emperor
Joseph I. died, Marlborough fell into
disfavor at home, Marshal Villars
gained the victory of Denain, and
the whole face of Europe was changed.
A treaty of peace was signed at
Utrecht in 1713.</p>

<p>Several of FÃ©nelon's friends died
in rapid succession, and his loving
spirit was penetrated with grief at
their loss. His death was hastened
beyond doubt by the poignancy of
his regret at these repeated afflictions.
Why delay the sequel? His work
was done, his views of life, his principles
of duty to God, to one's country
and to one's self, had been faithfully
chronicled by his pen, and taught
by the example of his serene and patient
virtue. His hour was come,
and in loving peace with all mankind,
with words of faith on his lips, and
the bright smile of Christian hope on
his countenance, he breathed forth his
pure spirit into the hands of his Maker.
After his death, no funds were
discovered belonging to him. They
had been all distributed among the
poor. He was buried without pomp
in his church of Cambrai. During
the Reign of Terror, the ancient tombs
of that church were rifled, the leaden
coffins were sent to the arsenal to be
melted into bullets, and their contents
thrown into the common burial
ground. But when the invaders came
to the bier of FÃ©nelon, it was borne
with decency and veneration into the
city, and placed in a monument erected
to his memory at a time when the
sepulchres of emperors and kings
were ruthlessly dismantled, and their
ashes scattered pitilessly to the four
winds of heaven.</p>

<p>Other great men of the age of FÃ©nelon
still live in history; few are admired
more than he, and none is so
much loved by men who upon other
points are far from agreeing together.
The wish expressed by one of his distinguished
countrymen, that his memory
might have the same advantage
as his life, namely, that of making
men love religion, has been fulfilled.</p>

<p>He wrote learnedly and eloquently
in defence of his faith, and in refutation
of the views of his opponents;
and yet he avoids in all his works the
extremes both of flattery and of harshness.
Men of all religions recognize
in him a friend, for all were embraced
in his world-wide Christian charity;
and yet they must bear with us, his
fellow-Catholics, when we claim for
our church the special honor of having
made him the great and good
man which all acknowledge him to
have been. The earliest lessons he
received came from the lips of devoted
Catholic parents; and when his
will was opened after his death, the
first words read were the following
emphatic expressions: "I declare
that I wish to die in the arms of
the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman
Church, my mother. God, who reads
the heart, and will be my judge,
knows that there has not been an
instant of my life in which I have not
cherished for her the submission and
docility of a little child." A noble
tribute this, and one which leads us
to look not despondingly to the tree
which is capable of producing such
sound and genial fruit.</p>

<p>This transient reflection, ladies and
gentlemen, presents itself naturally to
the mind, and nothing is further from
my thoughts than an attempt to
enlist your hearts against your cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
judgment in favor of the Roman
Catholic Church. The claim which
that church puts forth to your attention
is based officially by her on her
divine right to the reverence of mankind.
She has never refused to give
man the history of her origin, and to
submit to his earnest scrutiny the
proofs of her divine commission. She
claims to be the only institution established
on this earth to teach man
what is necessary that he may be saved,
and asks and accepts no stinted
or divided allegiance. She alleges
distinctly that human reason is unable
without assistance to find and embrace
the true, and that the human
will is unable without assistance to
find and embrace the good. She undertakes
to impart the highest truth
and the highest good to all who take
her for their guide and their mother.
She has been more cordially hated,
and more devotedly beloved, than any
object that history in all its witnessing
can tell of. She claims not only
to be a teacher, but a teacher endowed
with unerring authority, and offers
as vouchers for that claim the clear
promise of her divine Founder, to
abide with her until the end of time,
and the lives and deaths of innumerable
men and women taught by her
to live perfectly upon earth. She has
never disguised the greatness of that
sacrifice of self which must be made by
every man who would enjoy the peace
here and the immortality of happiness
hereafter, which she pledges to her
faithful children; but she promises, in
the name of God, supernatural assistance
for making that sacrifice in spite
of its seeming terrors. She uses no efforts
to gain popularity; her system
moves slowly, and rarely in such form
as to take advantage of the interests
or aspirations of the day. She never
aims to be found on the side of human
passions. She hesitates not to
condemn those who differ with her
authorized teachings, and she intimates
to every man who sets up an
altar against her altar that he does God
and his fellow-mortals no good service,
either temporal or eternal.</p>

<p>Whatever religious symbolism has
been offered in the world hitherto as
a substitute for her apostolic creed,
has been founded on the principle
that man is fit to take into his own
hands the management of the affairs
of his own soul; but the Catholic
Church tells man that his private
judgment is sure to mislead him in
matters of religion, in spite of lofty
aspirations and purity of intention;
that he is bound not only to render
obedience to his God, but in the
manner God requires it; and nevertheless
that religious direction need
not be arbitrary; that it no more violates
the freedom of man's will than
the strong hand of a parent violates
the freedom of the little child whom
it leads lovingly onward and prevents
from falling weakly to the ground.</p>

<p>No system which presents to man effort
and self-restraint in the present, and
advantage and freedom in the future
only, can flatter his love of ease and selfish
enjoyment. He is thus, at intervals
at least, impatient of order, though it is
heaven's first law; of legislation, though
it has for its object the greatest good
of the greatest number; of society,
though its proper aim is to make each
a friend and a helper to all, and all
friends and helpers to each; and of
science, that teaches him the laws
of nature and the sad effects of their
violation. By the same spirit is man
urged to resent and cast off the restraints
imposed upon him by religion
and the church. But in this case, and
in the others the opposition comes
not from reason; it is the uprising of
selfish interest or passion, assuming to
speak out for the whole man, and for
all time.</p>

<p>Again, that which is spoken against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
as the church is not the church; that
which is spoken against as the belief,
or practice, or requirement of the
church, is hers perhaps in appearance,
but in very truth it is not what she
upholds, but what she reproves and
opposes. There is a weird presentment
bodied forth in English literature
and called popery. It is certainly
a figure of no amiable or attractive
lineaments; it is worthy of the
hatred of honest men. But it is not
the Catholic Church. If the Catholic
Church were the same thing as
this ghost which goes by the name of
popery, we should hate it too; for it
deserves to be hated, and we are men
possessing the same faculties as our
neighbors who hate it. We do not
hate the Catholic Church; we love
her, and honor her as our mother,
and so would our neighbors, if they
saw her and knew her as we do.</p>

<p>Let us here understand the thing
plainly. I uphold the doctrine and
the practice of the Catholic Church;
for I believe her to be the true church
that the Son of God established on
this earth, and ransomed at the price
of his precious blood. But I can say
for myself and for every Catholic who
has been properly instructed in his
religion, that we do not undertake to
defend what has been done weakly
or wickedly by men, even though
they too called themselves Catholics.</p>

<p>I believe that light travels from east
to west, and the faith which Judea
gave to Rome, and Rome to Europe,
and Europe to us, is the faith by
which we are to be saved, if saved at
all. But while thanking Europe for
the true religion, I pray to my God
that all the ancient feuds and heart-burnings
which have distracted older
countries in the name of religion may
not be transplanted to this virgin soil.</p>

<p>Allow me to close my remarks, ladies
and gentleman, with the heart-felt
wish that we may all live faithful to
our honest convictions, preach our
religion by word and example, and
force upon each other nothing but
the endearing offices of fraternal charity.</p>

<h2>DION AND THE SIBYLS.<br />

<small>A CLASSIC, CHRISTIAN NOVEL.</small></h2>

<p class="center">BY MILES GERALD KEON, COLONIAL SECRETARY, BERMUDA, AUTHOR OF
"HARDING THE MONEY-SPINNER," ETC.</p>


<h3>PART II.<br />

CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>The die was cast, and Paulus went
away plighted to an undertaking
which appeared sufficiently arduous,
and some of the chances of which
were even full of horror.</p>

<p>The news of the arrangement
spread through the palace of the Mamurras
before he had well quitted
FormiÃ¦. From the palace it circulated
through the town, from the town
it reached the camp the same evening;
and next day the surrounding
country knew it. Carrier-pigeons<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
had borne to Rome a hint of the gayeties,
the interest, and the splendor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>which the simultaneous occurrence of
the emperor's visit, and the collection
of an army for real fighting purposes,
(in fact, to repel the German invasion,)
were likely to call forth in the old
Latian town; and now the same
aerial messengers apprised many a
sated circus-goer in the capital that
a very pretty novelty indeed would
be added to the contests of gladiators
and the battles of wild beasts.</p>

<p>The concourse pouring into and
converging from all parts toward FormiÃ¦,
which had already been so extensive,
increased, therefore, into an
enormous concentric movement. Nothing
can better show what a prodigious
multitude was thus accidentally
collected than the fact that, even at
Rome, (which then contained four
millions of inhabitants,) a diminution
of pressure was perceptible, for the
time, to those who remained. This
change resembled what Londoners
experience on the Derby day.</p>

<p>Paulus, that evening, having passed
a considerable time with his mother
and sister, (to whom he communicated
the fact of his engagement without
alarming them by explaining its
peculiar horrors,) felt little inclined to
sleep. When, therefore, the lanista
Thellus, who had, as Claudius said he
would invite him to do, brought back
Benigna to Crispus's inn, was taking
his leave of the Lady Aglais and of
Agatha, Paulus said to him,</p>

<p>"Do not go soon; but come down
into the garden and let us take a
stroll. We may not often be able to
converse with each other hereafter."</p>

<p>"Gladly, my valiant youth," said
Thellus; and they descended together.</p>

<p>A beautiful starry and moonlit
night looked down over Italy, as
they sauntered in the fragrant garden,
conversing a little and then relapsing
into thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>Presently Thellus said,</p>

<p>"This adventure of yours makes
me unhappy."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Paulus, "my mother
and sister have such need of my
protection that I feel no levity about
it myself. I confess that it is a grave
business."</p>

<p>They now walked up and down
the laurel alley a few turns, absorbed
in thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly two men approached them
along two different gravel-walks in
the garden, one dressed as a slave,
the other in the uniform of a decurion,
a legionary officer, slightly more important
than a modern sergeant of
the line in the English army.</p>

<p>The slave had one of the worst
countenances, and the decurion one of
the most honest, that Paulus in his
very limited or Thellus in his immense
experience had ever beheld. Paulus
recognized the slave at once; it was
that Lygdus who had endeavored to
bring him to the ground by a side-sweep
of Cneius Piso's sword, which this
man, as the reader will remember,
was carrying at the time.</p>

<p>The decurion gave Paulus a letter,
directed in the same handwriting,
folded in the same style, and its silk
thread sealed with the same device
of a frog, as a certain communication
which he had once before received.</p>

<p>The moon shone high, and so
calm was the night that it proved
easy to read the bold characters.</p>

<p>They ran thus:</p>

<p>"Velleius Paterculus, military tribune,
salutes Paulus Lepidus Ãmilius.
Renounce this absurd engagement,
which cannot concern you.
It is yet possible, but will be too late
to-morrow, to plead ignorance of what
you were undertaking. Leave wretched
slaves to their fate!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vale.</span>"</p>

<p>Paulus, after reading this note, begged
the decurion to wait, and, turning
to Lygdus, asked his business.</p>

<p>The slave stated his name, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
said he was appointed to receive,
dating from the day after the next,
the provender which he understood
Paulus to be desirous of furnishing
for the use of the Sejan horse.</p>

<p>"Has Tiberius CÃ¦sar appointed
you."</p>

<p>"Sir, yes."</p>

<p>"Of course, then, you are used to
horses?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I have always belonged to
the stable," said Lygdus.</p>

<p>"But," pursued Paulus, "am I then
forbidden to enter the stable myself,
and make acquaintance with the
horse I have to break?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I have orders," answered this
Lygdus&mdash;who, as I think I have already
mentioned, was destined, as
the instrument of Cneius Piso and
Plancina, some few years later, to be
the cruel assassin of Germanicus&mdash;"I
have orders always to admit you, and
always to watch you."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> to watch a Roman knight!"</p>

<p>"For that matter, most honored
sir," answered Lygdus, "the rank of
the person watched does not alter
the eyes of the watcher. I could
watch a Roman senator, or even a
Roman CÃ¦sar, if necessary."</p>

<p>"I will be security you could,"
said Thellus, whose great and almost
diaphanous nostrils quivered as he
spoke.</p>

<p>Lygdus, by way of answer, withdrew
a pace.</p>

<p>The decurion, meanwhile, had taken
off his helmet, and the starry heavens
were not more clear than his
indignant, simple countenance.</p>

<p>"It is well," said Paulus. "I will
ask for you at FormiÃ¦. Go now."</p>

<p>Lygdus therefore went away.</p>

<p>"Decurion," said Paulus, "say to
the esteemed Velleius Paterculus that
I am very grateful to him; but what
must be, must be."</p>

<p>"And what is <em>that</em>, noble sir?" answered
the decurion, "in case my
commanding officer should ask me
for an explanation?"</p>

<p>"That I have given my word advertently,
and will keep it faithfully,"
replied Paulus.</p>

<p>"Is this, noble sir," said the decurion,
"what you mean by <i>that which
must be</i>?"</p>

<p>"Have I, then," answered Paulus,
"said any thing obscure or confused?"</p>

<p>"Only something unusual, excellent
sir," said the decurion; "but not
any thing confused or obscure. Permit
me to add, that the whole camp
knows the circumstances of this miserable
undertaking, and wishes you
well; and I feel in my single bosom
the good wishes of the whole camp
for your success."</p>

<p>"What is your name, brave decurion?"</p>

<p>"Longinus."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Paulus, "if I survive
the struggle with this creature,
I mean to join the expedition of
Germanicus CÃ¦sar, and I will have
my eye upon you. I should like to
be your informant that you were promoted
to a higher rank, and to call
you the <i>Centurion Longinus</i>."</p>

<p>Tears were standing in the Roman
decurion's eyes as he bowed to take
leave.</p>

<p>Thellus and Paulus, being now left
again alone, resumed their walk up
and down the laurel alley.</p>

<p>"I am not so conversant with
horses," observed Thellus, "as I
could for your sake at present wish to
be. But all animals, I notice, are
more quiet <i>when blinded</i>."</p>

<p>At this moment the branches of a
cross-walk rustled, and a stately figure
in the Greek <i>lÃ¦na</i> (<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ÏÎ»Î±á¿Î½Î±</span>) approached
them.</p>

<p>"Are you not Ãmilius, the nephew
of the triumvir?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Paulus.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" continued the new-comer,
looking at Thellus. "I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
something to say which may concern
your safety."</p>

<p>"You may trust this brave man,"
said Paulus; "it is my friend Thellus."</p>

<p>"Well," pursued the other, in a very
low tone, "take this little pot of ointment;
and two hours before you have
to ride the Sejan horse, go into his
stable, make friends with him, and
rub his nostrils with the contents. He
will be then muzzled, you know. You
will find him afterward docile."</p>

<p>"Whom have I to thank for so
much interest in me?" demanded
Paulus.</p>

<p>"My name is Charicles," replied
the stranger hesitatingly, and still
speaking almost in a whisper; "and
I have the honor of numbering Dionysius
of Athens among the best of
my friends."</p>

<p>"My mother," returned Paulus,
"would, I think, be glad to see you
some day soon."</p>

<p>"I shall feel it an honor; but pray
excuse me to her to-night," said Charicles.
"Tiberius CÃ¦sar knows nothing
of my absence, and I had better
return at once to FormiÃ¦. I will
visit you again."</p>

<p>"But would this ointment injure
the horse?" inquired Paulus.</p>

<p>"Not by any means," said Charicles;
"it comes from a distant eastern
land. It will merely make him
sleepy. I have been more than an hour
and a half handling the ingredients,
and I can hardly keep awake myself.
Forgive my hurry&mdash;farewell." And
the stately Greek made an obeisance
as he disappeared.</p>

<p>Paulus remained, holding the pot,
which consisted of some kind of porcelain,
in his hand, and looking at it,
when Thellus exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Why, this laurel hedge is alive!"</p>

<p>In a moment he had sprung through
it and returned, dragging in his mighty
grasp Lygdus the slave.</p>

<p>"Not yet departed?" said Thellus.</p>

<p>"Sir, I was asleep," replied the
slave, with a look of terror.</p>

<p>"I have but to tighten my fingers,"
cried Thellus, "and you will sleep so
as not to awake in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Thellus," observed Paulus, "I am
not depending either on this man's
knowledge or on this man's ignorance.
I have quite other hopes and other
grounds of confidence. Let him go."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Thellus, "I would like
to have the chastising of you. But go,
as this noble gentleman desires; go,
then, as the young Roman knight
bids you!"</p>

<p>He shook the reptile-headed, down-looking,
and side-looking slave away,
and the latter disappeared.</p>

<p>"O friend and noble sir!" said
Thellus, "it nearly breaks my heart
to see you thus bound hand and foot,
and doomed to destruction."</p>

<p>"Have a good heart, dear Thellus,"
said Paulus.</p>

<p>So they parted, the gladiator returning
to his vehicle, and Paulus retiring
to his room, where, as he lay on his
bed and listened to the plash of the
fountain in the impluvium, he silently
and calmly offered back to the great
unknown God whom Dionysius worshipped
the life which he, that unknown
Deity, could alone have given.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>Next morning, before the family
were out of their beds, Phylis the slave
had returned from Monte Circello
with the following note:</p>

<p>"Marcus Lepidus Ãmilius hails
the widow of his brave and valiant
brother. Come with your children.
The last of mine has, alas! died under
the clemency of one man, and the
liberality of another. The clement
man is Augustus, the liberal man was
MÃ¦cenas. All that I now retain is
yours; and yours shall be all I may
be able to leave. Farewell."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span></p>

<p>But despite of this note, Paulus
could not persuade his mother to depart
from that neighborhood till after
the trifling display of horsemanship,
as he called it, which he had to afford
for the amusement of the Roman world
on the evening of the third day ensuing.
A little ruffled at his failure
to persuade the Lady Aglais to go
away, he summoned their freedman
Philip, and with him for a companion
started on foot for FormiÃ¦ before
noon, along a road as thronged at
that moment and as animated as the
road to Epsom is the eve of what
Lord Palmerston has rather affectedly,
and, as applied to an annual event,
very incorrectly, called the Isthmian
games of England.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he and Philip entered
the southern gate, when they noticed
a little crowd around some nurses,
one of whom, apparently a Nubian,
held the hand of a magnificently-attired
child of any age between five
and eight. At his side was an eastern-looking
youth of about eighteen, whom
the reader has met before. Thellus
the gladiator was standing with folded
arms on the outskirts of the suddenly-collected
concourse. The child had
dropped some toy, which a dog had
seized in his mouth, and had thereby
defaced. The dog was now a prisoner,
held fast by the throat in a slave's
hands.</p>

<p>"The poor dog knew not what he
was doing," said the nurse.</p>

<p>"I care nothing for that," cried the
child, who was purple with passion.
"Strangle him, Lygdus."</p>

<p>And accordingly Lygdus tightened
his grasp of the dog's throat till the
animal's tongue was thrust forth; the
grasp was yet longer maintained, and
the dog was throttled dead.</p>

<p>"Is it dead?" screamed the child.</p>

<p>"Quite; see," replied Lygdus, casting
away upon the street the breathless
carcass.</p>

<p>"Ah! beautiful!" cried the child;
"now come away."</p>

<p>"Nice and neat as an execution,"
said a powerfully-built, dusky, middle-aged
man, having a long, ruddy beard,
streaked with gray, around whom
were several slaves in Asiatic dress.
This person also the reader has met
before. "But," added he, "I am
going up for my own trial, and I hope
it will not be followed by another execution."</p>

<p>"I only hope it <em>will</em>" cried the
interesting child. "What fun it would
be to see a man strangled."</p>

<p>"Who is that infant monster, Thellus?"
asked Paulus.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>"He is the son of Germanicus and
Agrippina; his name is Caius. You
see, young as he is, he already wears
the <i>caligÃ¦</i> of the common soldiers,
among whom he continually lives.
It is his delight. They nickname
him Caligula. Do you know, there
are good chances he yet wears the
purple, and succeeds Augustus, or at
least Augustus's next heir, as emperor
of the world."</p>

<p>"Happy world will it be under his
rule," said Paulus.</p>

<p>Suddenly there were cries of "Make
way." Lictors moved, making large
room among the crowd. Sejanus appeared
in the robes of a prÃ¦tor; and
Paulus and his friend Thellus found
themselves borne along, like leaves in
a stream, toward the back of the
Mamurran palace, in a large room on
the ground floor of which they presently
beheld the big, dusky-colored
man of fifty or thereabouts, with the
long, ruddy, gray-streaked beard,
standing before a sort of bar. Behind
the bar, on a chair of state, like the
curule chair of the senators, Augustus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>was sitting. A crowd of famous persons,
many of whom we have already
had occasion to mention, stood behind
him, and on either hand Livy,
Lucius Varius, Haterius, Domitius
Afer, Antistius Labio, Germanicus,
and Tiberius CÃ¦sar were there. In
a row behind were Cneius Piso,
Pontius Pilate, and the boy Herod
Agrippa.</p>

<p>"And so," said Augustus, "you
tell us you are the son of Herod the
Great, as he is called; in other words,
Herod the IdumÃ¦an; his son Alexander?"</p>

<p>"We have seen," said Paulus to
Thellus, in a whisper, "the fate of a
dog; we are now to learn that of a
king, or a pretender to the dignity."</p>

<p>"Great and dread commander,
such I am," answered the red-bearded,
big, dark man.</p>

<p>"But," said Augustus, "the accredited
rumor runs that Herod condemned
his two sons, Aristobulus and Alexander,
to death. Nay, I have the
official report sent to me at the time by
the prefect of Syria, and letters from
Herod the IdumÃ¦an himself."</p>

<p>"Herod condemned them, but the
executioner killed others instead," answered
the Jew. "<em>They</em> escaped to
Sidon."</p>

<p>"<i>Them and they!</i>" said Augustus;
"you mean that others were executed
instead of <em>them</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my commander."</p>

<p>"Why do you not," pursued Augustus,
"say <span class="smcap">INSTEAD OF US</span>?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand," replied the
Jew.</p>

<p>"Are you not," asked Augustus,
"one of them?"</p>

<p>"I am the son of Herod."</p>

<p>"You speak as though you had
gone out of that person. You speak
rather like a historian than like a sufferer
and an actor. You are talking
of yourself and your brother, yet you
say <span class="smcap">THEY</span>, not WE!"</p>

<p>"Such is the style of the east, emperor."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Augustus; "I
know the style of the east perfectly
well. Solve me now another difficulty:
I also well know Herod the
IdumÃ¦an, many cases connected with
whom were litigated before me, and
decided by me. Now, I never knew
a man who, having determined that
any body was to die, took such methodical
pains to carry that determination
into effect. He dealt largely
in executions; and if there was
a person in the world, it was Herod,
who saw with his own eyes that his
intended executions should be realities."</p>

<p>"Mine was not," said the Jew, and
a laugh arose in court. "All the Jews
in Sidon know that I am Alexander,
son of Herod; all those in Crete know
it; all those in Melas know it; and
when I landed at Dicearchia, all the
Jews received me as their king; and
you are not ignorant, great emperor,
that thousands of my countrymen in
Rome, the other day, carried me upon
a royal litter through the streets, and
clothed me in royal robes and ornaments,
and received me, wherever I
went, with shouts of welcome as Herod's
son."</p>

<p>"And you have then," replied Augustus,
after a pause, "been nurtured
as a royal person is in the east?"</p>

<p>"Always," answered the Jew.</p>

<p>"I myself," returned Augustus,
"have seen and known the son Alexander,
as well as his father Herod;
and though you are not unlike the
son, yet you&mdash;<i>show me your hands</i>."</p>

<p>The Jew stretched forth his hands.</p>

<p>"Those hands have toiled from infancy.
Uncover your neck and shoulders."</p>

<p>This was done.</p>

<p>Augustus immediately ordered the
room to be cleared; and it was afterward
known that he had extorted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
confession of his imposture from this
Alexander; and that, sparing his life,
he condemned him to row one of the
state galleys in chains for the rest of
his days.</p>

<p>"Not much like dotage, all this,"
muttered Tiberius to Cneius Piso.</p>

<p>The eastern-looking youth, holding
the hand of the child Caius Caligula,
and followed by Pontius Pilate, waited
for Augustus in a passage&mdash;through
which Paulus and Thellus were now
trying to make their way into the
street.</p>

<p>When the emperor came out, observing
that the youth desired to
speak with him, he stopped, saying,</p>

<p>"What wish you, Herod Agrippa?"</p>

<p>"Emperor, I have told you that
this man is not my uncle."</p>

<p>"And I," said Augustus "have now
settled the question. He is not."</p>

<p>"This officer behind me (Pilate is
his name) has been very obliging to
us ever since our arrival. I wish, my
sovereign, you would send him to
Judea as procurator."</p>

<p>"He is too young," replied Augustus;
"but I will put his name in my
tablets. Perhaps, under my successor,
he may obtain the office."</p>

<p>"I want a favor," cried the child
Caius.</p>

<p>"What is it, orator?" asked Augustus.
(Caligula displayed as a child a
precocious volubility of speech, which
procured him the epithet by which
he was now addressed.)</p>

<p>"That man, that black Jew&mdash;who
pretended to be my friend's uncle&mdash;won't
you put him to death?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Externi sunt isti mores</i>," replied
Augustus, quoting Cicero; "that
would be quite a foreign proceeding.
The anger that sheds unnecessary
blood belongs to the levity of the
Asiatics, or the truculence of barbarians."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Paulus and Thellus,
who had unavoidably overheard these
scraps of conversation, emerged now
once more into the street, and Thellus
guided Paulus to the stables of
Tiberius CÃ¦sar, where they found
Lygdus expecting the visit. He led
them into a long range of buildings,
and showed them, standing in a stall
which had a door to itself, so contrived
as to avoid the necessity of letting
any other horses, when coming
or going, pass him without some intervening
protection, the famous Sejan
steed. The walls were tapestried
with leafy vine-boughs, and the stable
seemed very cool, clean, and well
kept.</p>

<p>The stature of the ominous horse,
as we have had occasion already to
mention, was unusually large; but the
fineness of his form took away the
idea of unwieldiness, and gave a
guarantee of both power and speed.
However, any person who had studied
horses, and was learned in their
<i>points</i>, (which to a great extent merely
means learned in their anatomy,)
would at a glance have condemned
this one's head. It was, indeed, not
lacking in physical elegance, although
not lean enough; the forehead was
very broad, but the eye was not sufficiently
prominent nor mild in expression,
and it shot forth a restless light;
the muzzle and the ears, moreover,
were coarse; the bones, from the eye
down, were too concave, and the nostril
appeared to be too thick. Something
untrustworthy, and almost wicked,
characterized the expression of
the head altogether. The jaws were
wide, and the neck was extraordinarily
deep. The shoulders were not so
flat or so thin as the Romans liked
them to be; the girth round the heart
was vast; the chest broad and full;
the body barrel-shaped. The limbs
were long, (which, says Captain Nolan,
"is weakness, not power;") but
then the bones were everywhere well
covered with muscle, the hind-legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
being remarkably straight in the drop;
in short, they promised an immense
stride, when the animal should be
urged to his fastest gallop.</p>

<p>"Now," said Paulus, after attentively
examining these and a great
many other points, which it would be
too technical for us to detail, "I see
he is not muzzled, but tied by the
head, and I perceive a curious arrangement&mdash;that
platform behind his manger,
and raised somewhat higher than
it. The object is to feed him thence,
and approach him there, I suppose?
Moreover, I observe you have pulleys
in the roof and broad bands depending
from them; do you then lift him
off his legs when you groom him?"</p>

<p>Lygdus assented. Paulus, after
looking attentively at the animal's
hoofs, and forming an idea of the
state of his feet, inquired,</p>

<p>"Is he savage to all alike, or can
you, for instance, approach him?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I always take my precautions,"
answered the slave.</p>

<p>Paulus went round, and stood some
ten minutes in front of the horse on
the raised platform behind the manger,
then shook a double handful of
corn down before him and watched
him eat it. Satisfied at length with
this scrutiny, he now made arrangements
for Philip to remain constantly
in the stable, even sleeping there
at night, and quitting it only to accompany
the horse when taken out
for exercise; and he made it clearly
understood that Philip should superintend
the feeding and grooming of
the animal till he should be led forth
for Paulus to ride him at the appointed
time. We have said nothing to
explain why the youth did not ride
him muzzled, as often and as long as
possible, during the two days which
were still left for preparation; the
fact being that he proposed even now
to do so; but found that, not having
thought of stipulating for this as one of
the conditions, when he had his interview
with Tiberius, orders had been
given to Lygdus that no person
whatever was to mount the horse till
the hour when Paulus was to attempt
his subjugation, in presence of the
court, camp, and people. Very much
disappointed, and blaming his own
want of foresight in not having extorted
so important a right, Paulus now
left the freedman "on duty" in the
stables, Thellus volunteering to revisit
him, and to bring plenty of provisions
of all sorts, and thus to save the
necessity of purveying for him from
the distance of Crispus's inn. When
our hero and the gladiator had retired,
Philip began to make a couch of fresh
and fragrant hay for himself on the
platform behind the manger, muttering,</p>

<p>"But, if I sleep, it shall be with
one eye open and the other not quite
closed. If I find that scoundrel, for
he looks a scoundrel, playing any
tricks, I'll strangle him so surely as I
have five fingers on each hand."</p>

<p>As Philip thus muttered, Lygdus
drew nigh and addressed him.</p>

<p>"Your young master, I fear," he
said, "has not long to live; no one
can ride this horse."</p>

<p>"Three circumstances," replied Philip,
seating himself deliberately on a
roll of hay, "are unknown to you.
I will tell you them. The first is,
that this is not at all a case for mere
horsemanship, although it is not to
be denied that horsemanship is necessary.
Courage and wit are more needful
than any bodily adroitness in reminding
brutes that their master is
man. That is the first circumstance.
The second is, that my young master
learnt his riding among the Ãtolians,
who are not matched in the world."</p>

<p>"Take a sip of wine," said Lygdus,
handing him a flask of hide.</p>

<p>"After you," said the wary old
freedman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span></p>

<p>Lygdus drank a little, wiped the
mouth of the flask with a vine-leaf,
and tendered it once more to Philip,
saying,</p>

<p>"The first and second of your remarks
seem to me to be appropriate,
although I think the Gaulish riders
equal to the Ãtolians. I should like
to hear the third circumstance."</p>

<p>Philip sipped some of the wine,
gave back the vessel to the slave, and
proceeded,</p>

<p>"The third has relation to your
phrase, 'I fear.' My master, Paulus
Lepidus Ãmilius, has been born and
reared to fear death not over-much."</p>

<p>"<i>Edepol!</i>" cried Lygdus; "what is
to be feared more?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Philip, "various things
<em>he</em> fancies, and <em>I</em> fancy so too. Considering
that all men must die, and
can die only once, and that it has become
somehow, I suppose, by practice
and decree, as natural as to be born,
and that we have been doing nothing
for thousands of years but making
way for each other in that manner, it
would be an error to look upon death
as the greatest evil. Why, man, I
should go mad if that which none can
avoid was the greatest evil that any
can incur."</p>

<p>"<i>Edepol!</i>" exclaimed the slave
again; "you are apparently right.
Yet what can be conceived worse
than death? You mean immense
pain, long continuing; in which case
a wise man would put an end to himself."</p>

<p>"<i>Wise!</i>" returned Philip; "but it
would be useless to reason with such
as you. You should have heard, as
I have heard him, Dionysius the
Athenian upon this topic. When you
make such reflections, is it your big
toe, for example, or your belly, or
your elbow, or any part of your body,
that makes them? You may put an
end to your body, and we know what
becomes of it. When it is no longer
fit, as the young Athenian says, to be
the house of that which thinks and
reflects within it, this last departs; for
the body, once dead, ceases to think or
reflect, and as soon as the <em>thinker</em> does
thus depart, the body rots.</p>

<p>"But <i>that other thing</i> which kept
the body from rotting, that other thing
which thinks and reflects, and which
is conscious that it is always the same,
that it always has been itself&mdash;that
<i>other thing</i> which knows its own unalterable
identity through all the
changes of the body, from squalling
childhood to stiff-kneed age&mdash;how can
that other thing, which may easily
depart out of the body and leave it to
perish, <i>depart out of itself</i>? A thing
may leave another thing; but how
can any thing be left by itself? When
this thing, says Dionysius, goes away
from the body, the body always dies.
It was, therefore, the body's life. But
out of its own self this life cannot go
(can any thing go out of itself?) and
if it goes out of the body unbidden,
what will it say to him who had put
it therein when he asks, Sentinel, why
have you quitted your post? Servant,
why have you left your charge?
What brings you hither? I am angry
with you! What will this always conscious,
always identical thing, then reply?"</p>

<p>"You frighten me," said Lygdus.
"What, then, can be more feared by
a reasonable man than death?"</p>

<p>"My young master, for example,"
replied Philip, "so long, be it always
understood, as he is not his own
murderer, would prefer to die in honor
than to live in shame. His father,
the brave Roman tribune, used to
say to him as a boy, that a disgraced
life was worse than a useless life, and
a useless life worse than a noble death.
But who comes hither?"</p>

<p>The interesting little child Caius
Caligula, and the boy Herod Agrippa,
entered the stable as Philip spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! there is the big wild horse,"
cried the sweet infant, who had only
just arrived at the use of his reason;
"but where is the young man that
is to be eaten? I want to tell him
what will become of him, and then to
watch his face."</p>

<p>"He is, I see, even, now coming
back," said Philip sternly. He stood
up as he spoke, and an instant afterward
Paulus, who was attended by
the slave Claudius, bearing a basket
of provisions for old Philip, crossed
the threshold.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Caligula, "you are the
person, are you not, who are to be
first thrown off that horse, next to be
danced upon by him, and finally to
have your head crunched between his
grinders, and that fine wavy hair of
yours will not protect your head?"</p>

<p>"That is a graphic description,"
said Paulus; "but I trust it will not
be realized."</p>

<p>"Are you not very frightened?
Do not you feel very unhappy?"</p>

<p>Paulus seemed to experience some
repugnance to converse with this
child; but guessing him to belong to
the imperial family, he answered with
a calm smile,</p>

<p>"Well, I do not feel the grinders
yet."</p>

<p>"I will fix my eyes fast upon you,"
returned the child, "from the moment
you mount."</p>

<p>"May they be blinded before they
witness what they wish to behold!"
muttered Philip.</p>

<p>During this short conversation,
Lygdus noticed something white
gleaming in a fold of Paulus's tunic
at the side, and picked it, unperceived
by any one, out of the species of
pocket where it lay. Caligula, after
scrutinizing Paulus's face, turned away,
and ran rapidly up the stable, passing
behind the horse.</p>

<p>He skipped and danced a few moments
on the other side, gazing at the
animal, and exclaiming, "Good horse!
fine horse! beautiful horse!"</p>

<p>Lygdus immediately called out to
him not to come back till he had
closed the door of the box, the leaf
of which was on the hither side, and
could be flung to, and the slave proceeded
to do this. But Caligula,
with a sort of skipping run, still uttering
his exclamations and looking sideways
into the stall as he passed, had
already begun to return, giving Sejanus's
heels as wide an offing as the
place allowed. A short, ferocious
whinny, more like the cry of some
wild beast than the neigh of a horse,
was heard, and Sejanus lashed out
his hind-legs.</p>

<p>Caligula would probably have crossed,
beyond range of harm, the line of
this acknowledgment which the brute
was making to him, in return for his
ejaculatory compliments, only for the
very precaution which Lygdus had
taken, and which actually furnished
the animal with a projectile, and
transmitted to a further distance, by
means of the door-leaf, nearly the full
force of the blow. As the door was
swinging home, the powerful hoofs
met it, and, shivering it from top to
bottom, dashed it open again, and
sent the outer edge of it and a large
detached splinter against the middle
of Caligula's forehead and face, from
the hair down along the whole line
of the nose; for, as we have remarked,
his face happened to be turned sideways
to receive the blow just when
it was delivered. He fell insensible;
but having been already in motion,
the united effect of the two forces was
to cast him beyond the reach of any
further usage on the part of the Sejan
steed. Lygdus immediately lifted
him up, and he, with Herod Agrippa,
carried Caligula into the open air.
Paulus and Philip followed; but ascertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
that the injury was superficial,
they returned to the stable,
where they were now left alone.</p>

<p>"I heard him tell you, my master,"
said Philip to Paulus, "that he would
fasten his eyes upon you, when you
mounted yonder brute; now, he will
not open those eyes for a week, and
whatever happens to you, he is not
going to see it. He is not seriously
hurt; he'll be as well as ever in ten
days; but for the present his beauty
is spoilt, and he's as blind as the
dead."</p>

<p>Paulus now in a low tone related
to the freedman, whose services
would be necessary in the matter, the
visit of Charicles, and the gift to him
by that learned man of an unguent
which, if rubbed into the horse's nostrils,
would render him sleepy, and,
therefore, quiet. The old servant expressed
great wonder and admiration
at such a device, and Paulus felt with
his hand for the little porcelain pot
where he remembered to have placed
it. Needless to say, it was gone.</p>

<p>"Well," said the youth, after a few
questions and answers had been exchanged,
"I must even take my
chance without it. Charicles, I hear,
has just been summoned to Rome, so
that I cannot get any more of the
compound. Farewell; I must now return
to Crispus's inn."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>The day when the singular struggle
was to occur, the expectation of
which had excited such curiosity, arose
bright, breezeless, and sultry, and so
continued till long past noon; but
the sun was now sinking toward the
Tyrrhenian Sea, and a cool, soft air
had begun to blow as the hour approached
when the nephew of the
triumvir was to mount the horse Sejanus,
in the presence of such a multitude
as the fields of FormiÃ¦ had
never before beheld, whether in times
of peace or times of war.</p>

<p>At the distance of a few miles on
every side, the fair vales and slopes
of Italy presented the appearance of
a deserted land, over which no sound
was heard save the drowsy hum of
insects, the occasional sough of the
rising breeze in the tops of the woods,
and, predominant over all, far and
near, the piercing ring of the cicala,
with its musical rise and fall and its
measured intervals. The fire of the
wayside forge lay under its ashes;
all its anger taking rest, its hoarse
roar asleep, till the breath of the bellows
should once more awaken it to
resistance and torment it into fury.
All the labors of tillage were suspended;
the plough wearied no team of
oxen; little girls were watching the
flocks and herds. Their fathers and
mothers and brothers had all gone
away since early morning, and would
not return till night-fall. A lonely
traveller from the south, whose horse
had cast a shoe and fallen lame, had
no alternative but to take off bridle
and housings, leave them under a tree
in charge of a little damsel five or six
years old, turn his steed loose in a
soft field of clover, and continue his
own journey on foot along the silent
highway, amid the silent land.</p>

<p>The seats of the temporary amphitheatre
were all filled; while within
and beneath them, standing, but
standing on three several elevations,
contrived by means of planks, (the
rearmost being the highest,) were six
ranks of soldiers from the camp; the
two inner ranks consisting exclusively
of Ãlius Sejanus's prÃ¦torians. Immediately
behind the centre of the
amphitheatre, where Augustus with
his court sat upon a strongly-built,
lofty, and somewhat projecting wooden
platform, canopied from the glare,
a grove of tall and shady trees offered
in their branches an accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
of which the fullest advantage
had been taken by a vast miscellaneous
multitude, chiefly youths and boys;
but among them soldiers who had received
a holiday, and had found no
room for themselves in the amphitheatre,
were also numerous, their costumes
rendering them easily distinguishable.
On each side of the large canopied
platform of the emperor and the
CÃ¦sars, with their court, were several
seats of honor lined with purple and
scarlet cloths, and connected with the
<i>estrade</i> in question by continuous pavilion
roofs, but having their own
benches. Here many ladies and some
boys and girls sat. It is in one of
these we are ourselves going to take
post, invisible but watchful, unheard
but hearing.</p>

<p>On the seat immediately in front
of ours, and of course a little below
it, is a group of three persons, attended
by a slave. With these persons,
and even with their slave, we have
already made more or less acquaintance.
One of them the doctors had
forbidden to go forth; but he had
come. He is a mere child; his pretty
face is shockingly disfigured; both
his eyes are closed and blacked; all
the flesh round them is a discolored
and contused mass, his head is bandaged,
and every nerve in his countenance
is twitching with the furious
eagerness and curiosity of one whose
organs of sight, if he could only see
with them, would ravenously devour
the spectacle which all the rest of
that mighty multitude were to enjoy,
and from which he alone was to be
debarred. Amid the immense murmur
of so many human voices, we
have to listen with attention, in order
to catch distinctly what the child says
in his shrill treble tones.</p>

<p>"Now mark you, good Cneius Piso,
and you, Herod Agrippa, I am as
blind as a stone; and I have brought
you here in no other character than
as my eyes, my left and my right eye.
If a single iota of what passes escapes
me, may all the gods destroy
you both, worse than any Roman or
Jew was ever destroyed before! Has
that beast of a horse (if it was mine,
I'd tether it by all four legs to the
ground, and make a squadron of cavalry
back their horses against it, and
kick it into shreds and little bits)&mdash;has
that beast of a horse come forth
yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, orator," answered Piso.
"I see that your father, the illustrious
Germanicus, has not taken his place
in the emperor's pavilion; he is riding
about yonder in the arena, and
so is Tiberius CÃ¦sar. I dare say
they will prefer to remain on horseback;
for they can thus see quite as
well, while the scene continues to be
enacted in this place, and if the Sejan
horse should break away through the
opening in the amphitheatre opposite
to us, they could follow and still assist
at the issue, whereas we could not.'</p>

<p>"But I <em>want</em> to see; I <em>must</em> see;
I'll get on my pony too! Ah my
sight! I could not ride blind! O
that accursed horse!"</p>

<p>"Then," said Piso, "do you wish
the youth to conquer the horse, or
the horse his rider?"</p>

<p>The child yelled, and struck his
forehead furiously with his fists.</p>

<p>"Oh! If I could only see! I
ought not to have come! It is worse
to be here, knowing what is to happen,
and having it all close under my
eyes, and not to see it, than if I was
far away and without the temptations
around me. It is the hell of Tantalus;
I cannot, <em>cannot</em> bear it."</p>

<p>After a pause of impotent rage, he
asked Piso was the crowd of spectators
very large?</p>

<p>"It is the largest I ever beheld,"
answered Piso; "it would be impossible
to count it, or to guess the number."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish every one present was
stone blind at this very moment," said
the dear child.</p>

<p>"Thanks, orator, on the part of all
here present," answered Piso.</p>

<p>"Understand me&mdash;only for the moment,"
hastily returned Caligula; "I
would give them their sight again
when I recovered my own." A pause.
"Or even when to-day's show was
over, perhaps."</p>

<p>While yet he spoke, the hum and
murmur, which had been incessant,
died rapidly away.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Caligula.</p>

<p>"The Sejan horse is being led into
the arena; two men, as usual, hold
two cavassons on opposite sides. He
is muzzled; two other grooms are
now slackening the muzzle, in order
to get the bit well back between his
teeth by pulling up the reins which
are under the muzzle, as the horse
opens his mouth.</p>

<p>"They have the bit properly placed
now, and have quitted his head.
Oh! what a spring! It has jerked
the further cavasson-holder clean off
his feet. O gods! he has lost the
cavasson, and the other man must be
destroyed. No, bravo! the fellow
has regained the loop of his rein or
thong, and hauls the beast handsomely
back!"</p>

<p>"How can one man on either side,"
asked Caligula, "hold him? I have
seen two on each side."</p>

<p>"I understand," replied Piso; but
before he could finish his explanation
or remark, or whatever it was designed
to be, a sudden and impressive silence
fell upon that vast assembly,
and Piso stopped short.</p>

<p>"What has happened now?" whispered
the child.</p>

<p>"The rider has come forth," answered
Piso, "and is walking toward
the horse from the direction of the
open space in front of us. By Jupiter!
a splendid youth; it is not to be
denied."</p>

<p>"How is he dressed? Has he his
whip and <i>stimuli</i> (spurs)? He will
not need such helps, I surmise."</p>

<p>"He has no spurs, and he carries
nothing in his hands. He wears that
foreign-looking head-gear, the broad-rimmed
petasus, as a shade, no doubt,
against the level rays of the sunset; for
I see he is giving directions to the
grooms, and they are contriving to
bring the horse round with his head
toward the west. Ah! he thus faces
the opening; I dare say he will try
to push the animal into the excitement
of a grand rush, and thus weary
him at the outset. In that case, we
shall not see much of the business;
he will be miles away over the country
in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"You will find that such an injustice
will not be allowed," answered
the child. "We must not be cheated
out of our rights."</p>

<p>"His tunic," continued Piso, "is
belted tight, and I perceive that he
wears some kind of greaves, which
reach higher than the knee, that will
protect him from the brute's teeth.
Moreover, I notice a contrivance in
the horse's housings to rest the feet&mdash;you
might call them <i>stapedÃ¦</i>; they
seem to be made of plaited hide."</p>

<p>"I don't care for his greaves," returned
the child; "the teeth may not
wound him, but they will pull him
off or make him lose his balance all
the same. It is agreed, is it not, that,
as soon as he is mounted, the muzzle
is to be slipped off the horse?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Piso.</p>

<p>"Then the rest is certain," said
the other. "How is it contrived, do
you know?" added he.</p>

<p>"The muzzle consists of a mere
roll of hide," replied Piso; "and it is
those long reins alone which keep it
folded, being passed in opposite directions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
round the animal's nose;
while therefore both the reins are
pulled, or held tight, they bind the
muzzle; but when one of them only
is pulled, it opens the muzzle. Each
groom has the same kind of double
rein; and each, acting in concert,
will set the beast free as soon as they
receive the signal."</p>

<p>"Who gives the signal?"</p>

<p>"The rider himself, when he is fairly
seated; but Tiberius will tell him
when to mount."</p>

<p>"Go on with your description of
his dress and his looks. Does he
seem afraid?"</p>

<p>"He still wears that queer sword;
I should have fancied it cumbersome
to him. Afraid! I should say not.
No sign of it.</p>

<p>"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ver omnes!</i>"</p>

<p>At first, this dialogue was sustained
in a whisper; but as the lull of all
noise was again gradually replaced
by that hoarse hum, which is blent
out of a hundred thousand low-toned
murmured words, Piso and the child
Caligula raised their own voices, and
the last exclamation of Piso was as
loud as it was sudden.</p>

<p>"Has any thing further taken
place?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Cneius Piso;
"and something which I do not understand.
That old freedman of the
youth, together with Thellus the gladiator,
have approached him, and
Thellus holds in each hand a sort of
truncheon about a yard or more long;
the top of which for more than a foot
is black; the rest is sheathed or plated
in bronze; the black top of the truncheon
is thick; the rest, which is
sheathed in the metal, is much thinner.
The freedman who is by Thellus's
side holds a small horn lantern
in one hand, and tenders with the
other a pair of large woollen <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chirothecÃ¦</i>
(gloves) to his young master, who
is even now putting them on. As he
puts on his gloves, he looks round the
benches; he is looking our way now.
What can he mean? He has the audacity
to wave his hand, and smile,
and nod in this direction!"</p>

<p>The slave whom we have mentioned
as forming the fourth in this group
was no other than Claudius, whose
part Paulus was now performing.</p>

<p>"By your leave, most honored
lords," said Claudius, "I think I am
the person whom that valiant youth
is saluting."</p>

<p>"True," said Piso; "he has taken
your destined office to-day, has he
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," returned Claudius;
"and having caught sight of me, he
beckoned to me, doubtless, to bid me
have good courage."</p>

<p>"Well!" ejaculated Piso, "that is a
good joke. I think it is you who
ought to beckon to him to have good
courage. He needs it more than
you."</p>

<p>A moment after this remark, Cneius
Piso suddenly turned to the child
Caligula, and informed him that Tiberius
was signing to him (Piso) to go
down into the arena, and mount one
of the spare horses; and, although
unwillingly, he must go.</p>

<p>"And how shall I know what occurs?"
cried the passionate, voluble
boy. "It is like plucking out one of
my eyes. Herod Agrippa here speaks
Latin with such a dreadful, greasy
accent, and so slowly; he is but learning
the language."</p>

<p>Piso rose and said, "I have no
choice but to obey; you have the
slave Claudius with you; he not only
speaks fluently, but I'll answer for it
he will watch all the stages of the
struggle with at least as much attention
as any person in all this crowd
will! His liberty, his wedding, and
fifty thousand sesterces are at stake."</p>

<p>Saying this, he descended the steps
of the narrow gangway which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
(with scores of similar stairs) the means
contrived for reaching and quitting
the higher seats in the temporary circus.
A few moments afterward, he
was seen in the arena riding by the
side of Tiberius to and fro.</p>

<p>"Now, slave, remember your duty,"
cried the child Caligula; "let nothing
escape <em>your</em> eyes or my ears. What
next?"</p>

<p>"Those queer-looking staves, my
lord, which the illustrious Cneius Piso
has mentioned as being in the
hands of Thellus, have passed into
those of the young knight, who is to
conquer the terrible brute."</p>

<p>"What? the two truncheons with
black, thick ends, and the rest of their
length sheathed in metal? do you say
that the knight Paulus has taken them
into his hands? What good can they
do him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord; he has now passed
both of them into his left hand, and
holds them by the thin ends. Thellus
has withdrawn a few paces; the
old freedman, Philip, remains still near
the youth. Ha!"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Tiberius CÃ¦sar has signalled the
arena to be cleared. O gods! we
shall soon see the issue now. I care
not for my freedom; I care for the
safety of that brave young knight."</p>

<p>"Does he, then, seem to shrink?"
asked the child.</p>

<p>"I do not," replied Claudius, "observe
any shrinking, my lord. It is I
who shrink. He has drawn slowly
near the horse in front, and stands
about half a yard from his left shoulder.
He is following Tiberius CÃ¦sar
with his eyes."</p>

<p>"Go on!"</p>

<p>"The arena is now clear of all save
on the one hand the two CÃ¦sars and
their retinues, who have taken their
stand very near to us, just opposite to
and beneath this platform, my lord;
and on the other hand, the group
around that horrible animal. Ah!
me miserable! Tiberius CÃ¦sar lifts his
hand, and you hear the trumpet! That
is the signal."</p>

<p>"I hear it! I hear it!" cried the
child, in a sort of ecstasy. "What
follows now? Has the knight Paulus
mounted?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord; he has&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He shrinks, does he not?" interrupted
the other with a taunting giggle.</p>

<p>"The horse trembles in every limb,"
said the slave; "his nostrils dilate and
quiver, and show scarlet, as if on fire;
and his eyes shoot forth a blood-red
gleam, and he has stooped his head,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the man, the man?" screamed
Caius; "what of him? Has he
not failed, I say&mdash;lost heart?"</p>

<p>The most profound stillness had
succeeded to the hubbub of blended
sounds which a moment previously
filled the air.</p>

<p>A trumpet blew a shrill prolonged
minor note, and the child, laying his
hand upon Claudius's shoulder, and
shaking him violently, cried to him to
proceed with his descriptions; addressing
to him again the query, "Has
that young man mounted? And if
so, in what style, with what success?"</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the despotic impatience
with which the inquiries
were urged, the slave Claudius did
not at first reply; and the infant heard
rapid, eager murmurs on all sides follow
the trumpet blast, then a general
burst of exclamations, which were instantly
hushed.</p>

<p>"Why do you not speak?" said
Caius, in a species of whispered scream.</p>

<p>"Pardon a momentary abstraction,"
replied Claudius. "While the trumpet
was yet sounding, the young
knight Paulus took off his hat quickly,
and bowed toward Tiberius CÃ¦sar
and the emperor; and replacing his
hat, he beckoned to the freedman Philip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
This last has approached him,
and they are even now speaking together."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" interrupted the child;
"then he has not mounted. He neither
dares nor can he."</p>

<p>"Philip," pursued Claudius, "has
opened the lantern; his young master
is thrusting the staves toward the
light; the ends have caught fire, in a
dull degree, with some smoke accompanying
the flame. He turns quickly
away from the freedman, and holding
the staves still in his left hand,
and a little away, he approaches the
horse; now he stands with his feet
close together. Oh! he has sprung
clean from the ground; he is in his
seat. He has seized the bridle in his
right hand, and carried it to his mouth;
he takes it between his teeth. He is
now relieving his left hand of one of
those torches; he holds one in each
hand, somewhat away from the body,
nearly horizontal. The cavasson-holders
at a distance are removing
the muzzle, and the rider sends his
feet firmly, yet I think not very far,
through those rests which the illustrious
Cneius Piso mentioned, those <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stapedÃ¦</i>
of hide, the like of which I never
saw before. I wonder they are not
always used."</p>

<p>"What of the horse? Is he motionless?"</p>

<p>"Not less so than a statue," replied
the slave; "excepting the eyes and
nostrils, which last exhibit a tremulous
movement, and show scarlet, like
hollow leaves or thin shells on fire.
The brute's concave head, from the
scarlet nostril to the lurid eye, looks
wicked and dire."</p>

<p>"How looks the rider?"</p>

<p>"Calm and heedful; the slight occasional
breath of air from the east
carries away to the front the slow
flame, blent with a little smoke of
those torches which he holds one in
each hand."</p>

<p>"What can they be for?"</p>

<p>"I know not," replied Claudius.</p>

<p>"I suppose they are intended,"
said the child, "to compel the Sejan
horse to keep his head straight. Thus
your volunteer-substitute need not
fear the beast's teeth. The issue seems
then to be reduced to a trial of sheer
horsemanship."</p>

<p>"And in such a trial, most honored
sir," replied the slave, "I begin to
have hopes. You should see the
youth. The leading-reins are now
loose. The muzzle is snatched away,
and the contest has begun. Surely it
seems one between a wild beast and
a demigod."</p>

<p>"Is he thrown?"</p>

<p>"No; yes; so help me! he is off,
but is off standing."</p>

<p>"Explain; proceed&mdash;I tell you,
proceed!"</p>

<p>"The horse, after a series of violent
plunges, suddenly reared till he had
nearly gained a perpendicular position
upon his hind-legs, the fore-feet
pawing the air. The rider, who seemed
to be as little liable to fall as though
he had been part of the animal, then
quickly passed his right foot out of
the far <i>stapeda</i>, and dropping the bridle
from his teeth, slipped down on
the hither side. Hark! did you hear
the crash with which the fore-paws
have come down? The steed seemed
to be very near falling backward,
but after a struggle of two or three
seconds, recovered himself; the centre
of his weight had not been carried
rearward of the vertical line; and, O
ye gods! just as you heard that ponderous
thud with which he descended
upon his fore-feet, the youth darted
from the ground with a spring like
his first, and he is now on the brute's
back as before. He stoops to the
horse's neck; he has caught the bridle
in his teeth, and lifts that brave, clear
face again. Listen to the multitude!
Oh! how the <i>euge</i>, <i>euge</i>, thunders from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
a hundred thousand sympathetic
voices!"</p>

<p>"Ah my sight!" cried the child
Caligula.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" continued Claudius,
transported out of himself. "I shall
get my liberty to-day! Nor will my
benefactor be injured. Ha! ha!
The fell beast of a horse seems astonished.
How he writhes his back,
curving it like some monstrous catamount.
And lo! now he leaps from
the ground with all four feet at the
same time! I never saw the like,
except in animals of the cervine tribe.
Ha! ha! leap away! Yes, stoop
that ferocious-looking head, and shake
it; and lash out with your death-dealing
hoofs. Your master is upon
you, in his chair of power, and you'll
shake your head off before you dislodge
him from it. It is not with
the poor literary slave Claudius that
you have to deal! Oh! what a paroxysm
of plunges. I was frightened
for you, then, brave young knight;
but there you sit yet, calm and clear-faced.
If I was frightened for you,
you are not frightened for yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh! for a few minutes' sight!"
said the child. "Has not the horse
tried to twist his head round, and so
to bring his teeth into play?"</p>

<p>"Even now he tries," replied Claudius;
"but he is met on either side
by the torch. The fiercest beast of
the desert shrinks from fire. Prudent
and fortunate device! Lo! the horse
seems at last to have ascertained that
he who has this day mounted him is
worthy of his services; do you hear
the tread of his hoofs, as he traces
the circle of the arena, guided by
those steady hands from which flames
appear to flow. Faster and faster
rushes the steed, always restrained
and turned by the outer torch, which
is brought near his head, while the
inner is held further to the rear. His
sides are flecked with foam. The
pace grows too rapid for a short
curve, and the steed is now guided
straight for the western opening in
the arena opposite to where we sit;
while the light breeze from the east
counteracts the current of air made
by the animal's own career, and keeps
the flare of those torches almost even.
They are gone; and again hark! Is
not that shout like the roar of waters
on a storm-beaten shore, as a hundred
thousand men proclaim the success
of a generous and brave youth, who
could face the chance of being torn
limb from limb in order to give to
a poor slave like me, condemned to
a frightful death, his life and his liberty,
a home and a future?"</p>

<p>"But surely," said the imperial
child, "it is not over so soon. It is
like a dream."</p>

<p>"I have tried to make you see
what I saw," returned Claudius. "It
was a wonderful struggle&mdash;the youth
looked beautiful; and in the swift
whirl, as you beheld the graceful and
perfect rider, his hands apparently
streaming with flames, and his face
so calm and clear, you would have
imagined that it was one of those
beings whom the poets have feigned
and sung, as having gifts superior to
the gifts of ordinary mortals, who was
delivering some terror-stricken land
from a demon, from a cruel monster,
and compelling ferocity, craft, uproar,
and violence to bend to far higher
forces, to man's cool courage and
man's keen wit."</p>

<p>Augustus, in his later years, showed
a decreasing relish for the bloodier
sports of the arena; and, in deference
to his taste, the next spectacles
were, first a mere wrestling-match,
and then a combat at the cestus, in
which the effort was to display skill
rather than inflict injury.</p>

<p>This contest was just over, and the
sun, as if in wide-flowing garments
of red and golden clouds, had sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
level with the broad western opening
of the amphitheatre, when the hum
of voices was hushed once more, and
Claudius was commanded in a whisper
to resume his task of rendering
the scene upon which the child's
bodily eyes were temporarily closed,
visible to his mind.</p>

<p>"I cannot with certainty discern,"
said the slave, "what occurs; there
is such a vast heavenly shield of red
light hanging opposite to us in the
western sky. Against it, approaching
at a walking pace toward the gap
in the arena, along that avenue of
chestnut trees in the country, I see
a horseman. All eyes are turned in
that direction. It is <em>he</em>; it is Paulus
Lepidus Ãmilius, returning on the
Sejan steed; the animal is enveloped
in sweat, and dust, and foam; and
rather stoops the head which looked
so fierce two hours ago; the rider
has thrown away those torches, and
now holds the reins low down on
either side, a little in front of the
beast's shoulder. His hat is gone,
and his brown locks, as you see them
against the sun, are so touched with
the light that he seems to wear a
head-gear of golden flames. Hark!
again, as before, the people and the
army shout to him. He is bowing
to them on each side; and now, as
he advances, what do I see?"</p>

<p>The slave paused, and the child
impatiently cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"How can I tell what you see,
you dog? You are here for no other
purpose than to tell <em>me</em> that."</p>

<p>"He has streaks of blood upon his
forehead," resumed Claudius.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" cried the other; "the
branches of the trees have no doubt
struck him. Is he pale? Does he
look faint? Is he going to fall off?"</p>

<p>"No," said Claudius; "he has
reined in the horse, which stands like
a horse of stone in the middle of the
arena. Tiberius and Germanicus
have both ridden toward him, with
their retinues of mounted officers behind
them. They have halted some
six yards from him. They are speaking
to him. As they speak, he bows
his head and smiles. A crowd of
people on foot have broken into the
arena. The grooms have drawn
near, at a sign from Tiberius; they
are cautiously approaching the Sejan
beast; but this last shows no restiveness.
They have slipped the muzzle
round his nose, under the reins. The
youth dismounts. I do not see him
now; he has become mixed with the
crowd, I think; yes, it must be so,
for I miss him altogether."</p>

<p>Augustus now rose, and his rising
was taken by the multitude as a signal
that the entertainments of the
amphitheatre for that evening had
closed.</p>

<p>Half an hour more and the scene
was left to its solitude; and where
the cries and shouts of that mighty
assemblage had mounted to the very
heavens, there was no sound left except
the humming of the insects and
the rustling of the trees.</p>

<p>That night, in the large veranda or
bower, which hung its arch of leaves
and flowers over the landing of the
Lady Aglais's apartments, at the Inn
of the Hundredth Milestone, were
assembled an exceedingly heterogeneous
but mutually attached company,
with every member of which the
reader has made acquaintance. Paulus's
mother, his young sister Agatha,
Claudius, (no longer a slave, and now
wearing the <i>pileus</i>,) Crispina, with
her daughter Benigna, the betrothed
of this slave Claudius, Thellus the
gladiator, and Dionysius the Athenian,
were there, and they all heard
Paulus relate a very strange occurrence,
with which he made them acquainted
in the following terms:</p>

<p>"Mother," said he, "the most extraordinary
incident connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>
this happy day remains to be told.
I am sure that the great and mysterious
Being who is expected by
Dionysius here soon to descend upon
earth, and to whom I offered my life,
has protected me this day. He has
surely protected me, and has received
with favor my endeavor to rescue
from brutal power an oppressed and
innocent young couple. The most
extraordinary incident connected with
my undertaking, I say, is not yet
known to you. Last night I could
not sleep soundly. At last, long before
daybreak, I rose, dressed myself,
and, kneeling down, besought that
Being who is to appear among us to
remember that I was trying to please
him by this enterprise, and that I
was acting just as Dionysius and I
had concluded it would be agreeable
to this beneficent being. An inexpressible
feeling of calmness and confidence
arose in my heart as I rose
from my knees. I then took my hat
and went out of doors. I first strolled
yonder, up and down that laurel
walk in the garden, and afterward
sauntered into the fields and wandered
pretty far, but I observed not
whither. Presently I began to feel
that inclination to sleep which had
deserted me in my bedroom; and,
knowing the sun would soon rise, I
chose a shady spot under a clump of
trees, and, lying down, fell fast asleep
immediately. <i>I had no dream</i>, but
was waked by feeling a hand upon
my forehead. Opening my eyes, I
beheld a woman, very aged and
venerable, but with a most beautiful
countenance, despite her years, bending
over me. Her countenance was
solemn as the stars, and, I know not
how, impressed me like the face of
the heavens at midnight, when the
air is clear and calm. Her hair was
not gray, but white&mdash;white as milk.
She wore a long, black mantle, the
hood of which, like that of Agatha's
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ricinium</i>, was brought over the head,
but not further than the middle of
the head, so that I could see, when
I rose to my feet, (as I instantly did,)
that her long flowing white locks
were parted evenly and fell below the
shoulder on each side. She held in
her left hand a long staff, and her
right was extended toward me as if
bespeaking attention. She said to me
in Greek these words: '<span class="smcap">By means
of fire you can subdue the ferocious
beast</span>.' She then laid the
hand which was stretched forth upon
my head for a second, drew the hood
further over her head, and departed
with swift steps, leaving me to gaze
after her in amazement&mdash;an amazement
which increased when I perceived
that her words could be applied
to the Sejan horse. It was
those words, mother, and nothing
else, which gave me the idea of employing
the torches, which my good
Thellus here afterward prepared for
me out of some gladiatorial exercise-weapons
which he possessed; and I
may for certain say that, without the
torches, I must have been destroyed
by that horrible brute."</p>

<p>"You truly describe this incident
as extraordinary, my son," said the
Lady Aglais, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Paulus," said Dionysius, "<i>you have
seen the Sibyl</i>. You must accompany
me in a few days to CumÃ¦, where
we will seek an interview with her,
upon the subject concerning which
all the Sibyls sing and prophesy&mdash;the
general reparation of this disorder-tortured
world."</p>

<h2>MATTER AND SPIRIT IN THE LIGHT OF MODERN
SCIENCE<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></h2>


<p>There is nothing more advantageous,
and at the same time more
dangerous; more beneficial to the
cause of truth, and yet more apt to
induce error, than the modern idea of
studying man in nature alone; or rather,
of scrutinizing its depths with
the design of discovering all that concerns
him.</p>

<p>Doubtless there were times when
philosophy did not pay sufficient regard
to the study of the physical sciences;
when philosophers put themselves
too far outside the physical
world. Metaphysics were too full of
abstractions, too much confined to the
<em>me</em> and consciousness.</p>

<p>Some systems wished to dig an
abyss between the world of matter
and that of spirit, regarding the passage
from the one to the other as impossible.
Even the discoveries of
Des Cartes in the realms of physical
nature, as well as in the kingdom of
his own consciousness, notwithstanding
their importance and grandeur,
only served to widen the abyss; for
the Cartesian theory supposed the
mind to be incapable of communicating
with the exterior world save by a
chain frequently broken&mdash;by a long
and devious path. The <i>preÃ«stablished harmony</i>
of Leibnitz was the last
term of the separation of these two
worlds, which had no longer any
thing in common even in their agreement,
and only existed in juxtaposition
without mutual action or reciprocal
influence.</p>

<p>This was an excess of which metaphysics
was at the same time the author
and the victim; it deprived itself
of a powerful element of investigation;
it veiled one of the faces
of nature; and closed the door to research
and knowledge in one of the
great domains of the world. Metaphysicians,
in striving to obtain the
exclusive and victorious reign of spirit,
compromised its triumph.</p>

<p>Doubtless that which at the same
time unites and separates the intellectual
from the material world will never
be perfectly understood. But it
will always be necessary to throw
light on both sides of the problem
by comparing them without confounding
them; to place both face to face
without partiality or exclusion; the
working of thought and of matter,
and between the two the mysterious
phenomenon of life which is their connecting
link and term of similitude.</p>

<p>It could not be expected that philosophy
should first and alone prepare
the ground of this conciliation
and comparison. The peculiarly speculative
studies of metaphysicians
would not naturally carry them to
this point; and besides, the very elements
necessary for this comparison
were wanting to them.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, to the natural sciences,
as they are called, that we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
owe the most of our knowledge and
comprehension of the two worlds,
which co-penetrate each other. Not
that the sciences have preconceived
the thought of this result, and formed
a plan on the subject; for the science
of the day, especially that which really
deserves the name, has confined
itself generally to impartial discoveries,
and for premise and conclusion
has taken merely the facts themselves.
Notwithstanding evil examples, which
would persuade a different course, it
still perseveres, and on this account
it deserves praise in its isolated labors
and exclusive studies. It would not
be difficult to cite the names of some
of the most distinguished <i>savants</i>,
who, impartially and without being
preoccupied with conclusions, have
enriched the domain of truth with
most important and curious discoveries.
But the occupation of the
<i>savant</i>, which is not without merit and
trouble, cannot satisfy mankind.</p>

<p>By a natural instinct man feels the
want of synthesis; he is not content
with mere phenomena. He wants
to go further than analysis; he longs
to generalize and draw consequences.
He wishes to profit by past labor; he
wants to know not only results but
causes.</p>

<p>Here philosophy must again be
called in to judge of and compare
facts, to deduce consequences from,
and erect systems upon them. If the
spiritualist philosophers, quitting abstractions
and leaving the solitude of
consciousness, have by an enlightened
change, which will be serviceable
both to truth and to their own cause,
begun to dig deeply into the scientific
mine which is so rich and productive;
on the other hand, the positivists and
materialists, forced by the natural inclination
of the human mind to draw
conclusions and build theories, even
after proclaiming the sovereign reign
of matter, and after trying to remain
in it alone; after attributing to it every
property and every function; after
making it the absolute foundation of
their doctrine and teaching, have here
admitted that an inferior supposes a
superior order; there accepted final
causes; elsewhere invoked the ideal
or spoken of truths which are eternal;
and in their desire to explain the
phenomena of matter or the forms of
life, they have been compelled to
leave the region of purely material
facts and to ascend to those metaphysical
ideas which in theory they
so strenuously reject.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>But although the human mind, placed
in presence of problems, goes faster
and further than science, yet it cannot
do without its aid; it rightly seeks
its assistance, and finds in it one of
its most solid and safe foundations.</p>

<p>We have, therefore, deemed it interesting
to indicate at what point
the labors of the physicists have
arrived, even by exhibiting their premature
solutions. We think it useful
to examine some of their conclusions,
which have been deduced rather precipitately
perhaps, but which, while
treating only of bodies, concern more
or less directly the sovereign questions
of the soul and of the intelligence.</p>

<p>We must say that, in consequence
of so many deep researches and fruitful
experiments, the empire of the
natural sciences has been so vastly
extended that nothing in the future
seems impossible of attainment, while
most unexpected results, intoxicating,
as it were, and turning the heads of
<i>savants</i>, have seemed to furnish a justification
of their defence of even the
most rash and surprising theories.</p>

<p>There has been a regeneration of
ideas regarding the material world;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>analysis has probed to its lowest
depths and let in the light of day.
Men think they have discovered its
mode of action and arrived at its
very elements.</p>

<p>Two leading theories have been
produced, both of which pretend to
be based on the most minute verification
of details and the most recent
facts. If they are not absolutely
irreconcilable, they present at least
very different formulas.</p>

<p>The one affirms that there is nothing
in matter except movement.</p>

<p>The other declares that there is
nothing in matter but forces.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The system which reduces every
thing in matter to movements is as
simple as it is curious. It exhibits
at the same time a character of grandeur
and of unity which is seductive.
Matter in the universe, it says,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> remains
the same in quantity; it is
neither created nor destroyed; its
phenomena are merely transformations.</p>

<p>According to this system, the <i>abstract
notion of force</i> does not exist.
Force is a cause of motion; and the
cause of motion is a motion itself.
Physical phenomena, as heat, light,
electricity, and magnetism, are certain
kinds of motion, which beget
each other. Heat is transformed into
electricity and electricity into light.
Transformations take place according
to fixed rules, and are reduced to
rigorously determined unities.</p>

<p>In another order of facts, cohesion,
chemical affinity, and gravity, are
equally the effects of communication
of motion, since the phenomena which
derive from them exist only by attraction&mdash;that
is to say, by the movement
of molecules and bodies toward
each other.</p>

<p>The same rule holds good in the
system of the universe; the heavenly
as well as the terrestrial bodies have
not in themselves that which attracts
them to each other. Universal gravitation
is only the expression of a
result; it merely means that every
thing happens as if bodies had the
intrinsic property of attracting each
other in the direct ratio of their quantity
and the inverse ratio of their distance.</p>

<p>It is not this force or property; it
is the ether which is the cause of attraction.
The ether is composed of
atoms which collide with each other
and with neighboring bodies. It is
everywhere diffused, forming a universal
medium, and exercising a continual
pressure on all the molecules
in nature. The gravity of bodies is
owing to the pressure of this medium.
Their movement is, as it were, a transformation
of the motions of ether.
Thus, the ether, moving in every
direction, and obeying no fixed pressure,
produces material attraction
without being subject to it; it gives
to bodies their gravity, while it remains
itself imponderable.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>It had been already physically demonstrated
that sound and light were
the result of undulations&mdash;that is,
of motions; sonorous and luminous
movements which have been measured
and verified in all their modes.
The nature of caloric movement has
not yet been so completely understood;
but the mechanical effects of
heat have been established in the
most precise manner. The identity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>of heat and of mechanical labor has
become a commonly received idea
for several years past. Heat, which
was formerly regarded as a material
substance, is now considered as a
mere mode of motion; it is by their
repercussion that the molecules of
bodies cause us to experience the
sensation of heat; and the intensity
of these repercussions determines the
degrees of temperature. This heat,
manifesting itself by different effects,
produces now light or sounds, again
mechanical labor.</p>

<p>The energy or the living force
which molecules or bodies in motion
possess, in a degree exactly known, is
partially lost if these molecules produce
a work, that is to say, if they
displace a quantity of matter; but in
that case the living force which they
lose is stored up in the labor produced,
and is reborn when the latter
ceases to exist.</p>

<p>Just as the calorific and luminous
fluids are no longer regarded as possessing
a special substance and existence,
so also the electric fluid, positive
as well as negative, and the magnetic
fluid, which is only one of its derivatives,
are but opposite movements of
matter. The electrical movement of
imponderable matter, or ether, is not
even a vibratory motion; it is a real
current, a real transport which takes
place in the conducting body; and
it is so far of the same nature as the
luminous motion that it has approximately
the same velocity&mdash;that is to
say, it travels seventy-five thousand
leagues a second.</p>

<p>Now, all these motions of heat, all
these motions of light and electricity,
which correlative phenomena offer,
are all reducible to the idea of mechanical
labor. Produced by one labor,
they reproduce another. Thus
disappear from chemistry, as from the
natural sciences, the forces called repulsive
as well as those called attractive.
The molecules no longer
act at a distance; actions take place
by contact, by the communication
of movements. In the same way
the pressure exercised by the ethereal
atoms on the molecules of the sidereal
bodies takes the place of the
initial force or acquired velocity
which astronomy regarded as the
cause of their movements.</p>

<p>According to this sovereign unity,
the physical world is composed of
one single element. There are no
simple bodies. Oxygen and hydrogen,
like gold or platina, are composed
only of atoms. There is no difference
in material quality; properties
vary according to the diversity of
movements. Becoming grouped and
interwoven, the atoms form the molecules,
and the changes of these movements
constitute for us the different
phenomena, the mode of which depends
on the masses and the velocities
which are in play.</p>

<p>Consequently, ethereal atoms, elementary
molecules, compound or
chemical molecules, particles of gaseous
bodies, liquids, solids&mdash;such is the
hierarchy of phenomena.</p>

<p>The system is triumphantly epitomized
in these words:</p>

<p>Atoms and motion form the universe.</p>

<p>Let us pause before this conclusion,
the simplicity of which is not without
grandeur, although the theory is
absolute and hasty. Let us be allowed
to interfere in the name of the
notion of causality, in the name of
that metaphysics to which the system
itself, although taking its starting-point
from facts alone, renders homage
by its generalizations and by its
synthesis. If it confined itself exclusively
to its conclusion, that atom and
movement form the supreme axiom
of the universe, we should have downright
materialism. The author avoids
this absolute conclusion, which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
cause us, moreover, to go outside the
limits of scientific research, and he
admits that even in motion there are
original causes which remain entirely
unknown.</p>

<p>But this cannot suffice. Our mind
sees this reserve and will not rest
satisfied with it.</p>

<p>If the system merely gives to ethereal
atoms the intrinsic force and
primitive motion which it takes away
from the molecules and bodies, it
only postpones the difficulty and
avoids the true solution. It merely
admits an effect without assigning
to it an origin or a reason of being.
It does not indicate the primary
cause of motion; it does not make
known the prime mover, which neither
facts nor reason can place in the atoms
or in the phenomena.</p>

<p>Nor can the formation of worlds
be explained by atoms and motion.
The author<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> gives up facts, reality,
and the logic of his own system when
he supposes some of the chief primitive
atoms forming the centre of a group
for several others, and thus constituting
a sphere. Then, after this operation
in the universal mass, the molecular
groups appear gifted with gravity
and enter into that evolution
which constitutes the admirable order
of the universe.</p>

<p>We have no longer modern science
arriving, by way of decomposition and
analysis, at results as curious as they
are incontestable. It is, in truth, but
the renewal of an old system which
goes as far back as ancient philosophy&mdash;to
Leucippus, to Democritus, to
Epicurus; a system without foundation
or reality, which brings us to
gross materialism, and gives us no rational
or experimental explanation of
phenomena.</p>

<p>For whence have these atoms
come? Do you give them their
reason of being by simply calling
them primitive? Do they exist from
all eternity, or have they created
themselves? After being proclaimed
indivisible points, they are, contrary
to this principle of unity, made unequal
and preponderating. Whence
do they derive these contradictory,
and at the same time indispensable
characters, which enable them to perform
their functions? Who has given
them the first motion necessary for
their meeting? Or, if they have been
eternally in motion, does it not follow
that the formations that are attributed
to them must be also eternal?
What causes them to produce
ponderable molecules and to become
heavy bodies while they are essentially
imponderable and devoid of attraction?</p>

<p>As for us, a friend of truth, and believing
that it can never be opposed
to itself, having in its regard no fear
or party prejudice, we are disposed
to accept willingly the results given
by scientific observation and experience,
provided there be no disposition
to draw conclusions from them
which are not legitimate. We are
far from disputing that matter is one
in its grand simplicity, and that it is
reducible to elements of one species;
that phenomena of a single order,
motion, produce all the effects of nature
which we admire. The spiritualist
philosophy will readily find in
these atoms their first author, God,
and in these movements God, the
prime mover.</p>

<p>We also admit willingly that this
theory holds good even in the domain
of organized matter, and that,
in the regular order of succession, it
runs through all the kingdoms. We
see nothing in this admission which
contradicts directly our belief.</p>

<p>In fact, the system extends even to
the order of living nature, and there
it points out two things.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it indicates, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
basis and chief constituent of living
beings, the very materials of the inorganic
world, the solid bodies, liquids,
gases, which we find in all organizations,
and especially in the human organization,
the most complex of all;
for this organization comprises fourteen
of those elements which we call
simple bodies, because we have not
been able as yet to reduce them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in animated nature
itself there takes place a series
of motions which succeed each other
according to a determined order, with
an especial character, yet not opposed
to the laws of molecular mechanism;
so that in the human body in
motion heat is transformed into work
and work into heat, according to the
ordinary relation of calorics, and the
human mover gives in labor the same
proportion of heat produced as the
other movers.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Does this mean, continues the author
of the system, that we have in
this process all the elements of life?
What is the cause which forms the
first cell, the basis of living bodies?
What deduces from it the developments
of being? What limits and
regulates its evolution? "Here we
must suspend our judgment, or admit
a special cause, the principle of which
is peculiar to vital phenomena."</p>

<p>This cause, although its nature is
unknown and undetermined, is manifested
by movements, and may take,
according to the same order of ideas,
the <i>rÃ´le</i> and name of vital force.
This force is endowed with a peculiar
activity, which transforms without
creating, just as motion only transforms
in virtue of anterior movements.</p>

<p>This doctrine, pushed to extremity,
seems to infer that the phenomena of
thought and volition are only pure
movements, the result of physical or
vital actions. But is not the human
soul, the animating principle, thereby
put in danger?</p>

<p>The author thinks not. "In the
midst of material transformations,"
says he, "causes active by nature may
intervene, and we have instanced
some of them, in marking the nature
and limits of such intervention. This
is sufficient to leave the ground free
to all the solutions of metaphysics."</p>

<p>We are more affirmative and precise.
These causes, from the starting-point
of the atom and movement,
necessarily exist and act. In fact, if
the atom and movement are the universe,
outside the universe there must
be and there is something superior to
the atom and to motion&mdash;that which
has given them birth; for we cannot
suppose that the atom exists by itself,
nor that motion is produced by itself.
All that we see and conceive about
atom and motion only gives us phenomenal
relations and contingent results.
Beyond this is the absolute.
The observations and relations which
experience offers us may be fruitful
enough to render an account of the
facts, to extend and enlighten our knowledge,
to establish laws and attest actions.
But let us not grow tired in
repeating that these actions are not
produced alone, and that these laws
suppose an ordainer.</p>

<p>Especially when we endeavor to
understand the nature of life, atoms
and movement may come again into
play; but the cause increases and is
detached from the functions of beings;
and the superiority of the effects more
imperiously establishes the necessity
of an author.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The second theory admits only
forces in nature, and places in these
forces the principle of all that is produced.
It also goes up to the atom,
and considers it as equally indivisible
and imponderable. It attributes to
matter properties, so to speak, immanent
which give it its power and action.
Atoms, separated from each
other in the bodies which they compose,
and forming mere simple mathematical
points, possess, when they are
reunited in mass, a force of attraction
which acts at a distance, and
then reacts on them in order to produce
all the sensible phenomena.</p>

<p>Several <i>savants</i> and certain spiritualist
philosophers agree on this theory.
Both take facts as the starting
point in establishing their synthesis;
the former build it on a foundation
more exclusively physical; the latter
give to their generalization a more
philosophical basis.</p>

<p>M. Magy and M. Laugel, hardly
overstepping the limits of the experimental
world, follow the action of
forces into their different modes and
transformations.</p>

<p>M. Paul Janet, in his turn, delivers
his theory on matter.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is in fact," he writes, "force and not
extent which constitutes the essence of bodies;
an atom in motion occupies successively
places which it fits exactly. What
distinguishes this atom from the space previously
occupied by it? It is not the extent,
since in both cases the shape is the
same; every thing which relates to extent
is absolutely identical in the empty and in
the full atom. It is, therefore, something
else which distinguishes them, and this
something is solidity or weight; but neither
solidity nor weight is a modification of
extent; both are derived from force, and represent
it."</p></blockquote>

<p>M. Ch. LÃ©vÃªque adds:<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How do we make the extension which
we need? Always by resistance; when extension
is not a pure abstraction, when it is
real and concrete, it is always equivalent to
a sum of resisting points or forces. There
is no longer occasion to ask how, with unextended
elements, we may form extension.
There is but one question possible, and it is
this: How to form a sum of resistance with
resisting points?"</p></blockquote>

<p>This is what a learned Englishman,
P. Bayma, establishes with precision.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
According to him, the elements, or
atoms, are indivisible points without
material extent, and extension is not
an essential property of matter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The extension of bodies is an appearance
caused by the dissemination in space
of the elements which compose them; abstract
space is extension; consequently the
science of extension, or geometry, is not a
science of observation but of abstraction."</p></blockquote>

<p>According to this theory, the forces
placed from the beginning in elements
govern every thing in the world. Nature
is under their control; matter
obeys them, or is, rather, entirely a
compound of forces. One of the
partisans of this system<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> lays down
these conclusions: 1st, the last element
of matter is always an active,
simple, and indivisible force like the
soul itself; 2d, the properties of matter
are only manifestations of this
simple active force. Then, pushing
the consequences of this notion of
force further, he admits</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"that there is only one substance, material
and spiritual, at the same time; spiritual
in its elements, material in its composition.
The soul, conscious of its personal energy,
conceives physical beings as forces acting
like itself."</p></blockquote>

<p>A contemporary philosopher,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> developing
further the thesis of conciliation
and relation between the two
orders of existence, adds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Matter has at bottom no other substantial
element than spirit. The essence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>both is active force, consequently materialism
has no reason to exist; there is no longer
in nature any thing but spiritualism, or, to
speak more correctly, dynamism. This dynamism
has nothing which attacks the dignity
and preÃ«minence of the soul. The soul
alone is capable of thinking or willing, because
it alone is a simple force, whereas the
smallest body is a compound of simple
forces."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such are the theories which, according
to their supporters, are sustained
by the most recent discoveries of science.</p>

<p>As for us, we admit that from a
scientific stand-point there have been
many new and curious observations
collected; that the analysis of matter
has exposed to view the most astonishing
phenomena; that the material
element has been almost apprehended,
its depths investigated; that
it has been stripped of extension as
an essential property, its mode of action
and constituting principle discovered;
that it has been reduced to a
unity as sovereign as it is marvellous;
and we follow with the most lively
interest these results of disinterested
and impartial science. We go further;
according as the plan gains in
unity and grandeur, appearing at the
same time more imposing and probable,
it brings us nearer to Him who
has conceived it, who has given it order
and completion. The more of
mystery we discover in the universe,
the more we bow with admiration,
but without astonishment, before the
thought and will of the Sovereign
who is the origin and reason of the
existence of these wonders and of
their laws.</p>

<p>But our reason cannot go beyond
its limits, and the metaphysical consequences
which some have attempted
to draw from these phenomena,
we have not up to the present been
able to admit.</p>

<p>The theory which reduces all to
force, which recognizes in bodies an
intrinsic mode of acting, whether it
divide these forces in the mass of
matter, or cause them to mount up
to the primitive element, to the atom,
indivisible point, or monad, seems to
us in every case to beg the question.
What is in fact a force, and especially
a force attributed to any object?
It is undoubtedly neither a being,
since it is joined to a first element,
nor a substance, since it is considered
as an attribute. It is only a manner
of indicating an action, the cause
of which is unknown. To say that
matter acts because it bears in it the
power of acting, is simply to say that
it acts because it acts; to reply by asserting
the fact itself which is in question.
Therefore we have only one
of those words, new or old, which
may cause illusion for an instant, but
which do not stand a serious analysis.</p>

<p>Moreover, to attempt to compare
and assimilate matter and spirit by
giving to both the name of force, and
attributing to them the properties attached
to this name, is merely to
use a word without a definite meaning;
for if they were both forces, they
would be forces of entirely different,
if not opposite action. And if we
say that force, being half body and
half spirit, is the link which unites
them to each other, we create, merely
to suit our purpose, a third being
which is discovered nowhere, a mere
phantasmagoria without reality, which
the imagination itself is incapable of
representing to us.</p>

<p>Finally, in the parallel and assimilation
between body and soul, to reserve,
with the power of thinking, preÃ«minence
to the mind because it is a
simple and unique force, while the
smallest body is a compound of these
same simple forces, amounts to saying
that a body could think if it were
only decomposed and reduced to its
simple elements, and to the unity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
force. There is such a difference in
act, mode, and aim between what is
called the force of resistance, attributed
to bodies, and designated, we know
not why, by the name of active force,
and between the faculty of thinking,
that no common appellation, no matter
how specious it may be, can
ever confound or identify them.</p>

<p>We would not be able to comprehend
how the soul, considered as a
monad or simple element, should have
by this fact the faculty of thinking,
and yet two or several monads united
and forming a body would not
possess the same power. Why, in
the latter case, should there be absence
of thought instead of a union
of two or several thoughts, concordant
or contrary? How could we
say that, because there is an assemblage
of forces, there is an impossibility
of thinking, and that the part is
capable of doing what the whole cannot
do? It is useless to choose and
isolate the most delicate and ethereal
element in a body; we can never imagine
the soul to be really one of its
parts, no matter how pure that part
may be.</p>

<p>The notion of force, for the soul as
well as for the body, must be put
among those appellations which explain
nothing, and only serve to cloak
our ignorance.</p>

<p>Science itself begins to renounce
this name of force; and the first theory
which we have exposed, that which
recognizes only motions in matter
combats the theory of forces with
energy, and considers it as vain and
illusory. It is not here, consequently,
that we shall find the philosophical
explanation of phenomena, nor
the reconciliation between the two
orders of spirit and matter.</p>

<p>The theory of motions rests on a
more solid foundation; at least, it
employs a word having a precise signification
and resting on a real fact,
motion. It is only by induction and
reasoning that it ascends to ether and
the atom. It has never seen either
of them, although it affirms their existence.
It makes a synthesis. It
admits in the universe something else
besides atoms and movement, since
the thought which it expresses implies
the idea of being, of substance
and cause. It has seen motions, vibrations,
radiations, currents, and it
has concluded from them that there
is something which moves, vibrates,
radiates; thus it has mounted up to
a second cause, to ether, to the atom.
But this is not sufficient. If it has
seen that there is no motion without
an object which moves, logic compels
it to acknowledge that there is
no change without an agent, no
movement without a mover; and if
the atom exists and moves, this atom
also has an origin, a reason of being,
a principle from which it has received
the gift of existence and the power of
motion.</p>

<p>If an admirable plan embraces the
universe, if a sovereign unity directs
and governs all phenomena, there
must be a cause for them. The plan
appears more manifestly, and the
cause shows itself more necessarily in
the very simplicity of the work, in its
grandeur in this double quality raised
to a higher power.</p>

<p>If the world be, as it is acknowledged
to be, the work of thought; if
a general and supreme reason presides
over the universe, this thought
lives in a spirit, this reason belongs
to a soul.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Can there be a thought
without a thinking subject and being?
A thought implies a thinking being;
reason means a living intelligence;
or it must mean nothing, and then
there is no sense in words, no reality
in things.</p>

<p>It is useless to object; the human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>mind will have it so; it is the law of
its conscience, it is the result of its
profound conviction that it does not
derive all from itself, and that nothing
can produce nothing.</p>

<p>Now, can we say of the atom
and motion combined, behold the
universe? Yes, the mechanical universe,
perhaps. But the mechanical
universe is not self-sufficing; for we
can always say, Who has made the
atom? who has created motion?
And then we have the right to propose
another affirmation and to conclude:
the notion of causality is the
entire world&mdash;the physical, intellectual,
and moral world.</p>

<p>This has been true from the very
beginning of thought and the commencement
of human reason. This
has been true from the days of ancient
philosophy, proclaiming through
its greatest logician that whatever is
in the effect ought to be found in the
cause, that the cause must really exist
before the effect, and that the perfection
of all effects supposes the existence
of a primary cause which contains
them&mdash;a living, spiritual, and
perfect cause, which cannot be produced
by what is imperfect, inferior,
material, or deprived of life, but which
is and must be necessarily its generating
principle and producing power.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Thus the two systems of motions
and of forces, brought before the metaphysical
world, for they call themselves
syntheses, fall short of the
mark and do not reach the true principle.
The one assigns no cause for
the elements and phenomena which
it represents. The other attributes
to these same elements and phenomena,
a word and a name which cannot
be a cause. The former does
not give, and does not pretend to
give, a real explanation. The latter
formulates an explanation, but presents
nothing satisfactory.</p>

<p>It appears, however, that all the
tendencies of modern science are toward
the idea of unity in the universal
system, toward a simplification
and spiritualization in the plan; and
the belief of some goes so far as to
admit that this plan offers parallel
lines more or less similar in both the
material and the spiritual world. But
here again the rock rises and the
danger appears. In making bodies
so like spirits, we run the risk of making
the spiritual too much like the
material, and, in both cases, by such
confusion we almost touch on pantheism,
the theory of which, consisting
in the admission of but one substance,
is equally dangerous whether
this one substance be material or spiritual.
We will allow matter, therefore,
to raise itself toward unity, purify itself
more and more, and disentangle its essence
from its innumerable and marvellous
combinations, provided that it
be admitted that it possesses a real existence,
that it is really matter, that it
can never become spirit or thought,
and that it is not its own force or
cause or reason of being. What
would be gained for it from a spiritualist
point of view, to admit in matter
an immediate power, to clothe it
with intrinsic qualities which nothing
either in ideas or facts manifests or
demonstrates? No problem would
be solved thereby, no mystery cleared
up; it would be necessary to establish
why and how the same substance,
at the same time and alternately,
feels and does not feel, wills
and is inert, thinks and is devoid of
intelligence, is immovable in the
stone, awakes in the plant, and is
organic in the animal, and finally
creates and vivifies the genius of
man.</p>

<p>There must be logic in the assertion
that the essence of matter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
found in an atom or in a force, that
it is inactive or endowed with movement,
that there is in bodies unity
or variety of substance, that the different
kingdoms are united by greater
affinities or separated by more marked
distinctions; these properties, comparisons,
and differences must have
their logic and their reason of being,
and do not derive the laws which
govern them from a spontaneous or
fortuitous formation.</p>

<p>Nothing, consequently, in the secondary
explanations which are given
to us, can satisfy our metaphysical
wants. The mind of man will never
stop at the mere properties of things
or their effects. Its instinct of causality
does not accept incomplete
theories and theses which do not
sound the depths. Casting aside all
idea of confusion and of inexact comparison,
the human mind wishes to
rise higher; it wishes, in its admiration
for order and the harmony of
phenomena, to ascend to the very
summit of being. Yes, it admits
and recognizes the fact that every
thing which exists has a single and
sovereign cause, and this cause is
itself the most spiritual of spiritual
substances&mdash;God the creator and ordainer
of worlds. Author of all
things, God causes with the qualities
which belong to him the different
manifestations of nature; he acts on
matter, possesses it, causes it to subsist,
gives it the power of producing
its phenomena, is its force, its order,
its law; and thus, if we may say so, he
animates the world, not indeed in the
same manner as the human soul animates
the body, because we cannot
compare essences and actions so unlike
each other, but with a certain
superior and divine power of animation
which produces the being, motion,
and life of all that exists in the
universe, moves or breathes, as the
soul is the source and focus of the life
of the body.</p>

<p>To destroy this supreme cause is
to degrade at the same time the material
and the intellectual world; it
is to renounce the notion of perfection
and of the absolute; it is to condemn,
together with one of the mother-ideas,
one of the axioms of the
human mind, that logic which can
never see aught complete or satisfactory
in mere effects or phenomena;
it is to attack one of the most beautiful
faculties of the intelligence, of
that intelligence which the contingent
cannot content, which will not allow
itself to be restrained by the mere
limits of time and space, which, from
the present which it studies, from
facts which it investigates, and peculiarities
which it admires, ascends to
the infinite, to the all-powerful, to the
Eternal.</p>

<p>Thus we consider that the most
recent discoveries of science, in their
rational and superior interpretation,
lead us naturally to God, and we
have at the same time the belief and
the hope that materialism will be involuntarily
stricken down, and will
perish perhaps by the very hands of
those who study and search after
matter alone.</p>

<p>No doubt the considerations which
might be actually drawn from the results
obtained do not lead to definite
theories nor do they offer any thing
but premature conclusions. The majority
of the <i>savants</i>, moreover, properly
refuse to touch on the domain
of the supernatural and metaphysical;
they confine themselves to facts;
some so veil their opinions and philosophical
doctrines as even to cause
us to doubt whether they follow the
standard of spiritualism or of materialism.
They do not arrogate to
themselves either the right or the
power of drawing conclusions; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
the synthesis which results from their
experiments can only be a premature
conjecture, more or less plausible.</p>

<p>But since their researches already
give occasion to perceptions so simple
and so grand, since they open
horizons in the distance where light
certainly exists, since there is from
the stand-point of truth a serene and
unalterable confidence in the final
and definite results of modern discoveries,
we may be permitted even
now to describe them for the elevation
and the encouragement of the
mind, for the justification and the
honor of human science, for the revindication
of the grandeur and of
the glory of God.</p>

<h2>NAZARETH.</h2>


<p>After a residence of two months
in the holy city of Jerusalem, the
writer of this sketch left the shrines of
the Cross and the Tomb to visit the
sacred localities of Palestine. Going
northward, and passing by Jacob's
well and Samaria, our party came to
Jenin, on the borders of the plain of
EsdrÃ¦lon, where we encamped for
the night; and on the next day, which
was Thursday, April 5th, 1866, went
to Jezreel, to the great fountain which
springs from the base of the mountain
of Gilboa, on which Saul and Jonathan
were slain; then passed through
Nain, where our Lord raised the
widow's son, and Endor. Leaving
Mount Thabor on our right, we came
to the foot of the steep hill on the
other side of which is Nazareth. After
a wearisome ascent, in the middle of
the afternoon, we saw the city of the
annunciation at our feet.</p>

<p>Nazareth is in a valley about one
mile long, running east and west, and
only a quarter of a mile wide. Fifteen
hills inclose this small space. The
whole of this valley, not occupied by
the houses, is filled with gardens, corn-fields,
and small groves of olive and
fig-trees. The houses are irregularly
placed, and are evidently more comfortable
than many others in the Holy
Land. Being all constructed of white
stone, they have a substantial appearance.
But the streets cannot be
praised. Irregular in their course,
they are the filthiest we had anywhere
seen. This wretched condition of the
streets is the more noticeable because
the people are superior to other dwellers
in the land, and apparently more
intelligent, well-fed, and housed. Several
buildings were in the course of
erection; and it seemed that the village
was prospering. The houses
stand on the lower slope of a hill about
four hundred feet high, and on the
adjacent ridges. About four thousand
people make up the population, all
Christians except seven hundred Mohammedans.
Of the Christians, the
schismatic Greeks number about one
thousand, and the Roman Catholics
and Greek Catholics have each about
five hundred persons. There is an
air of independence and relative comfort
about all the people here which
contrasts with the sad and desponding
manners of the residents in other
eastern places. Wherever Turks rule,
cheerfulness is unknown.</p>

<p>On entering Nazareth, we rode to the
further end of the village, and encamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
in a pleasant spot quite near the
fountain of the Virgin, a place to
which all travellers who remain in
their tents resort, as it is usual to encamp
in the vicinity of water. Besides
this, the fountain is the best place
to see the people of the village, it being
the common place of resort, especially
for women. This spring is
the only one in the place; and for
that reason it has many visitors.
From early dawn until late in the
afternoon, women of every age come
here with jars or pitchers on their
heads or shoulders. The streams of
water are not copious, and there is
often delay in obtaining the supply,
especially in seasons of drought. While
waiting here to fill their jars, the women
gossip and chat, and thus each
one hears the news of the day. Women
of every rank go to the fountain
for water&mdash;partly that they may not
appear to be above their neighbors,
and partly, it may be surmised, to hear
what is going on. Little girls are
trained to carry the water-jar on the
head&mdash;for them, of course, the jar is
small&mdash;and every person has a small
pad or cushion on her head to support
the jar and prevent injury. From this
habit of so bearing these jars, all the
women of Nazareth are straight and
erect in their carriage, and have much
grace and dignity of motion. Not
only are they finely formed, but their
faces are the most beautiful in Palestine;
and there is a pleasing tradition
that the Blessed Virgin Mary left the
gift of beauty to the women of her city.
Their dress is also graceful, consisting
of large, short trowsers, a close-fitting
jacket, and a long white veil which
does not cover the face. For ornament
they use a string of silver and
gold coins around the head and chin,
many of which are very heavy and
valuable&mdash;uncomfortable decorations
at the best, but showing the dowry
of the wearer.</p>

<p>I thought that the water of the
fountain of Nazareth was the best I
had ever tasted; perhaps this was
fancy, but certainly the water is most
pure and excellent, and is renowned
for those qualities. To this fountain,
without doubt, the Blessed Virgin
came hundreds of times, being trained
like other children to bear the
water-jar from early years. Here she
talked with her neighbors, and lived
in a manner undistinguished from other
poor girls. And whoever will go to-day
to that fountain in Nazareth, or
to the one near the shrine of the
Visitation in the hills of Judea, will
see young women looking just as
Mary did eighteen hundred years
ago; for habits of life and dress have
scarcely changed in the east during
that long time. The water at Nazareth
rises about eight or ten rods from
the place where it is poured into the
jars, being conveyed to the latter place
in an aqueduct; and the schismatic
Greek Christians have built a church
at the spot where it issues from the
ground, on account of an old tradition
that the annunciation took place
at the spring when the Blessed Virgin
went there for water. There is this
great advantage resulting from the
error of the Greeks, that, on account
of their belief in it, they leave the
spot where the annunciation really
took place in the quiet possession of
the Catholics, the Franciscan monks
being the custodians of the shrine.</p>

<p>Now let us walk to the most holy
place, which is at the other end of the
village, and some distance from our
tents. The premises are extensive,
and consist of large buildings, surrounded
by a high wall. Passing
through the gate, we come to a court,
around which are the school-rooms,
the pharmacy, the quarters of the superior
and other monks; from this
larger area we go to a smaller one
immediately in front of the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
The church itself is about seventy
feet square, and the roof is supported
by four very heavy piers or square
columns. These piers, and much of
the walls, are covered with tapestry
hangings, with embroidery and paintings;
and the whole edifice, though
not very large, has a fine, rich, and
cheerful appearance, as if arranged
for a perpetual festival. As we enter
the church, immediately before us is
a flight of fifteen very broad steps,
leading down to the shrine. At the
foot of these stairs is a vestibule,
about twenty-five feet long by ten
wide, and a low arch, opening in the
middle of this space, admits to the
holy place. There is a marble altar,
and under the altar is a marble slab,
four inches above the floor; it has the
Jerusalem cross in the centre, with
the Franciscan coat of arms on the
right, and the sacred stigmata, or five
wounds of the crucified Saviour, on
the left. This marble marks the spot
where the Blessed Virgin stood at the
time of the annunciation. On the
back wall, under the altar, is the inscription,
"<span class="smcap">Verbum caro hic factum
est</span>," (<i>Here the Word was made flesh</i>,)
the most wonderful and important
inscription in the world. That at
Bethlehem, where it is written that
"<span class="smcap">Here, of the Virgin Mary, Jesus
Christ was born</span>," could never
have been engraved but for the event
commemorated in the words of the
shrine at Nazareth. Above the altar
is a picture well painted and old, but
spoiled by the flat gold crowns which
have been fastened to the canvas
over the heads of the Blessed Virgin
and the angel. Below the table of
the altar, and over the marble slab,
hang several silver lamps which burn
continually. Immediately behind this
altar and picture are another altar
and picture, back to back with those
of the shrine. The second altar has
the inscription, "<span class="smcap">Hic erat subditus
illis</span>," (<i>Here He was subject to them</i>.)
Behind these, and reached by a narrow
rock-hewn stairway, is the kitchen
of the Blessed Virgin, where the
fireplace and chimney are shown.</p>

<p>As we come into the church by the
chief entrance, a most cheerful and
pleasant scene welcomes the pilgrim.
The gay decorations, the many paintings,
the statues and silver lamps,
with other objects, make a contrast
with the dreariness of the ride to Nazareth,
which seems to the Christian
like a glimpse of heaven. He raises
his eyes, and sees the choir where the
Franciscan monks chant their office.
Here is an altar with a large statue
of the Blessed Virgin and the Infant
Jesus, surmounted by a canopy.
There are two large organs in the choir,
one at the right, the other at the left.
This choir is raised about sixteen
steps above the floor of the church,
and is immediately over the most
holy place, of which it may be said
to form the roof. As the shrine is
about fifteen steps below the level of
the church floor, the distance between
the spot of the annunciation and the
choir above it is about thirty steps.
It gives the idea of three churches&mdash;the
first being the main building,
the second that of the holy place,
which is below, and the third that of
the monks' choir, which is immediately
over the shrine. As we look down
the broad stair which leads to the
shrine, we see that the walls are cased
with marble and adorned with
paintings. Before us is the holy place,
to which the eye is at once drawn;
but before we reach it, in the vestibule,
on the right and left hand, stand
beautiful marble altars, each with a
painting over it. In the whole arrangement
there is a dignity and propriety
which strike the pilgrim most
favorably, and he recognizes it as
planned by men who had a vivid realization
of the event which is the glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
of Nazareth. To the left of the altar
of the shrine is the upper two thirds
of a large granite column suspended
from the roof, with a fragment of a
marble column under it; though these
are both of dark stone, and of nearly
the same color and size, it is easy
to note the difference in the material
of which they are composed.</p>

<p>It was on Friday, April 6th, that I
first said mass at the shrine of the annunciation.
The interest of this spot
is very great, even when compared
with other places in Palestine; and I
had looked forward, with great hope
and expectation, to the day when I
would be permitted to kneel and pray
here. At last my wish was realized,
and I offered the holy sacrifice on
the very spot where the incarnation
of God took place. By a concession
of the holy see, the mass of the annunciation
may be said on this altar
nearly every day in the year; so that
the pilgrim, coming at any season
may have the consolation of being present
at the same mass as is said on
the 25th of March. Of course, every
priest avails himself with eagerness
of this privilege; and no words can
express the emotion of his soul as,
when reading the last gospel, in
speaking the words <span class="smcap">et Verbum caro
factum est</span>, he kneels down on the
very spot where that mystery took
place, where the incarnation of God
began. For it was to Nazareth that
God sent his holy Archangel Gabriel:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
was Joseph, of the house of David; and the
virgin's name was Mary. And the angel
being come in, said to her, Hail, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou
among women. And when she had heard,
she was troubled at his saying, and thought
with herself what manner of salutation this
should be. And the angel said to her,
Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace
with God. Behold, thou shalt conceive in
thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son: and
thou shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be
great, and shall be called the Son of the
Most High: and the Lord God shall give
unto him the throne of David his father; and
he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever;
and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
And Mary said to the angel, How shall
this be done, because I know not man? And
the angel answering, said to her: The Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power
of the Most High shall overshadow thee;
and therefore also the Holy which shall be
born of thee, shall be called the Son of
God.... And Mary said, Behold the
handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according
to thy word. (St. Luke i.)</p>

<p>And the Word was made flesh and dwelt
among us." (St. John i.)</p></blockquote>

<p>After having prayed a long time,
prostrate at the shrine, I sat down
at the side of the broad flight of steps
leading to the holy place, and meditated
for an hour. Before me was
the spot where all these things occurred,
and where man's redemption was
begun. It was easy to go back one
thousand eight hundred years, and
picture the scene. The lowly maiden
in her humble home, engaged, it may
have been, in the ordinary occupations
of the day, or perchance resting
for a time from them, and meditating
on God, when suddenly the room
was filled with light, and the angel appeared
and delivered his august message.
Then in the house which
once stood here the child Jesus lived,
and grew in favor with God and man.
He ran about the humble but sacred
home in his boyhood, and wandered
among the hills that are so close
around Nazareth. Many a time did
he go with Mary to the fountain when
she brought water for the use of the
family. By her side he kept in his
early years, as children are wont to
cling to their mothers. When he had
grown older, he helped Joseph in the
work of carpentry, and went with him
as he journeyed to the various places
where he found work. No doubt
the employment was humble, the
tools rude and few; and it is reasonable
to suppose that such work as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
humble carpenter might find among
poor villagers or fishermen at the Lake
of Tiberias was not of the most elegant
and costly kind. Even to this
day there is great simplicity and rudeness
in all the mechanic arts, which
is noticed by the traveller, and it
must have been equally so in the
country places in the days of our Saviour.</p>

<p>Thus for thirty years did Jesus dwell
in Nazareth, undistinguished from
others by any external appearance,
and leading a hidden life of contemplation
and communing with his heavenly
Father.</p>

<p>When his ministry had begun, after
his baptism in the Jordan and his
temptation of forty days in the wilderness,
he came to Nazareth, and went
into the synagogue, according to his
custom, and read out of the book
which was handed to him the words
of Isaias,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The spirit of the Lord is upon me;
wherefore he hath anointed me to preach
the Gospel to the poor. He hath sent me
to heal the contrite of heart, to preach deliverance
to the captives, and sight to the
blind; to set at liberty them that are bruised,
to preach the acceptable year of the Lord,
and the day of reward. And he began to
say to them, This day is fulfilled this Scripture
in your ears."</p></blockquote>

<p>When they had rejected his teaching,
he went to Capernaum, on the
borders of the Sea of Galilee, fifteen
miles east from Nazareth, and the
people there were astonished at his
doctrine and the miracles which he
performed. Subsequently he visited
Nazareth a second time, and was
taunted by the people of the place,
who regarded him as only one of their
neighbors. They said, "Is not this
the carpenter, the son of Mary, the
brother of James and Joseph, and of
Jude and Simon? are not also his
sisters here with us? And they were
scandalized in regard of him." The
greater portion of our Lord's life,
during the three following years, was
passed in the neighborhood of the
Lake of Tiberias, or near Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Nazareth has one or two other
places of interest, yet they are of small
note in comparison of the shrine of
the annunciation. One of these is
the place where stood the workshop
of Joseph; a chapel is built here.
Another is the rock called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mensa
Christi</i>, or Table of Christ, which is
venerated as the place where our Lord
often ate his food. It projects three
feet above the ground, and is about
twelve feet long and eight feet wide.
A new church is over it.</p>

<p>The hill back of Nazareth is always
ascended by travellers for the sake of
the fine view which may be had there.
The whole country for miles around
is visible&mdash;Mount Hermon, Mount
Carmel, the Mediterranean Sea, and
the great plain of EsdrÃ¦lon. Just
around Nazareth the hills are rather
bare; but everywhere else they are
wooded, and sink down into green
valleys. We see how the city lies
off all the great routes of travel in
former days, and is shut up by the
hills, and thus <i>separated</i> (as the name
Nazareth implies) from other places.
Its isolated position, and the resulting
obscurity, is the reason why it was
unknown to ancient writers, and there
is no mention made of it in the Old
Testament. From the Gospel narrative
we learn that the contemptuous
inquiry was made "Can any good
thing come out of Nazareth?" To
this the Christian answers from the
depth of his soul, Yes! all good
cometh thence. The Child of Nazareth
has passed from obscurity and a
hidden life to a prominence which no
description can adequately portray.
He who was conceived of the Virgin
Mary in this little village is our Lord
and our God, and in him centre all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
our hopes. He who condescended
to be subject to Mary and Joseph in
Nazareth, is the King of kings and
Lord of lords, and now and for ever
reigneth in the heaven which is his
home.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />

PASTIMES AND PARTINGS.</h3>

<p>In accordance with the teacher's
announcement, the day following Michael's
return was given up to rejoicings,
and Mr. Blair invited the school
to pass it at his place.</p>

<p>It was one of those golden days
not so frequent in our autumnal season
as to lose the charm of novelty,
or the full sense of their value in redeeming
its general sternness; and it
seemed to the boys as if nature herself
shared in the universal delight.
The spacious ground encircling Mr.
Blair's residence afforded ample scope
for their pastimes, and their dinner
was served under the trees in the yard.</p>

<p>To those who had known Michael
Hennessy only as the thoughtless, frolicsome
boy, it did not seem possible
that a few short weeks could have
wrought the change now apparent in
him. The fiery trial through which
he had passed accomplished the work
of time upon his character, and he
emerged from it purified and matured.</p>

<p>His face still wore the sunny smile
that had made it a joy to all, but the
light which lingered upon it was chastened
and subdued. His manners
still charmed by the warm, ingenuous
frankness that made him the village
pet, but their former reckless gayety
was sobered by the spirit of piety,
which had established its abode within
his youthful heart from the moment
when the blessed hand of adversity
opened wide its portals, and prepared
it to become thenceforth a
chosen home of the celestial guest.</p>

<p>He was more than ever the favorite
of the boys, and the leader in all
their sports; but his devotion to study
was more faithful, his attention to
every religious duty more regular,
and his conduct under all circumstances
more exemplary than ever before.</p>

<p>Soon after his return, farmer Brown
celebrated the event by inviting the
school&mdash;without any exceptions this
time&mdash;to spend another day at the
farm, as the season for gathering nuts
had arrived. Such a gay time as they
had! whisking the deep beds of fallen
leaves about in search for hidden
treasures, and watching the squirrels
gleaning in the path from which they
had thrown off nature's covering for
stray nuts, whose hiding places had
thus been revealed.</p>

<p>The day passed delightfully, but
not, like their former holidays, in unalloyed
and careless pleasure. The
thought would intrude upon its happiest
moments, that their little band
was soon to be broken up, and that this
was to be the last occasion upon
which they would all meet in the hey-day
of boyish glee, to join in boyish
pastimes.</p>

<p>For the change was now stealing
upon them apace which presses
closely on the footsteps of boyhood&mdash;and
from which our "young Vermonters"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
were not to be exempted&mdash;when
one and another must pass from
its arena, to enter upon a new stage
of action and form new associations.
When the dear old school-house,
with all the memories that were to
link it with the shifting scenes of each
single life&mdash;to which it had been the
starting-point in quest of knowledge&mdash;was
to be exchanged for college halls,
the office, the counter, or the farm,
with all their excitements, laborious
duties, and temptations, and their
weary anxieties.</p>

<p>The next week after their visit to
the farm, Frank Blair took his leave
of home and friends to enter the naval
school at B&mdash;&mdash;. Not long after,
George Wingate, Henry Howe, and
Johnny Hart entered the College of
the Holy Cross. The same week, Patrick
Casey was appointed clerk in a railroad
office, and Dennis Sullivan left
to take his place as clerk in a wholesale
establishment in Boston.</p>

<p>Who shall say what pangs all these
changes, so easily related, and so
much a matter of course in this
changeful world, cost the young exiles
now banished from the sheltering
bosom of home, and standing for the
first time face to face with the stern
realities of life? The homesick looking
back to the dear and peaceful
past, the timid, shrinking glances into
the dim vista of the dreaded future&mdash;the
one bathed in all the effulgence
of morning, the other bearing already
upon its sombre wings foreshadowings
of the night!</p>

<p>And who shall describe the loneliness
of each home from which the
brightest, warmest ray of sunshine had
been stricken, when the school-boy
with his "shining morning face" vanished
from its precincts, to return no
more for ever with the light of his
young life upon his brow?</p>

<p>None but mothers can know the
depth of the shadow that remains to
them in the place of their mirthful
boys. But take courage, ye mothers!
Rest not in supine regrets and gentle
memories, but betake yourselves with
renewed energy and diligence to the
use of the all-conquering weapon of
prayer, for now more than ever do
your darlings need its aid. Remember
what the holy bishop said to the
afflicted St. Monica in the olden time,
"It cannot be that the child of so
many tears should perish." Let your
sons, in the midst of their temptations
and trials, be shielded and sustained
by the firm assurance that their mothers
are constantly lifting up pure
hands and fervent hearts to heaven
in their behalf. So, following the
example of that saintly mother, may
you hope to gain that mother's reward.
For it is true now as it was
then, and will be unto the end of
time, that, "They who sow in tears
shall reap in joy!"</p>

<p>Michael remained at home, pursuing
his studies diligently until the
winter was far advanced, when his
father was taken alarmingly ill, and
he was obliged to relinquish them
and devote himself to his care, and
that of the family. He had long
known that some trouble was weighing
upon his father, and he was now
made acquainted with it.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hennessy first came to
M&mdash;&mdash;, he rented a very pretty place
just out of the village, to which they
became so much attached that he
finally purchased it, and had from time
to time been able to make improvements
and add little embellishments
within and around the premises, besides
meeting the payments as they
fell due. Latterly, with failing health
and an increasing family, he had been
unable to do more than support his
household comfortably, and two payments
remained to be met; they were
now both due, and his creditor threatened
to foreclose the mortgage upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
the place, if they were not promptly
paid.</p>

<p>Michael was deeply distressed when
the state of their affairs was made
known to him. The thought of losing
their all, and the home they so
dearly loved, the scene of so many
tranquil joys, weighed heavily upon
his young heart. He sought in fervent
prayer the refuge of the Catholic,
commending himself and all his dear
ones anew to the protection of the
Blessed Virgin Mother, and leaving
all his troubles at her feet. Suddenly
it flashed upon his remembrance
that Mr. Blair had told him if he
should ever need assistance or advice
not to fail of applying to him, and
that he should consider it a favor if
he would do so. To him, therefore,
he resolved to go at once, though it
was not without much of the old apprehension
of his sternness that he
sought the office of that gentleman,
mingled with uprisings of a pride that
rebelled against asking favors from one
who had formerly despised his people.
For duty's sake, however, he mastered
all these feelings, and was received
with the utmost kindness. With a faltering
voice he laid the whole case
open to Mr. Blair, and concluded by
saying, "Now, sir, you see the sum
due on the place is not a large one,
and if you feel disposed to advance it,
I will guarantee the payment of interest
and principal as soon as I can
leave my father and get into a situation
to earn it."</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do?" said
Mr. Blair.</p>

<p>"I must seek a place as book-keeper
or clerk in some establishment; and
will do so without delay."</p>

<p>"Do you prefer such a position to
any other?" inquired his friend.</p>

<p>"I have," said Michael, blushing
with bashful earnestness, "always indulged
the hope that I might be able
to study law; but this must now be
relinquished," he added after a slight
pause.</p>

<p>"Well, my young friend," said Mr.
Blair kindly, "I will now tell you
what I think had better be done. I
will raise this money for you, and you
may take your own time to pay it.
I have no fears on that score. I will
see that matters in relation to the
home are put upon a safe footing without
delay. You will take care of
your father and the family until he is
sufficiently recovered to spare you,
and then you will enter my office as
a student. I have felt very lonely since
Frank went away, and will be pleased
to have his best friend with me. Besides,
you are an excellent and rapid
penman; I need such a one in my business
just now very much, and can afford
to pay you liberally for your
assistance. My old hands are getting
too stiff to write much, and my
business is increasing. If this proposal
suits you, consider the matter
settled for the present."</p>

<p>It need not be told how thankfully
Michael accepted the offer, nor what
fervent thanksgivings were poured
from pious hearts in that home when
the arrangement was made known.</p>

<p>Mr. Hennessy recovered rapidly
when the pressure of adverse circumstances
and the fears of impending
calamity were removed; and Michael
soon entered Mr. Blair's office as a
student. Here his close attention to
business, his application to study, and
his fidelity to every duty, gained for
him the highest esteem and confidence
of his superior, who would often exclaim
to himself, "Oh! why could not
my boy have been such a one as this?
With every obstacle removed from his
path and every encouragement offered,
why would he persist in casting all his
advantages aside, to pursue a reckless
career of folly?"</p>

<p>And indeed he heard little that was
encouraging from Frank in his new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
position. He was so homesick, discontented,
and dissatisfied with everything
as to unfit him for the studies
and duties of the school, the discipline
and restraints of which were insupportably
irksome to him. But his
father was only convinced that they
were remedies the more necessary to
a restless spirit which chafed so fiercely
under them. His passion for mischief
and fun continually drew the
chains he hated more closely around
him, and involved him daily in new
difficulties. One circumstance alone&mdash;humanly
speaking&mdash;prevented him
from falling into utter ruin. He had
formed an enthusiastic friendship for
his sister Fanny's dearest friend, the
eldest daughter of Mrs. Plimpton,
Julia Plimpton&mdash;one of those gentle,
lovely girls, who wield a controlling
influence over such impetuous, restless
characters. He was in correspondence
with her, and to her he communicated
all his troubles and his
peevish, fretful repinings, in perfect
confidence, receiving just the advice
he needed from time to time to keep
him from breaking rudely away from
all restraint.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />

DEVELOPMENTS.</h3>

<p>Two years elapsed without any
material changes in the circle to which
this narrative relates.</p>

<p>During this period, Miss Carlton,
one of Miss Blair's best friends, near
her own age, and a lady of intelligence
and wealth, with strong philanthropic
impulses, had set herself with great
enthusiasm to gather a large number
of poor French Catholic children, who
would not attend the public schools,
into a sort of boarding-school at her
own cottage on the confines of the
village. She solicited aid from Miss
Blair in dressing her young wards
suitably, and entered zealously into
the task of educating them, as a necessary
prelude to their conversion to
Protestantism, which must inevitably
follow. Miss Blair willingly assisted
her with funds, and the use of her
needle in preparing clothing; but could
not be persuaded to go any further.
Miss Carlton at length becoming vexed
and irritated by the cool scepticism
with which her efforts were regarded,
insisted on knowing the reason.</p>

<p>"I am sure it is not want of benevolence,"
said she; "for I have
known you too long and too well to
doubt the kindness of your heart.
Do tell me, then, why you will persist
in looking upon my exertions with so
much apathy?"</p>

<p>"Precisely because," said Miss Blair,
laughing, "I once tried the experiment
myself, under as much more promising
auspices as the superior numbers
and greater necessities of that class
of children in a city could furnish.
My failure was more grand than yours
will be, because my operations were
on a grander scale."</p>

<p>"But why must I of necessity fail?"</p>

<p>"Ah! there lies the mystery. I
cannot tell you why; nor do I deny
but you may benefit them so far as
learning to read and write, and even
some little smattering of further knowledge
may go; but make Protestants
of them? Never! When you think
you have secured them by catching
the unfledged brood and attaching
them to the Protestant cage by food
and favors, just one chirp from the
mother-bird, and <i>Presto!</i> your flock
is gone! If you will take the pains
to follow, you will find them nestled
under the parent wing and peeping
out at you so contentedly and complacently!
I know, for I have tried
it; and am forced to laugh now when
I think how provoked I was, and how
puzzled to account for the mysterious,
irrepressible, and apparently irresistible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
power that majestic mother exercised.
Since I came to this part of Vermont,
my conviction of the futility of all
such attempts has been confirmed.
There have been great rejoicings
among the Methodists and Baptists,
at one time and another, over accessions
to their numbers from the
ancient ark; but let a priest appear
in those localities and utter the rallying
call of their church&mdash;away scamper
the converts, and their Protestant
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrÃ¨res</i> have seen the last of them!"</p>

<p>As Mrs. Blair had intimated during
the colloquy with Mrs. Plimpton, her
sister-in-law had become interested in
the converts of M&mdash;&mdash; and in reading
their books. She began listlessly, from
a mere willingness to hear what could
be said on that side, and to see fair
play, perhaps unconsciously hoping
to find some solution for that "mysterious
power" which so puzzled her. But
the investigation thus indolently opened
soon awakened new ideas as to
the importance of issues which involved
eternity. From that moment nothing
could exceed the fervent energy
with which she followed up the subject,
determined to know and follow
the truth, if it was to be found on earth.
Her labors resulted as all such labors
honestly entered upon, diligently pursued,
and governed by the spirit of
justice, must inevitably result. She
found herself safely sheltered under
the wings of the gentle mother whose
loving attractions had formerly astonished
her ignorance. Her brother
made no comments, but poor Mrs.
Blair was utterly disgusted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her favorite niece&mdash;because
Frank's favorite and petted sister&mdash;Fanny
was drawn by casually
looking into the books which her aunt
was studying so closely to take a
lively interest in the same subject.
But the reading of "prosy books of
controversy," as she called them, was
an effort quite beyond her patience,
so she would seek the office occasionally
and question Michael. He declined,
as far as he could in conscience, to
assist her in the matter, thinking that
to do so would be in some sort a
breach of the confidence reposed in
him by her father.</p>

<p>At length one day, when he had
been even more provokingly indifferent
than usual, and pursued his writing
diligently despite her questioning,
she exclaimed,</p>

<p>"I never did see such a vexatious
fellow as you are! I can't imagine
what Frank could have seen in you
to like so well. One might just as
well talk to a stick; there's nothing
interesting or sociable about you! I
suppose you think you're going to
keep me from being a Catholic by
your hateful ways; but you won't, I
can tell you. I can <em>read</em>, if you
won't talk, only I <em>do</em> hate the trouble."
And she departed, leaving him
amused beyond measure at her vehemence.</p>

<p>She was engaged in a correspondence
with Julia Plimpton, of the
frequent and confidential nature in
which girls of that age are wont to
indulge, and of course opened her
heart to her friend upon the subject
which now most interested her. Their
letters were soon filled with the discussion
of religious questions, in which
after a time Mrs. Plimpton joined, expressing
her surprise that so much
could be said in favor of a creed
which she had always regarded as
the height of absurdity, and the last
stronghold of bigotry, superstition,
and ignorance, in this progressive
age.</p>

<p>At the stage of our narrative upon
which this chapter opens, Mr. Hennessy
was one day looking over the
columns of the Boston <cite>Pilot</cite>&mdash;to
which Mr. Sullivan was a subscriber&mdash;when
his eye fell upon the following
paragraph:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If Patrick Hennessy or any of his family,
who landed in Boston from the ship
Hibernia in the summer of 18&mdash;, will call
at the <cite>Pilot</cite> office, they will hear something
greatly to their advantage."</p></blockquote>

<p>After consulting with Mrs. Hennessy,
Michael, and Mr. Blair, he decided
to start for Boston without delay.</p>

<p>The editor of the <cite>Pilot</cite>, when found,
asked him many questions as to his
place of residence in Ireland, the
name of his wife, of the priest who
married them, of his other family
connections, and where he had lived
since he came to America; all which
being satisfactorily answered, the following
letter was put into his hands
to read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, Sept. 8, 18&mdash;.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To the Editor of the Boston Pilot</span>:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: When I was on board the
Golden City, bound for this place early
in the summer of 18&mdash;, the sailor on the
'look-out' discovered an object floating
at some distance astern, and notified the
captain, who ordered the boat manned to
overhaul it. The object proved to be a
man lashed to a table and apparently
dead. They brought him to the vessel,
where, after a time, he began to show signs
of life, and in a few hours was able to give
an account of himself. The Polar Queen,
on which he was a passenger, was struck
by an iceberg in the night. At the first
shock he secured himself firmly to the table
and sprang overboard; after which he remembered
nothing, and could give no idea
how long it was since the event, but supposed
the vessel went down with all on
board, as she was badly shivered and rapidly
filling the last he knew of her.</p>

<p>"His name was Michael Hennessy, and
he was a tradesman like myself, and from
the same county at home. He had a brother
Patrick, who was to sail for America
the same year. The two brothers married
two sisters, by name Mary and Bridget
Denver, the year before. Michael married
Bridget. They had no children when Michael
left home. There was great call for
work at our trades in San Francisco, and
Michael came on here with me. As soon
as we reached this place, he wrote home to
the parish priest, Father O'Reilly, to have
Patrick come to California, sending money
which I loaned him. He received answer
that his brother, with their two wives and
Patrick's new-born infant, left soon after
he did on the Hibernia, bound for Boston.
He then applied to you, as you may remember,
to get information of them, if you could.
In due course you informed him that the
Hibernia arrived safely at Boston; that
you found the people with whom they stopped,
who stated that Michael's wife and
child died during a severe storm on the voyage
out; that Patrick stopped in Boston
until he heard of the loss of the Polar
Queen with all on board, when he started
for the western country, and they had heard
nothing from him since.</p>

<p>"Michael then sent notices to papers in
all the western cities, but could get no tidings
from his brother. We continued to
work at our trades, and the master builder
who employed us, owning a deal of land near
the city, paid us in city lots, on which we
built houses, to rent according as we could,
when work was scant. Rents were very
high, for there was a great rush to the city,
and buildings scarce, and the city lots went
up in a way that would astonish the world.
So Mike and I found ourselves rich of a
sudden; but he always uneasy about his
brother. At last, when he could stand the
heavy heart no longer, he determined to go
in search of him. In case any thing might
happen him on his travels, he executed papers
leaving all he had with me in trust for
his brother or family, should they ever be
found. Just when he was ready to start, he
took sick of a fever and died the fourth day,
which was the 27th of last month. I will
do all in my power, as I promised him, to
find his brother if he is still living; and my
request is that you will help me. I have
notices out through all the western country.
He left a large amount in gold on deposit,
and a still larger property in buildings and
lots in the city. The rents are accumulating
on my hands, but I will make no further
investments until I know what will
happen.</p>

<p class="indent1">
Yours respectfully,</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">James Tracy</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>After making arrangements to communicate
with Tracy through the
editor, who was to receive and forward
drafts for him, Mr. Hennessy
set out for home.</p>

<p>The surprise of all upon hearing the
news may be imagined.</p>

<p>After a long consultation with his
wife, Mr. Hennessy sought Mr. Blair,
to whom he communicated the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
that the Michael of our narrative
was the son of his brother Michael;
that their own baby died in a fit on
the night of Bridget's death, and they
adopted the little motherless one in
its place, without saying any thing to
their companions, but intending to
inform his brother of the fact when
they should meet. Subsequent events
determined them to keep it still concealed;
but now that Michael was
the rightful heir to all this wealth, it
must be revealed.</p>

<p>Mr. Blair urged that, as his brother
left the property to him, it was just
as well to make no revelation on the
subject; but Mr. Hennessy insisted
that his brother made that arrangement
in ignorance of the existence of
his own child, and it would not be
right for him to take advantage of
it, and, in fine, that he would have
nothing to do with the property. It
was far more painful for him to give
up his claim upon Michael as his son,
and he did not feel equal to doing it
in person. He therefore begged Mr.
Blair to communicate these facts to
Michael for him.</p>

<p>That gentleman lost no time in fulfilling
the commission, and Michael
was of course overwhelmed with
amazement. He hastened to assure
his father that he would not consent
to any release of claims on the score
of family ties, and they both went
into a council with Mr. Blair upon
"the situation." Finally they determined
that Michael should transfer
all the money to his father, and, retaining
the real estate in his own
hands, go into the practice of law in
San Francisco himself. He at first
proposed to have the family go with
him to that place; but they had lived
so long in Vermont, and become so
much attached to M&mdash;&mdash;, that they
preferred not to leave.</p>

<p>Before Michael set out for California,
he had a long conversation with
Mr. Blair, at the conclusion of which
it was arranged that, after he had established
himself in his new home,
and opened an office there, he should
come back, and if a certain young
lady (who was about to become a
Catholic in "spite of him") could be
persuaded to accompany his return&mdash;as
he had good reason to hope she
would&mdash;his next journey to that far
off land would not be a solitary one.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>During the progress of these events,
the health of George Wingate had
been gradually failing, but so imperceptibly
as to create no serious alarm;
and he could not be prevailed upon
to abandon his studies, or the hope
that he would live to consecrate his
young life to his God in holy orders,
until it was near its close. Henry
Howe and Johnny Hart devoted
themselves tenderly to him, and watched
his decline with the grief which
under such circumstances always attends
friendships created and cemented
by religion. He began at length
to fail so rapidly that his family were
sent for, and he never returned to
the home of his childhood, but sleeps
in peace under the shadow of the
"Holy Cross" which he so dearly loved.</p>

<p>His mantle seemed to have fallen
upon his devoted friend, Johnny Hart,
who in due course of time entered
upon the vineyard from which his
beloved companion had been withdrawn
while the dews of the morning
still lingered upon his head, and
the labors of the day were hardly begun.</p>

<p>Soon after the death of George,
his oldest sister, Mary, joined the Sisters
of Charity.</p>

<p>In the same year, Henry Howe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
took his father's place in the mercantile
business, which was rapidly increasing
in importance with the growth
of the village, and Dennis Sullivan
went into partnership with him.</p>

<p>After Michael reached San Francisco,
he arranged his affairs, and
opened an office in one of the best
locations in the city, without delay.
He found a home in James Tracy's
house, and one of the best friends in
that worthy man, who took a pride
and interest in the son of his lamented
friend scarcely less than that of a
father.</p>

<p>Frank Blair became importunate in
his solicitations for the hand of Julia
Plimpton. Her mother steadfastly
declining to consent until he should
have established a character for sobriety
and stability, he became exasperated,
and abruptly left the navy.
His disconsolate family could get no
trace as to the course of his flight.</p>

<p>One day, as Michael Hennessy
was passing down the street to his
office, he observed a young man walking
rapidly in advance of him, and,
accidentally catching a side glimpse
of his face, what was his astonishment
to recognize Frank Blair.</p>

<p>"Why Frank, my lad, where in the
world did you come from?" he cried
out.</p>

<p>"Rather answer that question on
your own account!" replied the astonished
Frank. "How in the world
do you happen to be in San Francisco?"</p>

<p>"If I could have seen you as I
passed through New York, you would
have known all; but I could not find
you, and had no time to spare for a
long search," said Michael. "It is a
long story; so come with me to the
office, and you shall hear it."</p>

<p>When the friends were seated, Frank
told Michael that he had left the navy
without a discharge, and shipped as
seaman on board a vessel bound for
Panama; and that he supposed his
friends were wild with anxiety about
him.</p>

<p>Michael communicated the details
relating to his own affairs, with which
our readers are already acquainted.
He then wrote to Mr. Blair the story
of Frank's arrival in safety, and that
if he had no objections Frank would
study law with him in San Francisco.
Upon receiving the letter, Mr. Blair
obtained an honorable discharge for
his son from the navy, and consented
to his remaining with Michael. In
the course of time he went into partnership
with his friend&mdash;now his brother-in-law&mdash;who
has become one of
the most celebrated criminal lawyers
in that city.</p>

<h2>THE WORKS OF GERALD GRIFFIN.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></h2>


<p>Of the works of fiction in the English
language of which the first half
of this century has been so prolific,
Ireland has contributed at least a
fair proportionate share. Her writers
in this department of literature are
numerous, and their productions have
been generally received with due favor
on this side of the Atlantic as correct
portraitures of the habits and manners
of a people in whom we take so deep
an interest, and whose very contradictions
of character render them interesting
studies for the curious and philosophic.
Of so large a number four
at least deserve special notice, standing,
as they do, prominently in the
front rank of Irish authors and exhibiting
in a marked degree a pleasant
diversity of talent and invention, as
varied as the peculiar characteristics of
the provinces to which they belong.
Carleton, for example, was an Ulster-man,
rugged and ungraceful, yet possessing
a deep vein of caustic humor,
while his figures are struck out as
distinctly as if his pen had some of
the power Of Michael Angelo's chisel;
John Banim was the embodiment of
Leinster propriety and stability; Lever
is never so much at home as at the
mess-table of the "Rangers," or when
endangering the neck of his hero or
heroine over a Galway fence; while
through Gerald Griffin's pages flow,
now gently as a meandering stream and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>anon with the impetuosity of a mountain
torrent, the poetry and passion of
Munster. Still, in the strictest sense,
none of these novelists can be considered
national; yet all are true to
Irish character. To those unacquainted
with the radical difference of mind,
temperament, and even physique,
which is to be found in so comparatively
small a country, this may seem paradoxical;
but it is nevertheless true.
Mickey Frees and Lowry Lovbys are
plentiful enough in Ireland, but only
in their respective sections; while Valentine
McClutchy terrifies the northern
tenant each recurring gala-day,
and Banim's Paddy Flynn, to use the
pithy remark of Sir Philip Crampton,
"is hanged twice a year regularly in
the south of Ireland."</p>

<p>If any of them be entitled to the
term national, that honor should be
awarded to Griffin, who in his <cite>Invasion</cite>,
<cite>Duke of Monmouth</cite>, and some minor
stories, has travelled out of his favorite
province with some degree of
success. But even in his wanderings
in Wicklow, Taunton dene, and the
wilds of Northumbria, we are constantly
catching glimpses of the Shannon
and Killarney. The reason of
this is obvious. He aimed to be a
strict and minute copyist of nature;
and nature to him was bounded by
the lovely scenery of Munster and the
people with whom he had been in
daily intercourse for almost the whole
of his short life. His power of observation,
thus limited, became intensified,
and what he lost in breadth of view
and amplitude of knowledge, he gained
in the distinctness and fidelity of
his pictures. Besides, the merits of
the true novelist, like those of the
painter, should never be estimated by
the square of the canvas, but by his
faithfulness, either to human figure,
action, and circumstance, or to the
embodiment of noble ideas. It is
not so difficult as it may seem to call
up imaginary kings and princes, noble
lords and ladies, clothe them with
all the gorgeous panoply so easily
found in the pages of dear old Froissart,
or in the latest book of fashions,
and make them speak and act in the
most approved manner of our modern
romances, because few of us care
to inquire into the correctness either
of design or execution. Cervantes and
Goldsmith painted the men and manners
of their day with rare fidelity, and
their works will be read by the learned
and unlearned as long as the languages
in which they wrote shall exist;
and no one can doubt that two of the
most popular authors of our time,
Balzac and Dickens, no matter how
inferior in some respects to the authors
of <cite>Don Quixote</cite> and the <cite>Vicar
of Wakefield</cite>, have truly held up to us
panoramas of modern society in the
two great cities of Europe. For Gerald
Griffin we may not, perhaps, claim
the universality of those great masters;
but in purity of expression, truthfulness
to nature, and delicacy of moral
perception he is the equal of any of
them.</p>

<p>There are some persons conversant
with Irish character who maintain
that its essential element is neither
gayety nor combativeness, but
melancholy, and sustain their apparently
singular theory by reference
to the national music and poetry.
Griffin's writings would afford an
additional argument in favor of this
position. His genius was decidedly
tragic, his muse sad and retrospective.
His pauses to give us a glimpse
of fireside enjoyment appear to be
more as tributes to old home memories,
than as arising from any natural
desire to linger over the recollections
of such tranquil scenes; and his
snatches of humor and merriment
seem thrown in artistically, not so much
to relieve the sombre shading of his
picture as to give its most prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
figures greater depth and boldness.
He also labored under the disadvantage
of all tragic minds; for, though
he never can be said to have ignored
the "eternal fitness of things" in rewarding
the good and punishing the
wicked, we close many of his volumes
with a feeling more akin to sorrow
than rejoicing, and while admitting
the righteousness of his judgments, we
sigh to think how God's best gifts to
man may be turned to his own destruction.
It seems to be the law
of tragedy that the bad men must be
more men of action than the good,
in order to produce the proper effect.
They dress better, talk more persuasively,
and display high mental and
physical qualities which, say what
we may, will generally provoke a
certain sympathy for them, evil as
may be their acts. This inherent
defect Griffin labored to modify, if
he could not entirely eradicate. His
moral heroes are good enough in
their way, but their virtues are of
too negative a character. Kyrle
Daly, in the <cite>Collegians</cite>, and young
Kingsly, in the <cite>Duke of Monmouth</cite>,
have all the qualities we could desire
in a friend or brother; but while we
honor and respect them, a something
akin to sympathy is clandestinely
stealing out to the proud and wilful
Hardress Cregan, and even to the
cool malignity of that unparalleled
scoundrel, Colonel Kirke. O'Haedha,
in the <cite>Invasion</cite>, is an exception.
He is <i>sui generis</i> in Griffin's pantheon,
being not only a man of pure
morality and well up in the lore of
his times, but he is also a chieftain
governing wisely and firmly, a man
of war as well as of love and peace,
strong in his affections and hatreds,
living, moving, and breathing like
one who has a subtle brain, warm
blood, and a powerful arm to enforce
his authority. He is decidedly not
only Griffin's grandest conception,
but will stand in favorable comparison
with any we can recall in historical
romance.</p>

<p>The <cite>Collegians</cite> is Gerald Griffin's
best known and most popular novel;
and, when we consider the early age
of the author at the time it was written,
and the circumstances amid
which it was composed, we are equally
surprised at his knowledge of the
springs of human action, and at the
excellences of the book, both as regards
correctness of style and completeness
of plot. Though the working
of some of the strongest passions
of our nature is portrayed in it&mdash;love,
hatred, revenge, ambition&mdash;there is
nothing about them sensational or
melodramatic; and though many different
characters are introduced, and
incidents necessarily occur in a short
space of time, there is nothing hurried
or disjointed, one character acting
upon another and each event following
and hinging on the one preceding
so gracefully and naturally
that the reader is borne along on an
unbroken current, as it were, from
cause to effect till he reaches the
final catastrophe. It is related that
a portion of this admirable book was
written in court while the author, who
had attained considerable proficiency
as a short-hand writer in London,
was engaged in reporting an important
law case. During an interval in
the proceedings, Griffin took out his
manuscripts, and, as was his habit,
when a moment of leisure presented
itself, proceeded to continue his story,
regardless of his surroundings. It
happened that Daniel O'Connell was
employed professionally in the suit,
and not knowing the writer, and supposing
him to be occupied transcribing
his notes, looked over his shoulder
to read the evidence; but finding that
it was something very different from
the dry question and answer of counsellor
and witness, the great advocate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
turned away in silent indifference.
He little thought at the time that the
quiet, industrious young reporter was
Gerald Griffin, and that the work
upon which he was so intently engaged
was the <cite>Collegians</cite>&mdash;a work
which, from the day of its publication,
was ever the favorite solace of
the hours of relaxation of that illustrious
statesman.</p>

<p>The moral of the book, however,
is its greatest merit. The character of
Hardress Cregan is inimitably drawn.
Young, gifted both in person and
mind, with a disposition naturally inclined
to good, but warped and misled
by a fond, proud, worldly mother,
and the example of a dissolute father
and his associates; early left to his
own guidance and the indulgence of
his whims and fancies, he descends
from the high position in which we find
him at the opening chapter, through
all the stages of crime&mdash;parental disobedience,
ingratitude, deceit, debauchery,
and finally murder. Through
each step in guilt we can trace the
cause of his ruin&mdash;moral cowardice,
false pride, absence of self-control,
alternating or uniting, but always
with disastrous effect, until in the
culminating scene, in which, torn by
remorse and conscious guilt, he leaves
his native shores a condemned felon
and dies at sea, we feel that the
punishment, no matter how severe,
is but in strict accordance with
our highest sense of retributive justice.
Nor are the almost equally,
though perhaps unconsciously, guilty
parents forgotten. Like a just judge,
Griffin not only punishes the actual
perpetrator of crime, but metes out
penalties to those whose duty it is to
correct the excesses of youth, restrain
their passions, and lead them by
precept and example to the practice
as well as the knowledge of good,
and who neglect the sacred trust.
What parent, after reading the <cite>Collegians</cite>,
can contemplate without a
shudder the pangs of the haughty
mother and the utter hopelessness of
her dissipated husband, when they
found their only child, so tenderly
nurtured and so thoroughly schooled,
torn from their arms in chains, and
dying the death of an outcast and a
convict. Their punishment abided
in their parental hearts, and the author
goes no further. Many years
ago, we casually overheard one of the
most thoroughly read, as well as one
of the most profound thinkers in
America, say, upon being asked his
opinion of the <cite>Collegians</cite>, that he considered
it the best novel in the language;
for, while it made you hate
the crime, it did not take away your
charity for the criminal; an opinion
which we think will be concurred in
by all who have attentively read the
book and applied the moral it contains.
Kyrle Daly is an antipode
of his friend and fellow-student, Hardress
Cregan. His filial reverence
and moral rectitude are depicted in
his every action, and his whole character
is as beautiful and lovable as
that of the other is dark and fraught
with terrible warnings. Not that young
Daly is presented as a model lackadaisical
individual, by any means;
but as a strong man of matured mind
and deep feelings, true in friendship
and trusting in love; yet withal guided
by the dictates of his religion and
directed by the authority and advice
of his father and mother, a weakness,
if it be one, we are sorry to say, not
often indulged in at the present day.</p>

<p>Did the limits of our article permit,
we might furnish many extracts
from this remarkable novel in testimony
of the high opinion of the
merits found in its pages by so many
distinguished scholars, but the <cite>Collegians</cite>
is now so generally read that
this is hardly necessary. We transcribe,
however, the following brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
sketch of a morning on the Shannon,
and a breakfast scene, as a specimen
of the author's power of minute description
of rural scenery and felicitous
rendering of social life:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They had assembled, on the morning
of Eily's disappearance, a healthy and blooming
household of all sizes, in the principal
sitting-room, for a purpose no less important
than that of dispatching breakfast. It
was a favorable moment for any one who
might be desirous of sketching a family picture.
The windows of the room, which
were thrown up for the purpose of admitting
the fresh morning air, opened upon a trim
and sloping meadow, that looked sunny and
cheerful with the bright green after-grass of
the season. The broad and sheety river
washed the very margin of the little field,
and bore upon its quiet bosom (which was
only ruffled by the circling eddies that encountered
the advancing tide) a variety of
craft, such as might be supposed to indicate
the approach to a large city. Majestic vessels,
floating idly on the basined flood, with
sails half-furled, in keeping with the languid
beauty of the scene; lighters burdened to
the water's edge with bricks or sand; large
rafts of timber borne onward toward the
neighboring quays under the guidance of a
shipman's boat-hook; pleasure-boats with
gaudy pennons hanging at peak and topmast;
or turf-boats with their unpicturesque and
ungraceful lading, moving sluggishly forward,
while their black sails seemed gasping
for a breath to fill them&mdash;such were the incidents
that gave a gentle animation to the
prospect immediately before the eyes of the
cottage dwellers. On the further side of the
river arose the Cratloe hills, shadowed in
various places by a broken cloud, and rendered
beautiful by the checkered appearance
of the ripening tillage and the variety of
hues that were observable along their wooded
sides. At intervals, the front of a handsome
mansion brightened up a passing gleam
of sunshine, while the wreaths of blue smoke,
ascending at various distances from among
the trees, tended to relieve the idea of extreme
solitude which it would otherwise
have presented.</p>

<p>"The interior of the cottage was not less
interesting to contemplate than the landscape
which lay before it. The principal breakfast-table
(for there were two spread in the
room) was placed before the window, the
neat and snow-white damask cloth covered
with fare that spoke satisfactorily for the
circumstances of the proprietor, and for the
housewifery of his helpmate. The former,
a fair, pleasant-faced old gentleman, in a
huge buckled cravat and square-toed shoes,
somewhat distrustful of the meagre beverage
which fumed out of Mrs. Daly's lofty and
shining coffee-pot, had taken his position
before a cold ham and fowl which decorated
the lower end of the table. His lady, a
courteous old personage, with a face no less
fair and happy than her husband's, and with
eyes sparkling with good nature and intelligence,
did the honors of the board at the
further end. On the opposite side, leaning
over the back of his chair with clasped
hands, in an attitude which had a mixture
of abstraction and anxiety, sat Mr. Kyrle
Daly, the first pledge of connubial affection
that was born to this comely pair. He was
a young man already initiated in the rudiments
of the legal profession; of a handsome
figure, and in manner&mdash;but something now
pressed upon his spirits which rendered
this an unfavorable occasion for describing
him.</p>

<p>"A second table was laid in a more retired
portion of the room, for the accommodation
of the younger part of the family. Several
well-burnished goblets, or porringers, of
thick milk flanked the sides of this board,
while a large dish of smooth-coated potatoes
reeked up in the centre. A number of
blooming boys and girls, between the ages
of four and twelve, were seated at this simple
repast, eating and drinking away with
all the happy eagerness of youthful appetite.
Not, however, that this employment occupied
their exclusive attention; for the prattle
which circulated round the table frequently
became so boisterous as to drown the conversation
of the older people, and to call
forth the angry rebuke of the master of the
family.</p>

<p>"The furniture of the apartment was in
accordance with the appearance and manners
of its inhabitants. The floor was handsomely
carpeted, a lofty green fender fortified the
fireplace, and supplied Mr. Daly in his facetious
moments with occasions for the frequent
repetition of a favorite conundrum,
'Why is that fender like Westminster Abbey?'&mdash;a
problem with which he never failed
to try the wit of any stranger who happened
to spend a night beneath his roof.
The wainscoted walls were ornamented with
several of the popular prints of the day, such
as Hogarth's Roast Beef, Prince Eugene,
Schomberg at the Boyne, Mr. Betterton
playing Cato in all the glory of</p>

<p class="center">
'Full wig, flowered gown, and lackered chair;'<br />
</p>

<p>of the royal Mandane, in the person of Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
Mountain, strutting among the arbors of her
Persian palace in a lofty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tÃªte</i> and hooped petticoat.
There were also some family drawings
done by Mrs. Daly in her school-days,
of which we feel no inclination to say more
than that they were prettily framed. In justice
to the fair artist, it should also be mentioned
that, contrary to the established practice,
her sketches were never retouched by
the hand of her master, a fact which Mr.
Daly was fond of insinuating, and which no
one who saw the pictures was tempted to call
in question. A small book-case, with the
edges of the shelves handsomely gilded, was
suspended in one corner of the room, and,
on examination, might be found to contain
a considerable number of works on Irish history,
for which study Mr. Daly had a national
predilection, a circumstance much deplored
by all the impatient listeners in his
neighborhood, and (some people hinted) in
his own household; some religious books,
and a few volumes on cookery and farming.
The space over the lofty chimney-piece was
assigned to some ornaments of a more startling
description. A gun-rack, on which
were suspended a long shore gun, a brass-barreled
blunderbuss, a cutlass, and a case
of horse-pistols, manifested Mr. Daly's determination
to maintain, if necessary, by
force of arms, his claim to the fair possessions
which his honest industry had acquired.</p>

<p>"'Kyrle,' said Mr. Daly, putting his fork
into a breast of cold goose, and looking at
his son, 'you had better let me put a little
goose (with an emphasis) on your plate.
You know you are going a-wooing to-day.'</p>

<p>"The young gentleman appeared not to
hear him. Mrs. Daly, who understood
more intimately the nature of her son's reflections,
deprecated, by a significant look at
her husband, the continuance of any raillery
upon so delicate a subject.</p>

<p>"'Kyrle, some coffee?' said the lady of
the house; but without being more successful
in awakening the attention of the young
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Mr. Daly winked at his wife.</p>

<p>"'Kyrle!' he called aloud, in a tone
against which even a lover's absence was
not proof, 'do you hear what your mother
says?'</p>

<p>"'I ask pardon, sir&mdash;I was absent&mdash;I&mdash;what
were you saying, mother?'</p>

<p>"'She was saying,' continued Mr. Daly,
with a smile, 'that you were manufacturing
a fine speech for Anna Chute, and that you
were just meditating whether you should
deliver it on your knees or out of brief, as
if you were addressing the bench in the Four
Courts.'</p>

<p>"'For shame, my dear! Never mind him,
Kyrle; I said no such thing. I wonder how
you can say that, my dear, and the children
listening.'</p>

<p>"'Pooh! the little angels are too busy and
too innocent to pay us any attention,' said
Mr. Daly, lowering his voice, however.
'But, speaking seriously, my boy, you take
this affair too deeply to heart; and whether
it be in our pursuit of wealth, or fame, or
even in love itself, an extreme solicitude to
be successful is the surest means of defeating
its own object. Besides, it argues an
unquiet and unresigned condition. I have
had a little experience, you know, in affairs
of this kind,' he added, smiling and glancing
at his fair helpmate, who blushed with
the simplicity of a young girl.</p>

<p>"'Ah sir!' said Kyrle, as he drew nearer
to the breakfast-table with a magnanimous
affectation of cheerfulness, 'I fear I have
not so good a ground for hope as you may
have had. It is very easy, sir, for one to be
resigned to disappointment, when he is certain
of success.'</p>

<p>"'Why, I was not bidden to despair indeed,'
said Mr. Daly, extending his hand
to his wife, while they exchanged a quiet
smile, which had in it an expression of tenderness
and of melancholy remembrance.</p>

<p>"'I have, I believe, been more fortunate
than more deserving persons. I have never
been vexed with useless fears in my wooing
days, nor with vain regrets when those days
were ended. I do not know, my dear lad,
what hopes you have formed, or what prospects

but I will not wish you a better fortune than
that you may as nearly approach to their accomplishment
as I have done, and that time
may deal as fairly with you as he has done

Daly leaned forward on the table, with his
temple supported by one finger, and glanced
alternately from his children to his wife
while he sang in a low tone the following
verse of a popular song:</p>

<p>We cannot close this imperfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
sketch of the <cite>Collegians</cite> without commending
the treatment of the humbler
personages introduced, equally free
as they are from that stilted phraseology
and broad caricature which too
often disgrace Irish novels and so-called
Irish plays. Poor Eily O'Connor,
in all her simple innocence and
ignorance of the world, is a beautiful
creation; and though travestied in
three or four different forms on the
stage, she still holds a lasting place in
our affections. Her meeting with her
discarded lover, Myles Murphy the
mountaineer, presents us a scene of
touching pathos such as only, we imagine,
an Irish peasant could express
in his native tongue:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'There is only one person to blame in
all this business,' murmured the unhappy
girl, 'and that is Eily O'Connor.'</p>

<p>"'I don't say that,' returned the mountaineer.
'It's no admiration to me you
should be heart-broken with all the persecution
we gave you day afther day. All I'm
thinking is, I'm sorry you didn't mention it
to myself unknownst. Sure it would be betther
for me than to be as I was afther, when
I heerd you were gone. Lowry Lovby told
me first of it, when I was eastwards. Oh
ro! such a life as I led afther. Lonesome
as the mountains looked before, when I used
to come home thinkin' of you, they looked
ten times lonesomer afther I heerd of that
story. The ponies, poor crathers&mdash;see 'em
all, how they're lookin' down at us this moment&mdash;they
didn't hear me spring the rattle
on the mountain for a month afther. I suppose
they thought it is in Garryowen I was.'</p>

<p>"Here he looked upward, and pointing to
his herd, a great number of which were collected
in groups on the broken cliffs above
the road, some standing so far forward on
the projections of rock as to appear magnified
against the dusky sky, Myles sprang
the large wooden rattle which he held in his
hand, and in an instant all dispersed and
disappeared, like the clan of a Highland
chief at the sound of their leader's whistle.</p>

<p>"'Well, Myles,' said Eily, at length collecting
a little strength, 'I hope we'll see
some happy days in Garryowen yet.'</p>

<p>"'Heaven send it! I'll pack off the boy to-night
to town, or I'll go myself, if you like,
or I'll get you a horse and truckle, and guide
it myself for you, or I'll do any thing in the
whole world that you'll have me. Look at
this. I'd rather be doing your bidding this
moment than my own mother's, and heaven
forgive me, if that's a sin! Ah Eily! they
may say this and that o' you, in the place
where you were born; but I'll ever hold to it,
I held to it all through, an' I'll hold to it to
my death, that when you darken your father's
door again, you will send no shame before
you.'</p>

<p>"'You are right in that, Myles.'</p>

<p>"'Didn't I know I was? And wasn't it
that that broke my heart! If one met me
afther you flitted away, an' saw me walking
the road with my hands in my pockets and
my head down, an' I thinking; an' if he
sthruck me on the shoulder, an' "Myles,"
says he, "don't grieve for her, she's this an'
that," and if he proved it to me, why, I'd look
up that minute an' I'd smile in his face. I'd
be as easy from that hour as if I never crossed
your threshold at Garryowen! But knowing
in my heart, and as my heart told me,
that it never could be that way; that Eily
was still the old girl always, an' hearing what
they said o' you, an' knowing that it was I
that brought it all upon you&mdash;O Eily! Eily!&mdash;O
Eily O'Connor! there is not that man
upon Ireland ground that can tell what I
felt. That was what kilt me! That was
what drove the pain into my heart, and kept
me in the doctor's hands till now.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Altogether different in design and
scope is the <cite>Invasion</cite>, a historical novel
intended to describe the institutions,
manners, and ways of life of the ancient
Irish, and it is much to be regretted that
it is so little read by the descendants
of that peculiar people, especially by
those who turn aside from the difficulties
of nomenclature presented by the
actual history of Ireland. With the
same motive that actuated Scott to
present the otherwise unattractive and
obscure facts of the early history of
Britain in the fascinating garb of romance,
our author, always deeply imbued
with love of country and reverence
for the past, sought in this book
to give a complete picture of the public,
social, and religious life of his ancestors
as it was known or supposed to exist
in the eighth century, before the repeated
incursions of the Northmen had
desolated their valleys, razed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
towns, and pillaged their churches and
seats of learning. To most men of a
fine imagination and poetic temperament
like Griffin, the study of laws
long disused and customs forgotten
centuries ago, wrapt up as they were in
a language almost unintelligible to
modern scholars, would have presented
insuperable difficulties; but to him it
seems to have been a labor of love,
and it is a source of lasting regret
that his opportunities for research were
not in proportion to his diligence.
The invaluable records of Irish history
and antiquities since brought to
light through the labors of O'Curry,
Pietrie, O'Donovan, and others, were
then slumbering in the mouldy archives
of Trinity College, or scattered
in inaccessible places over England
and the continent; nor are we aware
that the author of the <cite>Invasion</cite> had
such thorough knowledge of his native
language as would enable him to decipher
those ancient manuscripts, even
had he the facility for so doing. The
barbarous policy of the dominant
power, which formerly not only sought
to destroy the language of the conquered
people by prohibiting its being
taught in colleges, but made it penal
to allow it to be spoken in the humbler
country schools, was equally interested
in keeping from the world
at large the Irish people's records and
book of laws, the evidences of their
former glory and greatness and the
muniments of their nationality; and
even in this advanced age we owe
mainly to local enterprise and private
generosity whatever contributions to
ancient Irish history we have been
favored with for the last twenty years.
The government of England is willing
to spend annually tens of thousands
of pounds sterling to facilitate the discovery
of the sources of the Nile or to
encourage the translation of the high-flown
vagaries of East Indian poets;
font it cannot afford, it appears, a
miserable allowance to rescue from
obscurity the annals of one of the most
ancient and civilized nations of Europe;
a nation, too, that has the misfortune
to be called an integral portion of the
British empire.</p>

<p>This necessarily limited knowledge
of the epoch which he proposed to illustrate,
while it in some degree unfortunately
lessens the authority of
the novel in an antiquarian point of
view, does not impair its harmony of
design, or weaken the moral and intellectual
beauty of its entire composition;
and even its technical defects
are, to a great extent, corrected in the
edition before us, by the insertion, in
the form of an appendix, of the very
valuable critical notes of the late Professor
O'Curry. The principal figure
in the book is O'Headha, (O'Hea,) a
young chieftain born on the day of
his father's death in battle. It describes
the ceremonies of the marriage
of his parents and of his own
baptism, as introductory to his career.
His education is supposed to be conducted
at Mungharid (Mungret) Abbey,
then famous for the number and
rank of its scholars; and this gives
the author an opportunity of describing
the monastery, a description which
may be taken as applying equally to
the many similar institutions of piety
and learning which at that time, and
for centuries before, dotted the then
happy island:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Unlike many of the religious foundations
of that period, which were constructed,
after the national manner, of wood, the college
of Muinghairid was a damhliag, or
stone building, and its grouted fragments,
diffused at this day over an extensive tract
of ground, demonstrate the masonic skill
of its founders. The religious, who were
of the order of St. Mainchin, the founder
of the abbey, and of prodigious number,
had, as is usual in such establishments,
their various duties appointed to them.
Some devoted themselves wholly to a life
of contemplation and of manual labor.
Others employed themselves in the care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
the sick, the entertaining of strangers, the
giving of alms, and the instruction of the
numerous youth who flocked hitherward in
great numbers from different parts of the
island, from the shore of Inismore, and even
from those of some continental nations.
Those who were skilled in psalmody succeeded
each other in the choir, night and day,
which for many a century sent forth its
never-ceasing harmony of praise; while far
the greater number were employed in cultivating
with their own hands the extensive
tracts of ground which lay around the convent
and the neighboring city. Morn after
morn, regular as the dawn itself, the tolling of
the convent-bell, over the spreading woods
which then enriched the neighborhood,
awoke the tenants of the termon-lands, warning
them that its cloistered inhabitants had
commenced their daily rule, and reminding
them also of that eternal destiny which was
seldom absent from the minds of the former.
The religious, answering to the summons,
resumed their customary round of duties.
Some aided the almoner in receiving the
applications of the poor and attending to
their wants. Some assisted the chamberlain
in refitting the deserted dormitory.
Some were appointed to help the infirmarian
in the hospital. Some aided the pittancer
and cellarer in preparing the daily refection,
as well for the numerous members of
the confraternity as for the visitors, for whose
accommodation a separate refectory was furnished;
and after the solemn rite of the
morning, at which all assisted, had been
concluded, the great body of the monks departed
to their daily labor on the adjoining
tillage and pasturage lands.</p>

<p>"Sometimes at this early hour the more
infirm and aged, as well as the more pious
of the neighboring peasantry, were seen
thridding their way along the woodland
paths to mingle in the morning devotions
of the religious. The peasant as he trotted
on by his car, laden with the produce of the
season, paused for an instant to hear the
matin hymn, and added a prayer that heaven
might sanctify his toil. The fisherman,
whose curach glided rapidly along the broad
surface of the river, rested on his oars at the
same solemn strain, and resumed his labor
with a more measured stroke and less eager
spirit. The son of war and rapine, who
galloped by the place, returning with sated
passions from some nocturnal havoc, reined
up his hobbie at the peaceful sounds, and
yielded his mind unconsciously to an interval
of mercy and remorse. The oppressive
chieftain and his noisy retinue, not yet recovered
the dissipation of some country
<i>coshering</i>, hushed for a time their unseemly
mirth as they passed the holy dwelling and
yielded in reverence the debt which they
could not pay in sympathy. To many an
ear the sounds of the orison arrived, and to
none without a wholesome and awakening
influence."</p></blockquote>

<p>Arrived at manhood, the future
chieftain is duly installed in office
according to the prevailing customs
of the sept, and henceforth we find
him performing all the duties appertaining
to his high position, including
his attendance at the triennial assembly
of Tara, <i>Ã  propos</i> to which we have
an elaborate and highly interesting
account of that historical gathering
of all the estates of the kingdoms into
which the island was then divided.
A romantic adventure, ending in a
love scene, of course, brings him
among the Hooded people, the last
remnant of those who, rejecting the
teachings of St. Patrick and his disciples,
continued to practise the Druidical
rites in seclusion; and, as a consequence,
we find a detailed description
of the objects and forms of that
extinct species of idolatry. The invasion
itself, the first descent of the
Northmen on the coast, successfully
repulsed by O'Hea's forces, naturally
leads to a disquisition on the gloomy
superstition and uncouth manners of
those terrible barbarians. Thus we
find grouped together, gracefully and
artistically, the leading historical features
of the period, the old superstitions
and the beneficent fruits of the
new faith, the faults and follies, virtues
and graces of the christianized
Celts, contrasted with the physical
prowess and ferocious temperament of
the hordes who were so soon to deluge
with blood, not only Erin, but
the adjacent isles and the greater part
of the coasts of Europe. Strange to
say, the <cite>Invasion</cite> is the only Irish historical
novel ever written, and, as
Augustin Thierry was induced to write
his celebrated history of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span><cite>Norman
Conquest of England</cite> by reading
Scott's <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>, may we not hope
that some present or future writer may
be inspired by the <cite>Invasion</cite> to give
us a detailed and intelligible account
of the Danish wars in Ireland?</p>

<p>The <cite>Duke of Monmouth</cite> is also a
historical novel, but more modern in
its character and incidents. It is intended
to describe the condition of
the people of the rural districts in the
west of England about the close of
the seventeenth century; and the
principal events upon which the story
depends are the invasion of England
by the ill-starred Duke of Monmouth,
the illegitimate son of Charles II.,
during the reign of the latter's successor,
the fatal battle of Sedgemoor,
and the execution of the adventurer
and his principal followers. The style
is faultless, the prominent actors mostly
taken from real life, though few
are truthfully drawn. Still, we cannot
but regret for the sake of poetical
justice that Griffin chose this subject
for a novel, from the fact that the
truth of history compelled him to let
the notorious Kirke, who figures so
largely in his pages, go unwhipped of
justice. The portrait of this infamous
soldier, whose vices were proverbial,
is thus briefly sketched:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He beheld before him a man somewhat
over the middle size, and rather spare than
otherwise; his features not ill-looking, but
marked by that expression of malign placidity
which is no less characteristic of the
genuine tyrant than all the ogre-like contortions
and grimaces vulgarly associated with
the idea of habitual cruelty. There was
something like a smile upon his lips; but it
was a smile that spoke not of benevolence
of the heart, and held out no light of promise
to the hope of the supplicant. His
very courtesy, all easy as it was, seemed the
refined dissimulation of a callous nature.
There was a kind of sternness in his very
courtliness of manner, a severity even in
the smoothness and gentleness of his demeanor
and discourse, that was more withering
than the open violence of the unmasked and
ruffian oppressor. At times, too, it was
said he could be all the savage; but it was
only when the security of his position afforded
a free scope to license. His hair was
already tinged with gray, though in so slight
a degree as to be scarcely perceptible. His
complexion had much of the sallowness, but
little of the languor, usually acquired by long
residence in tropical countries; and, as he
stood glancing rapidly over the paper which
he held in his hand, it might be judged from
the keenness and concentration of his look
that his mind, in like manner, had lost nothing
of its activity beneath the enervating
influence of an African sun."</p></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding the fault referred
to, the book is one that merits attention
both as being the production of
the author's more mature years and
as furnishing us an insight into the
modes of life, manner of living, and
unreasonable preconceptions of politics
and religion of the humbler classes
of England at the period immediately
preceding the downfall of the house
of Stuart. The so-called reformation
in that country, while it deprived the
peasantry of all the attractions and
consolations of true religion, as well as
of the innocent sports and pastimes so
much encouraged by the church, left
nothing in their stead to lighten the
heavy burden of labor save the sensual
attractions of the ale-house, or
the more invigorating, if more hazardous,
luxury of rebellion. Deprived
of the refuge always afforded by the
eleemosynary institutions of the monks
to the deserving needy and afflicted,
the wants of the widow and the orphan
were neglected, the poor became
poorer and more discontented, and
the nobles more haughty and overbearing.
The reformers succeeded in unsettling
the religious faith of the masses,
as the wars of the Commonwealth
destroyed their ideas of authority and
obedience. Hence followed in rapid
rotation the restoration of Charles
II., the dethronement of James, the
Scotch rebellions of 1715 and 1745,
and many if not all the evils which
have afflicted the people of Great Britain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
up to the present time&mdash;evils
which have become so glaring that a
thousand acts of parliament cannot
hide them, and distress, ignorance, and
its attendant vices, so gross and general
as to be beyond the cure of the poor-house
and the penitentiary. Considered
in the aggregate, England is one
of the wealthiest countries in the
world. Individually, her people are
the poorest in Christendom; for she
contains within her boundaries a larger
percentage of paupers and those
who live by crime of various degrees
than any civilized country on the face
of the globe.</p>

<p>It was while in this transition state,
from "merrie" England in Catholic
times to her present anomalous condition,
that the Duke of Monmouth,
relying on the ignorance and anti-Catholic
prejudices of the rustic population,
resolved to dispute the possession
of the throne with James II., whose
only fault, in the eyes of his enemies
at that time, was his desire to concede
some degree of toleration to his dissenting
and Catholic subjects. Monmouth's
miserable failure is a matter
of history; but in this book we have
likewise a glimpse of the feeling of the
people who followed his standard, and
which afterward led to the elevation
of William of Orange, and of the sentiments
which actuated the British portion
of that prince's army in his subsequent
wars in the sister island. The
author also gives a very just idea of
Monmouth and his subordinate rebels.
The duke himself is represented as
possessing all those exterior graces
which are said to have distinguished
the Stuarts, with more than all their
vices and instability of character&mdash;false
to his friends, cringing to his enemies,
superstitious without faith, and ambitious
without the courage or capacity
to command success. Fletcher, his
chief counsellor and best officer, is a
keen, hard-headed, but passionate
Covenanter, a theoretical republican
of the Roundhead school engrafted
on the antique; Lord Grey and Ferguson
are simply respectable adventurers,
equally destitute of honesty or
brains, and worthy instruments in so
desperate an enterprise. In comparison
with those men, the devotion of
young Fullarton to a hopeless cause
becomes less blamable; and even the
ultra loyalty of the old cavalier, Captain
Kingsly, is respectable.</p>

<p>In addition to what we have before
remarked of the design of this work,
there is a feature in its composition
which by some readers may be considered
a grave defect. The interest
which surrounds the heroine, Aquila
Fullarton, from the very beginning of
the tale deepens by degrees until it
becomes painfully intense, and the
scene between her and Kirke, wherein
that monster perpetrates one of the
greatest crimes known to humanity,
and she in consequence loses her reason,
though founded on well-authenticated
facts, and described with all the
delicacy of diction possible, is almost
too horrible to receive mention.
The necessarily gloomy pages of the
story are occasionally enlivened by the
introduction of two Irish characters&mdash;brothers&mdash;Morty
and Shamus Delaney,
who, like so many of their
countrymen, then and since, have left
home to seek their fortunes, and find
themselves in Taunton on the eve of
the stirring events related in the novel.
Morty, being of a practical turn of
mind, forthwith enlists in "Kirke's
Lambs;" but Shamus, whose tastes are
also pugnacious, but whose ambition
is to wear epaulettes, takes service on
the other side, and raises a company
of ragamuffins not unlike that which
shamed the redoubtable Falstaff at
Coventry. There are many exquisite
bits of humor scattered through Griffin's
works, which might be quoted as
evincing his keen appreciation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
ludicrous; but we prefer to extract
the following address of Captain Delaney
to his command, for the benefit
of our military readers who have neglected
studying the articles of war.
Shamus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loquitur</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Well, I see ye're all here, exceptin'
those that's absent. Well, then, fall in,
fall in, an' much good may it do ye! An'
now attind to my ordhers, an' mind 'em
well. Every man is to fight, an' nobody is
to run; that's plain enough. Secondly, any
man that wants arms, is to fight hard <em>for</em>
'em first, an' to fight <em>with</em> 'em at his aise
afther. Thirdly, any booty whatsomever
that any o' ye may take in the war, such as
goold rings, watches, sails, valuable clothing,
an' the likes&mdash;but above all things,
money&mdash;ye're to bring it all to me. Do you
hear me?'</p>

<p>"'Ay, ay, ay!'</p>

<p>"'Very well. Because I'm captain, ye
know, an' best judge how it ought to be
divided. For it is one o' the maxims of
war, that it's the part o' the common sodgers
for to fight, an' for the ladin' officers
for to have all the call to the booty an' the
likes, how 'tis to be shared, an' what's to be
done with it. Do ye hear?'</p>

<p>"'Ay, ay!'</p>

<p>"'An' if there's any thing that's very
dangerous&mdash;certain death, for instance&mdash;as a
place where one would be blown up, an' the
likes, it's the custom o' war for the common
sodgers to have it all to themselves, an' for
the officer to give 'em ordhers for to face it,
but to stay behind himself, bein' more valuable.
Do ye hear?'</p>

<p>"'Ay, ay!'</p>

<p>"'An' if there be a scarcity o' food or
clothin', or beddin', an' the likes, or a dale
to do, sech as diggin' threnches an' the likes
o' that, then it's the custom o' war for the
officer to have the first o' the victuals an'
things that way; but the sodgers is to have
the first o' the labor always. Do ye understand?'</p>

<p>"'Ay, ay!'</p>

<p>"'Very well, why. Now, mind the word!
Shoulder your picks! Quick, march!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Of Griffin's minor works, included
under the titles of <cite>Tales of the Munster
Festivals</cite> and <cite>Tales of my Neighborhood</cite>,
the <cite>Rivals</cite>, <cite>Barber of Bantry</cite>,
and <cite>Shuil Dhuv</cite> are decidedly the
most entertaining. The latter particularly,
though irregular in composition,
is a story evincing great dramatic
power and knowledge of the
human heart. The dark-eyed hero,
if such he may be called, who gives
the title to the tale, stands out before
us in all the enormity of his guilt as
distinctly as if he had been an actual
acquaintance, and we venture to say
that there are few who have read the
book but have experienced that feeling.
In this story, also, Griffin departs
from his usual custom of avoiding
personal description of his female
characters, and gives us an elaborate
picture of his heroine, which, whether
it be drawn from life or the creation
of his own imagination, calls up before
us an image of surpassing loveliness.</p>

<p>Griffin's other tales, such as the
<cite>Half-Sir</cite>, <cite>Card-Drawing</cite>, and <cite>Tracey's
Ambition</cite>, have all much merit, and,
though not so prolonged as those we
have mentioned, exhibit in a greater
or lesser degree the skilful hand and
rich imagination of the author. The
<cite>Christian Physiologist</cite>, comprising a
series of beautiful tales intended to
illustrate the use and abuse of the
senses, is worthy a place near the
writings of that friend of childhood,
Canon Schmidt.</p>

<p>As a poet, Griffin is remarkable for
the beauty of his delineations of natural
scenery, his elevation of sentiment
and purity of conception. His
lyrics remind us of Moore, and are
scarcely inferior to some of the best
of that immortal bard's in feeling and
choiceness of metaphor; but being
somewhat deficient in rhythm, they
have never found much favor in the
drawing or concert-room, "A Place
in thy Memory, Dearest," "My Mary
of the Curling Hair," and one or two
others excepted. Many of his poems
were from time to time contributed to
the London journals, while he was yet
a literary drudge in that city; others
are to be found interspersed in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
novels, and not a few were written to
gratify his friends, and were first given
to the public when his entire poetical
works, as far as it was possible, were
collected together in book-form, and
now fill a large volume, not the least
important of the present edition.
We are not aware that he ever attempted
an epic or any thing more
extended than the beautiful ballad of
<cite>Matt Hyland</cite>, of the merits of which
we can only judge by the fragment
which has been preserved, the original
having been destroyed by the
author immediately previous to his

<p>Of his dramas but one remains to

us regret that Griffin abandoned writing

We are inclined to imagine that a
young man, scarcely twenty years of
age, who was capable of managing
so successfully a subject that required
the highest powers of Boccaccio,
could in his maturer years have effected
even greater things. However, we
must console ourselves with the reflection

<h2>THE POPE AND THE COUNCIL, BY JANUS.<br />

<small>III.</small></h2>

<p>Of all arguments brought forward
by <i>Janus</i> to undermine what he
would term the historical groundwork
of papal supremacy, and the prerogatives
exercised by the successors of
St. Peter, none seem to have greater
weight, or more forcibly convince his
admirers, than the long narration on
"Forgeries;" and hence throughout
his work the "Isidorian fabrications"
play a great <i>rÃ´le</i>. Ostensibly these
forgeries are developed at great length
with a view of merely overthrowing
and combating this "powerful coalition"
of ultramontanism, but in reality
the arguments deduced from these
forgeries go far beyond this <em>avowed</em>
intention of our authors.</p>

<p>Up to the ninth century no change
had taken place in the constitution
of the church, as they readily admit:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But in the middle of that century, about
845, arose the huge fabrication of the Isidorian
decretals, which had results far beyond
what its author contemplated, and gradually
but surely changed the whole constitution
and government of the church." (P. 76.)</p></blockquote>

<p>1st. In our first article (p. 330) we
have already pointed out this illogical
inconsistency of <i>Janus</i>, when assuming
a lawful development of the constitution
of the church in the first
eight centuries; whereas he by no
means defines what he understands
by a <i>lawful</i> development of the <i>divine</i>
constitution of the ancient church.
How can he, therefore, decide that the
Isidorian decretals wrought an entire
and unlawful development of the
rights and privileges of the primacy?</p>

<p>2d. If the <i>picture of the organization
of the ancient church</i> is quietly, and as
a matter of course, presented as one
of <i>divine</i> origin,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> we have no hesitation
in declaring that picture a false
one, and contrary to the most ancient
history of the church. It cannot even
claim apostolic origin in so comprehensive
a meaning as <i>Janus</i> would
have it. The different grades of the
hierarchy, established between the primacy
and episcopacy, is the result
of a <i>historical</i> development, whereas
<i>divine</i> institution can only be claimed
for the <i>primacy</i> and <i>episcopacy</i> themselves.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>What difference is there between
bishops as to power and jurisdiction
over one another by <i>divine</i> right?
If patriarchs, primates, and metropolitans
have exercised certain prerogatives
<i>greater</i> than those enjoyed by
other bishops, will <i>Janus</i> tell us that
this is owing to divine origin? How,
then, will he account for the fact that
no such distinction was universally
acknowledged<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> until the <i>third</i> century
in the east? nay more, that in
the west there were no metropolitans
before the latter half of the <i>fourth</i>
century, if we except Africa, and even
in this latter country many bishops
were exempt, and directly subject to
the see of Rome?<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>It is a notorious fact, though <i>Janus</i>
elsewhere so boldly denies it, that the
bishops of Rome deputed other bishops
as their representatives in many
provinces, who by that very fact exercised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>authority over other bishops,
because to them the popes delegated
the exercise of primatial prerogatives.
Thus, the Bishop of Thessalonica is
constituted, by the pope, Primate of
Illyricum, and the Bishop of Arles,
Primate of Gaul.</p>

<p>There are still many letters of the
popes addressed to the bishops of
Thessalonica as early as the fourth
century, by Innocent I., Boniface I.,
Celestine I., and Sixtus III., wherein
instructions are given concerning the
exercise of the <i>special</i> power conferred
on them.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Hence it came to pass
that certain episcopal sees retained
that high rank granted to their first
incumbents, either as primates or metropolitans,
after having acted in the
beginning in the quality of apostolic
legates. St. Leo the Great, in his
letter to Anastasius of Thessalonica,
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have intrusted our charge in such
a way to you that you are called on to <i>share</i>
our solicitude, <i>not</i> possessing the plenitude
of power."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To grant to the Bishop of Rome
the honor of being the "first patriarch,"
is nothing less than ignoring or
setting aside numerous and indubitable
facts <i>long before</i> the existence of
the Isidorian decretals.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> We should
like to be informed by <i>Janus</i> and
his abettors where the documents
exist proving the rights of patriarchs
as of <i>divine</i> institution? All canonists
of any repute maintain that the
preÃ«minence of rank and jurisdiction
accorded to patriarchs, primates, and
metropolitans is <i>not</i> due to the episcopate
by <i>divine</i> institution; but, on
the contrary, all agree that this is a
concession, whether <i>express</i> or <i>tacit</i>,
on the part of the popes of Rome as
successors of Peter, being admitted
by them to a <i>participation</i> of their
primatial prerogatives. Hence all
are the representatives of the primacy,
whenever they are appealed to as
a <i>higher</i> tribunal, and as such can
only lawfully hold this preÃ«minence
among their brother bishops as long
as they do not come in conflict with
the divinely established order in the
church, which consists in the principle
that the pope possesses, by <i>divine</i> ordinance,
<i>jurisdiction over the entire
episcopate</i>. Pope St. Leo the Great
gives a beautiful portrait of this organization
in the church very dissimilar
from that of <i>Janus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The connection of the whole body demands
unanimity, and especially unity among
the prelates. While the dignity is common
to all, there is no general equality of order;
because even among the blessed apostles,
though sharing the same honor, there was
a difference of power, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quÃ¦dam discretio potestatis</i>,)
and while all were equally chosen,
yet to one was given the prerogative of
presiding over the others.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> From which precedent
also arose a distinction among bishops,
and with perfect order was it enacted that
all should not in like manner assume all
powers, but that there be in every province
some who exercise the right of <i>first</i> judges
among their brethren; and again, that there
should be some (bishops) in the larger cities
possessing more ample powers, through
whom the care of the universal church devolves
upon the one chair of Peter, and that
in this manner there may never be any separation
from the head."</p></blockquote>

<p>3d. According to <i>Janus</i>, Nicolas
I., by means of the Isidorian forgery,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"opened to the whole clergy in east and
west a right of appeal to Rome, and made
the pope the supreme judge of all bishops
and clergy of the whole world." (P. 79.)</p></blockquote>

<p>That "bold but non-natural" torturing
of the seventeenth canon of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>the Council of Chalcedon attributed
to Nicolas I., is nothing else but a
pure fiction on the part of <i>Janus</i>.
The letter sent by the pope to the
Emperor Michael III. is a document
evincing the learning, sagacity, and
prudence of Nicolas I., in that grave
disturbance caused by Photius and
corrupt courtiers against the lawful
patriarch, Ignatius of Constantinople.</p>

<p>When the latter, for the conscientious
discharge of his pastoral duty
and vigilance toward a licentious
court, had been violently deposed,
and Photius, a relative of the emperor,
put in his place, recourse was had
to Rome to obtain sanction of these
proceedings. The pope sent legates
to Constantinople to investigate the
matter laid before him; these in their
turn, being partly misled, partly bribed,
ratified all that had been done.
Pope Nicolas, upon hearing this,
excommunicated the legates and annulled
the election of Photius. The
latter, seconded by the intrigues of
the court, protested against this act
of the pope whose authority he had
previously invoked. Hence, Nicolas
I., in the above-mentioned letter,
reasons by <i>analogy</i> that the seventeenth
canon of the Council of Chalcedon,
respecting appeals to primates
or to the patriarch of Constantinople,
was in a higher sense applicable to
the <i>Bishop</i> of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> It clearly follows
from the canon in question<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
that it merely intended to regulate
the several instances of appeal for
clerics, and alluded to the special
privilege of appealing to the Patriarch
of Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>In the present instance, however,
is it not evident that the patriarch
could not be his own judge, and,
since a final decision was demanded,
on whom did this right devolve, we
may ask, if not on the Bishop of
Rome? A similar and even more
striking argument may be seen in the
letter addressed by Nicolas I. to
the Frankish king, Charles the Bald.
Rothad, Bishop of Soissons, having
been deposed by Hincmar, Archbishop
of Rheims, appealed to Pope
Nicolas, who, after examining, caused
the bishop to be restored; and in his
reasons for doing so sustains, first, the
<i>divine</i> right of the chair of Peter to
receive appeals and to act as supreme
judge; and then goes on stating that,
as the canon of Chalcedon granted
the right of judging to the primates
or to the see of Constantinople, in like
manner also, and with much more reason,
must the same rule be observed
regarding the right of the see of
Rome. If, therefore, adds the pope,
Rothad of Soissons appealed to the
chair of Peter conformably to the
Synod of Sardica, this action was perfectly
lawful, and there were many
precedents for this in history; as, for
example, the appeals made by St.
Athanasius to Julius I. and St. John
Chrysostom to Innocent I.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Here,
then, the reader will judge of the <i>historical</i>
fairness of our authors, when
asserting that Pope Nicolas I., by
torturing a single word against the
sense of a whole code of law, "managed
to give a turn to a canon of a
general council."</p>

<p>Are we to believe, upon the sole
word and authority of <i>Janus</i>, that
the whole constitution of the church
underwent a change by means of
these Isidorian decretals, when so
many men, distinguished for their
learning and deep researches, have
exploded this theory long ago advanced
by the Magdeburg Centuriators?
It is certainly nothing else
than presumption and arrogance to
disparage the knowledge and science
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>of so many eminent men,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> who unanimously
agree on the following points:
1. That the pseudo-Isidorian decretals
were not written with a view of
exalting the papal power, but rather
that of the bishops. 2. That the
contents of this collection are, for the
most part, taken from ancient and
genuine documents. 3. That the
fictitious decretals contained therein
are quite generally known, and even
these imply nothing novel or contradictory
to the then established discipline
of the church. 4. It is certain
that this collection was <i>not</i> compiled
at <i>Rome</i>, and much less known or
used by Pope Nicolas as a <i>genuine</i>
document of binding force.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to support
these points by a few and, we hope,
unexceptionable arguments. <i>Janus</i>
might have indeed spared himself the
pains of such a minute and tedious
disquisition on these Isidorian forgeries,
as many<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> of similar disposition
with himself made extensive use of
this unauthorized collection of pseudo-Isidore,
in order to show upon what
grounds were based the principles of
the present constitution of the church,
and particularly that the prerogatives
exercised by the Roman see rested
on these forged documents. If the
power of the Bishop of Rome had no
other foundation but the Isidorian
forgery, then indeed might we be
obliged to join in the triumphant
chorus of <i>Janus</i> and his abettors;
but the question, not to be misplaced
or adroitly shifted, is simply this: Did
the prerogatives exercised by the
popes need these forgeries to establish
the lawfulness of their claims?
It is to no purpose to conceal and
cover up, as it were, the principle in
question by tedious and showy digressions&mdash;whether
these decretals
were fictitious and whether they were
used; but the whole problem to be
solved is, Has the pseudo-Isidorian
collection introduced or enforced an
<i>innovation</i> in the <i>ancient</i> constitution
of the church, as it was in vigor at
that period, or were the principles
enunciated by pseudo-Isidore conformable
to the doctrine of the church
and in accordance with the canons
of former councils, or not? What
does it matter whether one or another
theologian, and even a pope,
made use of these decretals, not
doubting of their genuineness, and consequently
deceived, provided nothing
new and unwarranted by previous
tradition was thereby acknowledged
or enacted? If such a theologian as
St. Thomas Aquinas was deceived as
to a spurious passage of St. Cyril,
and followed herein by Bellarmine,
is that enough to condemn their
whole system or to impeach their
honesty?</p>

<p>We might by such a method of
arguing overthrow the entire historical
edifice of the first thousand years
of the church, and begin to build up
a new system on this <i>tabula rasa</i> with
the aid of this hypercritical process
of <i>Janus</i> and his school, and we
scarcely doubt but that he himself
would be in the worst plight.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that the author
of the Isidorian decretals, as he himself
avows in the preface, wished to
give a complete code of ecclesiastical
laws to the clergy, though for the
greater part he insists on such points
of discipline as were at that time
greatly endangered and often neglected.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The immediate object," says <i>Janus</i>,
"of the compiler of this forgery was to
protect bishops against their metropolitans
and other authorities, so as to secure absolute
impunity." (P. 77.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span></p>

<p>This should be effected, of course,
by the right of appealing to Rome,
and, consequently, making the pope
the supreme judge of all the bishops
and clergy, that is, of the entire
church. These are the principles
that worked their way and became
dominant; and that they "revolutionized
the whole constitution of the
church, introducing a new system in
place of the old on that point," our
authors assert "there can be no controversy
among candid historians."
(P. 79.) With all deference to the
historical erudition of our authors, we
cannot refrain from interrogating history
and assuring ourselves of the
truth of these grave charges.</p>

<p>Having once granted that Christ
intrusted Peter and his successors
with the chief care of his flock&mdash;both
pastors and people&mdash;it is impossible
to suppose that in this supreme
charge should not be included the
right of hearing appeals and giving
final decision; for where could this
preÃ«minence find any application, if
the whole church be thus cut off
from communicating with its head?</p>

<p>The Synod of Sardica had formally
defined this right of hearing appeals
in several of its canons, as our authors
acknowledge, though their efforts
to cancel this ancient testimony
and to do away with the binding
force of these canons are useless and
unavailing; for the canons of the
Council of Sardica<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> did nothing more
than solemnly acknowledge what had
been handed down from <i>apostolic</i>
times, attesting the doctrine of the
church as fully practised long before.
We may be permitted to signalize
two most remarkable and indubitable
instances from history. Marcianus,
Bishop of Arles, having espoused the
heretical doctrine of Novatian, was
denounced by Faustinus of Lyons,
and other bishops, to the see of Rome;
at the same time Faustinus also informed
St. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage,
who, in his turn, begged Pope
Stephen to terminate this affair by
his power as supreme pastor of the
church, requesting the deposition of
Marcianus and the appointment of
another in his place.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Another no
less conspicuous proof we find in the
fact of the two Spanish bishops, Basilides
and Martial, in which case St.
Cyprian<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> approved of the action of
Pope Stephen, and saw no usurpation
of power when the latter restored
Basilides to his bishopric, and only
regretted that by a false statement
of facts the pope was misled and deceived.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
Our argument becomes
more conclusive from the following
great event in the eastern church,
where the jurisdiction in the <i>greater
causes (causÃ¦ majores)</i> appears in
most resplendent light. In the case
of Athanasius, Archbishop of Alexandria,
when the Eusebians,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> supported
by the weak and tyrannical Emperor
Constantius, drove him from his
episcopal see, we find, first, that a
numerous assembly of Egyptian bishops
who met at Alexandria appealed
to Pope Julius I. After the Arian
Synod of Antioch in 314, Gregory,
a Cappadocian, was forced on the
episcopal see of Athanasius, and the
latter, with the Bishops Marcellus of
Ancyra, Lucius of Adrianople, Asclepas
of Gaza, Paul of Constantinople,
and many others, fled to Rome, imploring
the protection of Pope Julius,
who caused a synod to be held
in 343, at which a great number of
<i>eastern</i> prelates from Thrace, C&oelig;lÃ©syria,
Ph&oelig;nicia, and Palestine attended.
The case of St. Athanasius
and his fellow-exiles was examined,
and they were declared innocent of
the charges brought against them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span>and reinstated in their sees, from
which only violence and force kept
them for some time. Here, then, we
have another argument for these high
prerogatives exercised by the Bishop
of Rome <i>four years before</i> the Synod
of Sardica. Confront this fact with
the following passage from our authors:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Only after the Sardican Council, and in
reliance solely on it, or the Nicene, which was
designedly confounded with it, was a right
of hearing appeals laid claim to."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We have to deal with men of far
too <i>evasive</i> minds, in the authors of
this "contribution to ecclesiastical
history," to limit ourselves to any one
point of their argumentation. If, on
the one hand, we adduce from history
long <i>before the existence</i> of the Isidorian
forgeries, the testimony of such
great and holy popes as Innocent I.,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
Zozimus,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Boniface I.,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Celestine I.,
Leo the Great,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Gelasius I.,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and even
before, Julius I.,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> (337 to 352,) who
all claim, assert, and exercise the right
of final decision as supreme judges
for both east and west, from whom
there is no appeal, and this, too, in
all great and weighty matters, (<i>graviora
negotia</i>,) as Pope Gelasius says;
then we are told that this right rests
only on the canons of Sardica, and
that the "fathers gave the see of Rome
the privilege of final decision." If, on
the other hand, we show ourselves
satisfied with so ancient and indubitable
an authority as the great Synod
of Sardica, why, then, does <i>Janus</i>
resort to the simple <i>expedient</i> of declaring
that the "Sardican canons
were never received at all in the east"?
Nor can his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mot</i>, in styling <i>greater
causes</i> (in which final decision is reserved
to the Roman see) an "elastic
term," supply the want of logic and
historical accuracy. A slight acquaintance
with the historical incidents connected
with the Council of Sardica<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
will at once convince every unbiased
mind that the opposition came from
a party of reckless Eusebians, who
withdrew from the synod when they
could not attain their nefarious object,
and repaired to Philippolis in order to
crown their treacherous proceeding by
excommunicating such holy and illustrious
prelates as Athanasius and the
aged Hosius, legate of Pope Julius,
and even the pontiff himself, who remained
steadfast in their defence of
the Nicene doctrines. And such are
the reasons, let it be observed, which
cause <i>Janus</i> to say that the canons
of Sardica were not at all received in
the east. What can be a more convincing
proof than their insertion into
collections or codes of law compiled
by official authority,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> having been inserted
not only in the Latin collection
of Dionysius,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> under the pontificate
of Anastasius II., about the year 498,
and later in the Spanish code called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Canonum</i>, commonly attributed
to Isidore of Seville, but also in the
<i>Greek</i> collection of canons by John
Scholasticus, and in the <i>Nomocanon</i>
compiled by the same author, who
died Patriarch of Constantinople in
578.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>From these premises we arrive at
the following conclusions: 1st, that
the right of appeal to Rome and her
jurisdiction, in all <i>greater causes</i>, was
taught and practised in the church at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span><i>least</i> four centuries before the Isidorian
decretals were known; 2d, that
the jurisdiction of the pope as supreme
judge of the whole church is triumphantly
attested by historical documents
of the same age; 3d, that the
canons of Sardica acknowledged a
<i>divine</i> right of the bishops of Rome&mdash;merely
introducing a new <i>form</i> that
affected the <i>application</i> and <i>exercise</i> of
this right, from which, however, the
popes could deviate for reasons of
wise and prompt administration.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>In this connection we must briefly
notice another charge made by <i>Janus</i>,
namely, that on the fabrication
of pseudo-Isidore,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"was based the maxim that the pope, as
supreme judge of the church, could be judged
by no man." (P. 78.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In this maxim our authors discover
the foundation of the edifice of papal
infallibility already laid. If such be
the case, let us inquire whether this
maxim was not known before pseudo-Isidore.
A synod of Rome held in
378, under Pope Damasus, declared
in a letter to the Emperor Gratian<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
that it was sanctioned by ancient custom
that the Bishop of Rome, since
his case was not submitted to a general
council, should answer for himself
before the council of the emperor;
<i>but this was only to be understood in
accusations of civil and political offences</i>.
The highest judicial authority in the
church having been vested by Christ
in Peter and his successors, their voice
was the judgment from which there
was no appeal; neither did any bishop
or any assembly of bishops receive
power over the head of the church.
This principle, acknowledged by civil
codes in temporal principalities, was
likewise solemnly affirmed by the Roman
synod in the year 501, which
was called by King Theodoric to examine
the complaints brought against
Pope Symmachus, and to judge him
accordingly. But behold the declaration
of the assembled bishops, protesting
that it belonged to the bishop
of the apostolic chair of Peter to convene
a synod; for it was a thing unheard
of that the high-priest of the
aforesaid see should be placed in
judgment before his own subjects.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
The bishops pronounced that he was
innocent before men, and left all to
the tribunal of God. An apology,
written for this Roman synod by the
Deacon Ennodius,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> afterward Bishop
of Pavia, declared that a council on
the more important affairs could be
assembled only by the pope, or at
least must be confirmed by him. Another
striking passage illustrating this
principle is to be found in the letter
of Avitus, Bishop of Vienne, addressed
to the senators of the city of Rome
in the name of the bishops of Gaul, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That the pope, as superior, could be
judged by no one according to reason or
law; and that if this privilege of the pope
be called in question, the whole episcopacy
would be shaken."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Janus</i> likewise lets Pope Nicolas
assert, on the strength of the Isidorian
forgery, "that the Roman Church
keeps the faith pure, and is free from
every stain." (P. 80.) Now, who does
not know that beautiful testimony of
St. IrenÃ¦us, according to which "the
whole church, that is, all the faithful,
must be in union with this church, on
account of its more powerful principality;
in which communion the faithful
of the whole world have preserved
the tradition that was handed down
by the apostles"?<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span></p>

<p>That the words in question employed
by St. IrenÃ¦us, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter potentiorem
principalitatem</i>, are by no means capable
of the construction as meaning
<i>greater antiquity</i>, is clearly demonstrated
by Dr. DÃ¶llinger.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> St. IrenÃ¦us
likewise concludes from the uninterrupted
succession of bishops in the
Church of Rome by saying, "When,
therefore, you know the faith of this
church, you have learned the faith of
the others." St. Cyprian, too, uses the
following expressive language, "He
who does not preserve the unity of
this church, how can he hold the
faith?"<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>Theodoret, about the year 440, calls
the Roman see</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That most holy see which possesses the
supremacy of the churches in the whole
world, in virtue of many privileges, and
above all others, of this one, that she has always
remained free <i>from the stain of heresy</i>;
nor has any one had possession of it holding
any thing contrary to faith, but she has
preserved entire this apostolic privilege!"<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
"Nec ullus fidei contraria sentiens in illa
sedit, sed apostolicum gratiam integram
servavit."</p></blockquote>

<p>We might multiply our references<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
on this point to exhibit the <i>historical</i>
fabrications of <i>Janus</i> and his school;
but we trust that all judicious and
discriminating minds will have come
to the conclusion, from the testimonies
already adduced, that the pseudo-Isidorian
principles have neither changed
nor <i>revolutionized</i> the <i>ancient</i> constitution
of the church, and that the
papal prerogatives, at which our authors
seem so very much incensed,
did not stand in need of forgeries&mdash;least
of all, of those that came from
the "Isidorian workshop;" and we,
at the same time, apprehend that they
will have to go further back&mdash;perhaps
to the apostolic fathers&mdash;to trace <i>another</i>
history of the constitution of the
church and the prerogatives claimed
by the successors of St. Peter.</p>

<p>As to the materials from which
these Isidorian decretals were formed,
we may briefly state that they were
ancient documents to which the author
had access. In many instances
he attributes some <i>genuine</i> letters of
popes to others than their real authors,
and many other spurious documents
had already been inserted
in private collections, as the brothers
Ballerini have demonstrated
most clearly by their profound researches.
Sixteen pieces of this kind
are enumerated by them.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> According
to the most ancient code, this
collection of pseudo-Isidore is divided
into three parts, as we find in the
<cite>Codex Vaticanus</cite>, n. 630, recorded by
Ballerini; and in more recent times,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
this codex being brought into the library
of Paris, Camus compared it
again with four other manuscript <i>codices</i>.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
Part I. comprises the fifty
apostolic canons which were compiled
about the time of the Council of
Chalcedon, as is generally supposed;
fifty-nine spurious letters of the first
thirty popes, from Clement to Melchiades;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
the introduction to the
whole is taken partly from the old
Spanish collection, which circulated
under the name of St. Isidore, Bishop
of Seville. Part II. gives, after a
brief preface, the false act of donation
by the Emperor Constantine;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>two introductory pieces, one taken
from the <i>Spanish</i> code, the other from
the <i>Gallic</i> code;<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> lastly, the acts of
Greek, African, Gallic, and Spanish
councils, as the Spanish code of the
year 683 recorded them. In the third
part we find another introduction copied
from the Spanish collection, and
then follow in order of time the decretals
of the popes, from Sylvester
(died 335) to Gregory II., (died 731.)
Among these latter there are thirty-five
<i>forged</i> letters and several false
councils, though, let it be clearly understood,
in many portions the <i>contents</i>
of these forged decretals corresponded
to <i>genuine</i> documents which
the author extracted for this purpose.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
Two councils are falsely attributed to
Pope Symmachus. All these records
of pseudo-Isidore cover the whole
field of ecclesiastical discipline; they
are partly dogmatical, directed against
the errors of the Arians, Nestorians,
and Monophysites; partly they contain
moral precepts and exhortations;
partly they refer to liturgy, giving the
accompanying ceremonies to the administration
of the sacraments; another
no less conspicuous part is the
enactments of papal decrees and canons
of councils, regarding the protection
of the clergy against arbitrary
oppression, accusations, and depositions,
the security of ecclesiastical
property, the dignity and rights of
the Roman Church, the appeals to
the apostolic see, and the prerogatives
of patriarchs, metropolitans, and bishops.
From all this we can infer,
that the object of the author in compiling
this code was a very comprehensive
one, and he drew quite copiously
from the Scriptures, from the
Roman pontifical book,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> the historical
books of Rufinus<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and Cassiodorus,
the author of the <cite>Historia
Tripartita</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> also from the writings
of the Latin fathers, and from many
collections or commentaries of Roman
law. By a subsequent multiplying
of copies, several changes and additions
were made during the eleventh
and twelfth centuries.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Having already produced testimonies
to prove that the principles&mdash;which
are said to have "surely but
gradually changed the ancient constitution
of the church" by means of
these Isidorian fictions&mdash;were known
and acknowledged long <i>before</i> pseudo-Isidore,
we have thereby made good
our third point, and we can fully concur
in the following conclusion of a
learned historian, who says of the
pseudo-Isidorian code:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Had his book been in open variance
with the chief points of the prevailing discipline,
it would at once have awakened suspicion;
examinations would have been instituted,
and in an age which possessed critical
acumen sufficient to detect the falsity
of the title of a book (the <cite>Hypognosticon</cite>)
which was circulated under the name of St.
Augustine, the imposition would have been
detected&mdash;an imposition which, such as it
really was, lay concealed, because the principles
and laws of ecclesiastical discipline
of the age corresponding with the contents
of the work, they excited no surprise."</p></blockquote>

<p>That the Isidorian collection was
not compiled at Rome, is admitted
by all historians<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and canonists of
any standing;<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> nor did <i>Janus</i> dare to
revive an antiquated and unfounded
opinion of this import. However, we
have to deal with another no less hazardous,
nay, we might state at once,
<i>false</i> assertion in the following lines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"About a hundred pretended decrees of
the earliest popes, together with certain spurious
writings of other church dignitaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>and acts of synods, were then fabricated in
the west of Gaul, and <i>eagerly seized upon by
Pope Nicolas I. at Rome</i>,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> to be used as
genuine documents in support of the <i>new</i>
claims put forward by himself and his successors."
(P. 77.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to judge fairly of this
whole question raised by <i>Janus</i>, and
by others before him, we may be pardoned
for premising that the collection
of pseudo-Isidore became first
known in Gaul about the middle of
the ninth century. The most recent
document which has been traced is
the Synod of Paris, of 829, from
which extracts are made. Other researches
have led Ballerini<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and others
to suppose that the Synod of Aix-la-Chapelle,
held in the year 836, was
known to the author, since he dwells
at great length on the rights of primates
or apostolic vicars, which dignity
was restored in France, or western
Gaul, after a long interruption, in
the year 844. Mention is first made
of these decretals at the Synod of
ChiÃ¨ssy,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> in 857, so that the time of
their compilation must certainly be
assigned between these last-named
dates of 845 and 847. We might arrive
at a more precise time by the
fact that a collection of <i>Capitularies</i>,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
made by Benedict, <i>levita</i> or deacon
of Mainz, between the years 840 and
847, contains entire passages <i>identical</i>
with those in the pseudo-Isidorian
code. The only explanation of this
similarity is either to be sought in the
fact that both collections come from
the same author, or that the Capitularies
of Benedict have copied from
the Isidorian code; and in that issue,
the latter must have been compiled
before the year 847.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The correspondence
between Pope Nicolas I.
and Hincmar of Rheims attracted
general attention to the pseudo-Isidorian
collection, and in this way Pope
Nicolas I. was first apprised of their
existence, as is evident from his letter
to the bishops of Gaul,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> where he
upholds the authority of the papal
decretals in general, independently of
their insertion in any collection. The
pope mentions the sources from which
the Roman Church took its ecclesiastical
discipline, alluding to the codex
of Dionysius. The objection usually
brought forward, that the pope says
that these decretals were preserved in
the <i>archives of the Roman Church</i>,
does not refer to the pseudo-Isidorian
decretals, since there is only question
of the authority to be attributed to
those documents in general.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Hincmar,
who had previously appealed to
the pseudo-Isidorian collection, later
rejected the authority of those decretals
which seemed to condemn his
own views and position in the affair
with Hincmar, Bishop of Laon.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> To
leave no doubt on this head in the
mind of the reader, we submit the
very words of Nicolas I.:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We do not unreasonably complain," (addressing
the bishops of Gaul,) "that you
have set aside the decrees of several bishops
of the apostolic see in this matter. Far be
it from us of not receiving with due honor
either the decretals or other enactments concerning
ecclesiastical discipline, all of which
the holy Roman Church has preserved and
given over to our care, retaining them previously
in her archives and in ancient and
genuine monuments."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A few lines further the same pope
exhibits the inconsistency of Hincmar
and other bishops, when acknowledging
only such decretals as favor their
own position, and rejecting others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>merely because they were not found
in the code known to themselves.
The principle, as though the authority
of a decree of the popes or a synod
was not to be recognized unless it
has been received into some code,
is combated and the whole issue
comes to this, whether such decrees
are authentic and genuine. In fine,
the pope in this epistle combines an
extraordinary knowledge of the ancient
canons with great force of logic
and historical accuracy. Our conclusion
is that Pope Nicolas I. has
never appealed to the pseudo-Isidorian
decretals, though he frequently
had occasion to do so. This is admitted
by the reformed preacher
Blondel,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> and by Blasco,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and, among
other modern historians, by Dr. DÃ¶llinger,
who remarks that Pope Nicolas
I. "makes no use of the Isidorian
collection, adduces none of its decretals,
and it may be even doubted
whether he had seen the work."<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
During the eleventh century only, the
popes begin to quote from pseudo-Isidore.
Here, then, we have given
another specimen of the "historical
fairness" and "canonical erudition"
of <i>Janus</i> and associates; and if our
authors imagined that it was enough
to <i>impose</i> on their readers by the mass
of "original authorities," they have
indeed succeeded to some extent,
and we have but one restriction to
make, that is, that they cannot be
saved from the charge of <i>deliberate
falsification</i>. For, singularly enough,
and much to the credit of the historical
erudition of <i>Janus</i>, let it be remarked
that there is always something
in the authorities quoted bearing on
the point under discussion. Who is
there who does not see that <i>Janus</i>
stamps himself as a falsifier of history,
whenever he mutilates and distorts
the contents of authorities quoted by
him? In conclusion, we wish to allude
to one more insidious passage
of our authors, when they say,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The spurious character of the Isidorian
decretals had been exposed by the Magdeburg
Centuriators, and no one with any
knowledge of Christian antiquity could retain
a doubt of their being a later fabrication."
(P. 319.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Alas! Nothing easier than to claim
this merit for such <i>candid</i> and <i>impartial</i>
historians as the avowed champions
of Lutheranism! Besides the
doubts entertained by Hincmar and
other bishops in the ninth century,
a writer of the twelfth century, Peter
Comestor,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> called the genuineness
of this collection in question.
In the middle of the fifteenth century,
the learned Cardinal Nicolas
Cusanus<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> and such an eminent divine
as John de Turrecremata<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> proved the
fictitious character of the most ancient
papal decretals contained in
pseudo-Isidore; they were followed
in these investigations by other eminent
scholars, both in Germany and
France, <i>before</i> the dawn of the sixteenth
century, and hence no trophies
on this field could have been won
by the <i>historians</i> of Magdeburg!</p>

<p>If, notwithstanding all these elucidations,
a certain Jesuit, Turrianus, wrote
in defence of the pseudo-Isidorian
decretals, we do not see how from
this fact <i>Janus</i> concludes that the "Jesuit
order were resolved to defend
them." (P. 319.) Did not the illustrious
Jesuit Bellarmine acknowledge
the fictitious character of pseudo-Isidore?
And yet our authors thus
boldly continue as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Bellarmine acknowledged that without
the forgeries of the pseudo-Isidore, ... it
would be impossible to make out even a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>semblance of traditional evidence." (P.
319.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We are sorry to say that we have
not been able to discover any such
admission on the part of Cardinal
Bellarmine; but on the contrary,
when answering the objection of the
Centuriators concerning the fictitious
letters of the first thirty popes to
Melchiades, we find the following
clear view on this subject:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although I do not deny that some errors
have slipped into these letters, nor do
I dare to claim for them undoubted authority,
yet I doubt not but that they are of
very ancient origin."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was not precisely on the faith of
the Isidorian collection or its compiler
that Bellarmine used any of these
documents; but he endeavored to
demonstrate their authenticity according
to the rules laid down by historical
criticism. It is simply false that
he made "copious use of the Isidorian
fictions." None deserve greater
credit for the clear and elaborate
elucidation of this great question
of pseudo-Isidore than the brothers
Ballerini, who have supplied an immense
material whence the eminent
canonists and historians of our days
have been enabled to weigh every
thing carefully, and the result has
been a glorious one to <i>Catholic</i> learning
and science. The attempts which
have been made for three hundred
years, and more, to create a fictitious
foundation for the present constitution
of the Catholic Church, and to
brand it with the specious appellation
of <i>forgery</i>&mdash;these inglorious attempts,
we say, have in our days
been renewed by <i>Janus</i> and his deluded
admirers. If <i>Janus</i> hoped to
strengthen his position by a novel
method, we dare assert his signal
failure&mdash;indeed, our enemies have secured
a poor and feeble leader. Should
the present contribution produce further
curiosity, and lead to more extended
and serious researches on this
subject, we are confident enough to
express the hope that many unfounded
prejudices will be thereby dispelled,
and the triumph of <i>ancient</i> and
<i>present</i> Catholic doctrine be hastened.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<h2>THE SUPERSTITION OF UNBELIEF.</h2>


<p>When an age has abandoned God,
sensuality delivers it over, like Faust,
to the devil, and he becomes its deity.
Unbelief is everywhere followed by
superstition. Where the gods are
not, the demons reign, says a modern
German poet. "We are ready
to believe every thing when we believe
nothing," remarks Chateaubriand.
"We have augurs when we
have no longer prophets; witchcraft
when we have no longer religious ceremonies.
When the temples of God
are closed, the caves of the sorcerers
are opened."</p>

<p>It is certainly a monstrous pairing
when, with boasted enlightenment,
fortune-telling, card-divining, and the
other superstitions of darkness go hand
in hand. But it is nevertheless an old
and well-known fact-one constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
demonstrated by human experience&mdash;that
unbelief is invariably associated
with the grossest superstition. A rapid
glance at the history of peoples
in all other essentials most widely differing
from each other will readily
prove this.</p>

<p>Beginning with the Hindoos, the
oldest people on the earth, we find that
A. W. Schlegel has already effectually
refuted the theories of modern writers
on religion by demonstrating to us
a steady retrogression from the spiritual
to the sensual, from belief to unbelief
and superstition. Dubois, who
had spent thirty years among the
Brahmins, and studied their philosophy,
traces the degrading superstition
into which the Hindoos have lapsed
to their having lost faith in the religion
of their ancestors. Once their
schools taught the maxim, Before
earth, water, air, wind, fire, Brahma,
Vishnu, Chieva, sun, and stars, there
was the only and eternal God, who
had sprung out of himself. These
pure ideas of religion have long been
abandoned for an atheistic materialism.
A superstitious demonology,
spirit-raising, sorcery, and magic have
grown out of this unbelief, and the same
people now adore Kapel, the serpent,
and Gamda, the bird. They observe
annually a feast in honor of Darhba,
an ordinary weed, and offer up sacrifices
to spade and pick. To kill a
cow is by them considered a crime
more heinous than matricide, and their
philosophers esteem it a great piece
of good luck, a sure passport to paradise,
if they can catch hold of a cow
by the tail instead of the head, when
dying. "Modern materialism," observes
Dr. HÃ¦ffner, comparing the
unbelief of the Hindoos with our own,
"has closely approached the abyss
of Buddhism." Manifestations like
Mormonism, or the spiritualism of
New York, Paris, and Berlin, already
suggest to us the religious and moral
practices of the Hindoos, and we bid
fair soon to reach their lowest and
vilest forms&mdash;the Lamaism of Thibet
and Ceylon. As in the opening of the
present century, admiration of genius
led men to adore the poetical genius
of Schiller and Goethe, so, changing
their idols, they will eventually worship
those who have deified matter.
The Buddhas of modern atheism can
only be the materialistic notabilities
of the day; and for this reason a humorous
writer recommends Carl Vogt
for Delai-Lama, he being not only a
high scientific but a great political authority.</p>

<p>Passing from the east to the west,
we find, and especially in Roman history,
that the increase of superstition
has steadily kept pace with the diminution
of faith. The religious decadence
of ancient Rome dates from the
close of the Punic wars and the domestic
commotions of the republic, at
which period we first notice that
strange hankering after what is obscure
and mysterious in paganism, and
which attained its zenith under the
CÃ¦sars. This remark applies, however,
more to the cities than the country;
for, from the days of Augustus
down to those of the Antonines, the
latter had not yet been so generally
corrupted as the former. Sulla, the
dictator&mdash;to cite a few examples&mdash;put
the utmost confidence in a small image
of Apollo, brought from Delphi, which
he carried about on his person, and
which he embraced publicly before his
troops with a prayer for victory. Augustus,
who allowed himself to be
worshipped as a god in the provinces,
regarded it as an evil omen to be
handed the left shoe instead of the
right when he rose in the morning.
He neither set out on a journey after
the Nundines nor undertook any
thing of importance during the Nones.
When one of his fleets had been lost
at sea, he punished Neptune by excluding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span>
his image from being carried
in procession at the Circensian games.</p>

<p>After the doctrine of Polybius, that
religion is nothing more than a tissue
of lies and traditions, began to prevail
at Rome, the phenomena which usually
attend the decadence of a people
became plainly apparent. Those who
are familiar with the epidemic capers
of the fanatics of that age, who jerked
their heads and distorted their limbs
while pretending to utter the will of
the gods, will be reminded of that
moral and religious degradation which
has produced the same effects in all
countries and times&mdash;effects distinctly
visible among all Christian peoples
into whose life the ancient heathenism
still enters, or where false civilization
once more tends to barbarism. The
story of Alexander of Obonoteichos
shows the extremes to which superstition
may lead men. This audacious
impostor buried in the temple
of Apollo, at Chalcedon, but so that
they could be easily found, a set of
bronze tablets, promising that Esculapius
and his father Apollo would
shortly come to Obonoteichos. He
also secreted an egg containing a
small snake, and mounted the next
day the altar in the market-place to
proclaim as one inspired that Esculapius
was about to appear. He produced
the egg, broke its shell, and
the people rejoiced over the god who
had assumed the form of a serpent.
The news of this miracle attracted
immense crowds. A few days later,
Alexander announced that the serpent-god
had already reached maturity,
and he exhibited himself to the public
in a partially darkened room, dressed
as a prophet, with a large tame serpent&mdash;secretly
imported from Macedonia&mdash;so
twisted around his waist
that its head was out of sight, and
its place supplied by a human head
of paper, whence protruded a black
tongue. This new serpent-god, Glykon,
the youngest Epiphany of Esculapius,
received the honors of temple
and oracle service. Alexander became
a highly respected prophet;
Rutelia, a noble Roman, married his
daughter, and the prefect Severian
asked him for an oracle on taking the
field against the king of the Parthians.</p>

<p>If we wish to see how the same
impostures are reÃ«nacted in our own
times, we need only read the accounts
of certain evening amusements at the
Tuileries. There sat one night the
Emperor Napoleon III., the Empress
Eugenie, the Duke de Montebello,
and Home, the medium. On a table
before them were paper, pens, and
ink. Then appeared a spirit-hand,
which picked up a pen, dipped it into
the ink, and wrote the name of Napoleon
I. in Napoleon's handwriting.
The emperor prayed to be permitted
to kiss the spirit-hand, which advanced
to his lips, and then to those of
Eugenie. This <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sÃ©ance</i>, and one of
a similar kind at the Palais Royal,
where the Red Prince, known for his
hatred of the church, devoutly watched
the ball which Home caused to
move over a table, remind us involuntarily
of the Jesus-contemning apostate
Emperor Julian, as he followed
Maximus, the Neo-Platonist, into a
subterranean vault for the purpose of
seeing Hecate, and looking credulously
on when the former secretly set fire
to a figure of Hecate, painted in combustible
materials on the wall, and at
the same time let fly a falcon with
burning tow tied to his feet. Fuller
information on this subject the curious
may glean from the stories published
in the French journals, of hands
growing out of table-tops and sofa-cushions,
which furnish the Paris <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã©lite</i>
with the only luxury of terror it seems
still capable of enjoying; or they may
consult the numerous patrons of the
fashionable clairvoyants and physiognomists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span>
the Mesdames Villeneuve, of
the Rue St. Denis, as well as the successors
of Lenormand, the famous coffee-grounds
seer, toward whom Napoleon
I. felt himself irresistibly attracted,
(though he sent the luckless
Cassandra occasionally to prison,) and
whom the Empress Josephine held
in high esteem.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century furnishes
some striking illustrations of our theory.
An epidemic tendency to unbelief,
like that which characterizes this
century, is without precedent since
the dawn of Christianity. Its fruits
recall the worst abuses of the ManichÃ¦ans
and the Albigenses. We do
not here allude to the thousands of
innocent superstitions, which Grimm
says are a sort of religion for minor
domestic purposes, and may be met
with in all ages, but to those more
glaring ones which show how inseparable
are an arrogant unbelief and the
grossest superstition. Hobbes, who
labored already in the seventeenth
century to undermine the Christian
religion, was so afraid of ghosts that
he would not pass the night without
candles. D'Alembert, the chief of the
EncyclopÃ¦dists, used to leave the table
when thirteen sat down to it. The
Marquis D'Argens was frightened out
of his wits at the upsetting of a salt-cellar.
Frederick II. had faith in astrology.
At the court of his successor,
General Bishopswerder imposed
on the king by magic tricks, and his accomplice,
WÃ¶llner, who raised spirits
by the agency of optic mirrors, became
minister. The custodian of the
National Library at Paris related to
Count Portalis that some time previous
to the great revolution books on
fortune-telling and the black arts were
in general demand. Oerstedt speaks
of a man who paraded his atheism
with great insolence, but whom nothing
could have tempted to pass
through a graveyard after dark. Napoleon
I. dispatched, in 1812, a special
messenger to Beyreuth, with instructions
not to be lodged in the
apartments which the "white woman"
of the Hohenzollerns was reputed
to haunt. In the same way
we see by the side of this league of
unbelieving philosophers spring up
such superstitious sects as the Butlerians,
whose head, Margaret Butler,
with Justus Winter for God the Father,
and George Oppenzoller for God the
Son, represented herself to be the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>The alleged miraculous cures on the
grave of Paris, the Jansenist deacon,
in the first, and the exorcisms of the
devil by Gassner, in the second half
of the eighteenth century, form another
instructive chapter in the history
of superstition. While the Archbishop
of Vontimiglii, the Bishop of
Sens, and other distinguished prelates,
denounced the cures performed
with the earth from the grave of Paris
as a cheat, Montegon, the atheist,
wrote three volumes to prove their
authenticity. While the Archbishop
of Prague and the papal chair, by a
decree of the Congregation of Rites
issued in October, 1777, condemned
the miraculous pretensions of Gassner,
Walter, Leitner, and other deistic physicians,
upheld them. While the mountebank
Cagliostro, who pretended to
have learnt in Egypt the secret of generating
magical powers from reflecting
surfaces, was called to account at
Rome, the Free-Masons of Holland
made him visitator, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fÃªted</i> him in
their lodges. The unbelief of the
eighteenth century reached at last its
culminating point during the French
revolution in the abolishment of the
Supreme Being, though the rites of
Mlle. Aubry or Mme. Momoro were
as silly as the worship of the cotton
plucked from Voltaire's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">robe de chambre</i>.
The names in the philosophical
calendar remind us strongly of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span>
Hindoo worship of the spade and
pick, and who knows but some super-enlightened
atheist may be prepared
to subscribe to the Brahminic dogma
about the ox, an animal which has
already played a prominent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rÃ´le</i> at
a red-republican festival? Burke's
prediction has been fulfilled, "If we
discard Christianity, a coarse, ruinous,
degrading superstition will replace it."</p>

<p>This war against faith and every
thing spiritual has continued into the
nineteenth century, until once more
gross materialism is found on every
side. Already, during the fourth decade,
the darkest superstition threatened
to overwhelm the so-called intelligent
world with the manifestations
of magnetism. The campaign against
the supernatural opened with the trial
of the devil. As the Strasbourg <cite>Catholic</cite>
satirically observed, the very
day and hour had been fixed when it
was required that he should establish
his own existence by tangible proof.
Disregarding the summons, the scamp
was promptly declared <i>in contumaciam</i>
outlawed and cashiered along with the
entire host of unclean spirits. The
same summary mode of treatment
was pursued with the opposite side,
and the same judgment was passed
on the angels, cherubim, and seraphim.
All were pronounced to be equally
tasteless, scentless, inaudible, and imponderable,
and declared to be mere
creatures of the imagination. Their
Lord and Master was next put on trial;
at first very considerately with closed
doors and in a secret inquisitorial manner.
The results of the trial were put on
record, and for a while imparted only
to the initiated, who gradually divulged
the news to the masses. At last
the spirituality of our own soul was
arraigned, and its activity explained
as the result of a mere change of matter.
The Beelzebub of ancient superstition
was thus exorcised and expelled;
but he soon returned to the house
which the besom of criticism had
cleaned, and brought back with him
seven other evil spirits, so that nothing
was gained by the proceeding. The
age, having cut loose from the invisible,
naturally plunged into a most abject
dependence on the visible. As
the negro races kneel before their fetiches,
trees and serpents, so this century
kneels before sleeping somnambulists,
dancing and writing tables,
and mixtures and nostrums from the
apothecary shop.</p>

<p>Should civilization much longer continue
on the present road, the most
deplorable consequences must follow.
As in all former times, so in this age
unbelief has led where it always
will lead&mdash;to superstition. Man, created
for immortality, needs the wonderful,
a future, and hope. When such
a sceptical enlightenment as distinguishes
modern philosophy has sapped
the foundations of religion, its absence
leaves in his thoughts and feelings an
immeasurable void which invites the
most dangerous phantoms of the brain.
The moment man boldly declares, "I
no longer believe in any thing," he is
preparing to believe in all things. It
is high time that so-called philosophy
should again draw near to that religion
which it has misunderstood, and
which alone is capable of giving to
the emotions of the heart a generous
impulse and a safe direction.</p>

<h2>REFORMATORIES FOR BOYS.&mdash;METTRAY.</h2>


<p>It needs but a slight glance at the
condition of things around us to discover,
as a consequence of the criminal
and most deplorable neglect of
the moral education of a large proportion
of our children, that if they
be not already on the broad road to
ruin, they give, at least, little hope of
becoming useful members of society.
This remark is intended chiefly, but
not exclusively, for boys, whose constantly
increasing lawlessness, connected
with the steady growth of
crime among us, cannot fail to awaken
the most serious apprehensions in the
mind of every attentive observer of
passing events, while nothing adequate
to the emergency is offered to
check this growing evil; yet on the
children of the present generation are
based our hopes for the future of our
country. Every one knows with
what facility these young, fresh minds
may be guided toward what is truly
good; for, though the tendency of
our human nature to the descending
scale in morals as well as in physics
is sufficiently evident, the one may be
counteracted with almost as much
certainty as the other, if judicious
measures be early taken to give them
a right direction. The writer has
had much experience in the domestic
training of boys, and yields the heartiest
adhesion to the precept, "Train
up a child in the way he should go;
and when he is old, he will not depart
from it." This training, however,
is not by means of pampering
animal appetites or self-will, but by
inculcation of strict though gentle
laws of obedience and self-denial.
These habits once acquired, a solid
basis is laid for good principles and
conduct, and these can, I venture to
say, <em>always</em> be fairly established within
the first ten years of life, which
have been justly pronounced the
most important period of human existence,
for they contain the germ
from which the future character is
formed. A profound thinker remarks,
that "in the education of the family
is concentrated the strength of the
nation;" an observation which may
well be applied to these United
States, where the moral character of
every individual, through our system
of universal suffrage, assumes a certain
weight, and thus, to a greater or
less extent, influences the best interests
of the whole country. We may
here be permitted, in view of the immense
importance of this education
of early childhood, to suggest a hint of
a strange inconsistency which is scarcely
ever noticed in the systems of education
adopted to prepare the fathers
and mothers of our posterity
for their respective callings. Everywhere,
even where <em>moral</em> influences
are neglected, means are provided
for the preparation of boys for their
career in life; yet, notwithstanding
the multitudinous volumes of philanthropy
expended upon "woman's
sphere," "her rights," etc., etc., we
have scarcely heard of a single well-directed
effort, beyond the <i>chances</i>
of the domestic circle, to educate
young women in the supreme, the
inexpressibly momentous knowledge
of the vocation that must surely be
the lot of nearly every one of them.
They are destined to be mothers&mdash;to
train up tender minds for time and
for eternity! To them is confided
the most precious of our earthly treasures;
for what is untold gold but
dust in comparison with the well-being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span>
of our children? Why are
they not imbued with the most profound
respect for the dignity of motherhood,
as well as instructed conscientiously
in its practical duties
and responsibilities?</p>

<p>When the mother's work is ill done,
or, as is but too often the case, totally
neglected, of what avail are the
labors of the professor, but to make
a bad man intellectually strong and
more capable for the accomplishment
of his evil designs? Who can predict
the safety of the noblest structure
if superimposed on a false or insecure
foundation? Knowledge is a
power equally available for good or
evil purposes, according to the direction
given by the moral force that
applies it. May the Almighty disposer
of events teach us even at this
late day to learn wisdom from the experience
of the past. If, for example,
a single volume were prepared and
placed among the closing studies of
the course in girls' schools, embracing
instructions in the duties of woman&mdash;as
mistress of the family, as the wife,
the mother, whose highest faculties
are requisite in the early training of
children&mdash;and if the whole were
placed in so attractive a garb as to
win their love and admiration for
these womanly duties and perfections,
might we not hope that many young
and guileless minds would be gained
from the mazes of folly ever ready to
obscure their true instincts and affections?
Craving pardon for this digression,
we proceed to the primary
object of this article.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A VISIT TO THE AGRICULTURAL AND
REFORMATORY COLONY OF METTRAY,
NEAR THE CITY OF TOURS,
FRANCE.</p></blockquote>

<p>This admirable institution, which
has received the highest stamp of
public approbation in the form of
more than eighty kindred institutions
that have adopted its rules and
practice as their models, in France,
Belgium, and other countries, was
founded about thirty years since, by
the venerable M. Demetz, at that
time a distinguished magistrate, in
union with a saintly man<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> whose
honored remains repose in the neighboring
cemetery. M. Demetz still
lives to bless and guide this noble
monument of his early wisdom and
beneficence.</p>

<p>In the midst of a beautiful and
highly cultivated rural district, the
pretty village of Mettray is built in
the form of a spacious hollow square,
and consists of some twenty or thirty
detached cottages of brick, symmetrically
placed on two opposite sides
of the quadrangle, each having pendent
roofs to protect the walls. A
circular basin of running water occupies
the centre, and the open space
is planted with fine shade-trees. Between
each of the cottages there is
a gallery about thirty feet wide, and
roofed to protect from rain the plays
of the inmates of the adjoining cottages.
All are white and of two stories,
chiefly covered with climbing
vines and flowers.</p>

<p>The entrance is on the side opposite
the fine church, which, with the
school-house and grounds, fills that
portion of the spacious quadrangle.
On entering, between two houses of
larger dimensions, (one being appropriated
to the use of the director, the
other to the normal school, in which
the future teachers of Mettray are
trained in their work,) the visitor is a
little startled at the view of a large
ship with all its spars and rigging,
moored in the solid earth. This is
intended for the instruction of boys
who manifest a taste for the sea.
The view of the whole is most pleasing.
Every cottage bears an inscription
on its front, which on inspection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>makes known the interesting fact that
each building is the donation of the
individual lady or gentleman whose
name is inscribed thereon, or of some
benevolent association. Thus the
expenses of building, usually so great
as in many instances to render such
a foundation hopeless, are here readily
and piously assumed by various
benefactors. The manifest advantages
of these separate buildings, each
adapted for the occupation of some
thirty to thirty-five boys, will appear
in the sequel. In the architecture,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
all is of the simplest kind; for
it is thought best not to awaken
luxurious tastes or habits among a
class destined to earn their living by
the sweat of their brow. The boys
are not crowded together in large
masses, but enjoy a free and open
circulation of air, conducive to health
and energy; and the inmates of each
cottage are under the permanent government
of a director and sub-director,
who are regarded as the fathers
of the household, and live with
them, eating, sleeping, etc., in the
same house, and to whom the boys
become devotedly attached, and they
thus enjoy, so far as it is possible, the
blessing of the family relations. Sisters
also are there, in their separate
apartments adjacent to the church,
prepared to nurse the sick in the infirmary,
and to give their invaluable
influences and aid, especially to the
little ones, on every proper occasion.</p>

<p>The village is adapted to receive
seven hundred boys,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> from seven or
eight years of age and upward. The
"colony," as it is termed, is chiefly
agricultural, but many of the children,
from various causes, being better
adapted to indoor employments,
are applied to trades, and in winter,
when the farm work is interrupted,
all the boys are employed in the
shops, to acquire the art of manufacturing
their own tools. In these
shops, where, as we have said, the
boys are permanently associated in
separate families, they are taught to
be tailors, shoemakers, carpenters,
blacksmiths, agricultural instrument
manufacturers&mdash;in short, any or every
trade that may be made useful or
profitable.</p>

<p>In the rear of the village are the
farm buildings, the stables, cow-houses,
etc. etc., with the gymnasium and
a small pond of running water for
bathing and swimming. Further on
is the cemetery, with its alleys of cypress
and well-kept gardens, (for gardening
is a prominent branch of industry
here;) and we may well imagine
that nothing is neglected to beautify
the surroundings of the honored
tomb of their first benefactor, and of
the lowly graves of the departed who
were once their companions. Flowers&mdash;beautiful
flowers&mdash;are strewed everywhere,
and with their fragrance seem
to hallow the sacred place.</p>

<p>Neither walls nor ditches nor any
means of restraint or confinement are
resorted to for the compulsory seclusion
of these seven hundred juvenile
culprits, who have all been adjudged
as fit subjects for this penitentiary;
yet escape is so rare as to be almost
unknown. As we entered the square,
the boys, ranging from seven or eight
to twenty years of age, were enjoying
their midday recreations&mdash;leaping,
playing, laughing, or shouting at their
pleasure. Within a few minutes, at
the sound of a clarionet, their sports
suddenly ceased, and a moment later,
at a second call, they separated, each
to join his "family" at its allotted
ground, to prepare to march; and
then a lively quick-step was heard.
This was the signal of the band, composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
of their comrades most expert
in music, who had meantime taken
their post near the centre of the
square, at which the various groups,
joined by their two directors, filed
off cheerily, each to its home. The
musicians then laid aside their instruments
and hastened after their companions.
They partake of their frugal
but wholesome and cheerful meals
in the second story of their respective
cottages, accompanied by their directors,
and in the evening, when the
last repast is ended, the tables are expertly
suspended against the walls,
and a single row of hammocks, which
were laid aside after the same fashion
before breakfast, are again placed in
order for the night. The rooms are
perfectly well ventilated, and there is
a great gain in economy from this double
arrangement. After each meal
there is recreation, and the hour being
past, music again recalls each family
to the square, from which, to the
sound of lively airs, they move off in
high spirits to their various employments.
Here goes a class of farmers,
there are the gardeners, and further
on, the carters, etc. etc., all on their
way to the farm, while the lesser numbers
of shoemakers, tailors, and others
turn their steps in the direction of
their various shops, and a goodly
class wind their way to the school.
Thus the children are accustomed to
repair to their allotted labor as if on
a holiday. Music salutes their departure,
and its notes leave a joyous
impression on the mind. The lower
floors of the cottages are all occupied
as workshops.</p>

<p>From this brief sketch may be inferred
the regularity that prevails in
the colony. Every thing is done to
habituate the boys to a willing and
cheerful performance of their duty.
No harshness is permitted that might
again chill these young hearts, that
have once been abandoned to vice
before they were capable of discrimination.
The system of rewards
is quite original, and serves its purpose
admirably. For grave offences confinement
in a cell is the only punishment
found necessary. Lying is regarded
as the worst of faults.</p>

<p>Within the narrow limits prescribed
for this article it would be impossible
to give any adequate account
of an institution which, wherever it is
known, is recognized as being equalled
only by such others as most
closely obey its spirit and maxims.
Its founders have aimed, so far as
possible, to restore and cultivate the
family affections, prematurely shattered
through vicious examples, by dividing,
as we have seen, into groups
this large mass of youthful humanity,
and forming them into families under
regulations tending to establish a sincere
and lasting attachment among its
members. In their respective cottages
they live and work together, in
the interchange of mutual kindness
and regard, and are inspired with the
idea that each, in a certain sense, is
responsible for the good conduct, the
respectability, the happiness, of his
brothers. The ever-ready sympathy
and motherly counsels of the sisters
must not be forgotten. The directors
at Mettray are, thus far, laymen; but
in many other like institutions it has
been found impossible to dispense
with the aid of religious orders. In
this country we should be obliged to
have recourse to them for want of laymen
possessed of the needful qualifications;
for they must give their entire
lives to the work.</p>

<p>The success achieved by this institution
during its thirty years' existence
in the entire reformation of the youths
subjected to its wise and wholesome
discipline, is unexampled. The statistical
tables of France, unsurpassed
in exactness, inform us that an
average of 96.81% of the youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
brought up at Mettray are restored
to society, thoroughly reformed, and
continue to fulfil their parts in life as
useful citizens. They are usually detained
in the colony to the age of
twenty-one, when suitable situations
having been provided, according to
the trade of each, they are allowed to
depart. Still, a sort of guardianship
is maintained for years over those
within reach; and the young men who
find employment among the neighboring
farmers are expected to pass the
Sundays at their old home; a privilege
which they relish in the highest degree.
Nearly half their number engage
in agricultural work. Others
enter the army or navy, in both of
which several have attained honorable
distinction. Many are married,
and present good examples in domestic
life. An honorary association has
been formed, which affords additional
incentives to good conduct after leaving
Mettray. Two years of an irreproachable
life entitles each who merits
it to a diploma; and this secures
him a membership.</p>

<p>It is really difficult to do justice to
this admirable institution without being
suspected of exaggeration. To
understand the wonder-working power
of the wisdom that pervades it,
that transforms the juvenile criminal
into a sober-minded, industrious, and
devout man, it must be seen and
closely scrutinized. Christian education
has taken the place of the penal
code, and the boy is "trained in the
way he should go," on the firm basis
of religious principles of faith and practice.
The general expression beaming
on every countenance, of cheerful
confidence, even of the gentle
and affectionate temper that prevails,
affords an affecting contrast to that
of the newly-arrived boy, fresh from
the haunts of vice. His pale and
haggard looks betray evil propensities,
as well as wasted health. His
little heart is already filled with hatred,
restrained only by the fear that
he betrays, either by attempts at a
hypocritical humility or an impudent
daring. Years pass on, and this incipient
wild beast becomes benevolent,
frank, and good.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Within a few years a kindred institution
has grown up, adjoining the
village, but skilfully concealed from
the public gaze by thick shrubbery.
This is the "Paternal Home," for the
reformation of the disobedient sons
of families in the higher walks of life.
A close white wall, behind which
trees and climbing vines appear, is
pierced in the centre by an equally
close door. A small bell-pull is touched,
and the visitor enters a pretty court
laid out with flowers and shrubs.
Through this the home appears at the
distance of a few paces. We enter a
narrow hall, furnished with simple elegance.
Doors on either side lead
into small rooms, containing a bed,
table, book-case, etc. Engravings representing
some generous or noble
action adorn the walls. As the youth
becomes more docile and studious, a
singing bird in a cage is given him
for a companion; and, finally, he is
permitted to occupy two rooms. During
all this period, the boy is made
to understand that he is the object of
the tenderest affection of his family,
who inflict the greatest pain upon
their own feelings in subjecting him
to this temporary punishment, which
is solely for his own good. Professors
attend him, and continue, without interruption,
the collegiate course which
has been interrupted, and he has the
daily benefit of fresh air on foot, or
on horseback, attended by a professor.</p>

<p>It must be understood that this sojourn
at the Paternal Home is unknown
to all but the family. M.
Demetz alone is made acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
his name.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> To others who approach
him, he is simply Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;, B&mdash;&mdash;,
or C&mdash;&mdash;. Gradually this isolation
produces its effects&mdash;and the intractable
spirit in this seclusion begins to meditate,
to reflect, to examine himself&mdash;to
condemn his former vices, and
to love the studies that alleviate
the weariness of solitude. Two or
three months usually suffice to effect
this favorable change. He finds relief
in occupation, and as he carries
on the course of the classes he has
left, he begins to take an interest in
competition. Let it not be imagined
that this seclusion, though severe, is
allowed to affect the health of the recluse.
This would be entirely to misunderstand
the parental foresight of
the founder. The boys take long
walks in the country, each in turn, as
we have said, accompanied by a professor.
They visit the neighboring
farms, and sometimes enter a cottage
on a visit of charity; practise gymnastics,
or take lessons in fencing
and when their conduct is unexceptionable,
they are invited to dine with
M. Demetz. If, after returning home,
they are tempted to relapse into bad
habits, they are sent back again, but
to a more austere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rÃ©gime</i>. Such is
the effect produced by this system, at
once tender and severe, that very
often his former pupils request of M.
Demetz the privilege of again passing
a few days of calmness in peaceful retreat,
or to finish some task that demands
seclusion, at the Paternal Home.
To them, the retreat where they were
restored to a sense of duty is really
a home of the heart, and the hand
that raised them up is blessed as that
of the father, who spared neither severity
nor tenderness for their complete
restoration. What wonder that
he is the object of their devoted affection?
Is there no American capable
of imitating such a model?</p>

<h2>THE FIRST &OElig;CUMENICAL COUNCIL OF THE VATICAN.<br />

<small>NUMBER SEVEN.</small></h2>


<p>The preamble and first four chapters
of the dogmatic constitution <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de
Fide Catholica</i> having been irrevocably
disposed of in the public session held
on Low-Sunday, are now before your
readers and the world.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the veil of secrecy
from this portion of the <i>schema</i>
has removed from the eyes of many,
the scales of doubt and misgiving,
blinded as they were by the repeated
statements of certain newspaper correspondents;
and as future decrees
come to light, they will equally confound
the pretensions of the false prophets,
and amply reward the patient
hope of the faithful.</p>

<p>The Vatican Council took a fresh
start on the following Friday, April
29th. In the general congregation
of that day, the fathers passed from
faith to discipline, and began to discuss
the reformed <i>schema</i> on the <cite>Little
Catechism</cite>.</p>

<p>After the mass, which was said by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span>the Archbishop of Corfu, the council
was addressed by Mgr. Wierzchleyski,
Archbishop of Leopoli, in Galician
Poland, who spoke in the name of
the deputation on discipline, of which
he is a distinguished member.</p>

<p>Speeches were afterward made by
the Cardinal Archbishop of Bordeaux,
Cardinal Rauscher of Vienna, and by
the Bishops of Guastalla, Saluzzo, and
St. Augustine, Florida.</p>

<p>The next morning, Saturday, the
30th, the discussion was resumed. The
Archbishop of Avignon, and the Bishops
of LuÃ§on and Parma made some
remarks on the general features of the
<i>schema</i>. These prelates were followed
by the distinguished Bishop Von
Ketteler of Mayence, the Bishops of
Plymouth and of Clifton in England,
and the Bishop of TrÃ¨ves in Germany;
all of whom confined themselves to
some particular points of the document.
Bishop Von Ketteler, who belongs
to a baronial family in Germany,
before becoming a chief in the church
militant, served his country with distinction
as colonel in the German
army. He must be at least six feet
high, has quite a soldierly bearing, and
is concise and to the point in his remarks.
The last speaker was the
Bishop of Seckau in Germany, a
member of the deputation.</p>

<p>As the rules of the council authorize
the members of the deputation to reply
to the observations of the fathers
at any stage of the discussion, the
committee avail themselves of that
privilege by making the final speech,
which in ecclesiastical convocations,
as well as in civil meetings, is generally
the most telling one.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the remarks
by the Bishop of Seckau, the president
declared that the debate on the
<cite>Little Catechism</cite> was closed, and that
the vote would be taken on the following
Wednesday, on all the amendments
proposed.</p>

<p>In the congregation of Wednesday,
May 4th, the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon
celebrated mass in the peculiar
and impressive form of the Maronite
rite. The president asked the prayers
of the fathers for the venerable Bishop
of Evreux in France, who died in his
seventieth year, and survived only
two days after returning home from
the council.</p>

<p>Permission was granted to nine
foreign bishops to return to their
sees. Among them were the Bishops
of Arichat and Charlottetown, in
British America. The regular business
commenced with a second speech
by the Bishop of Seckau, who reviewed
all the amendments proposed in the
preceding congregation. The final
vote was then taken on the <cite>Little Catechism</cite>
as a whole. Each bishop voted
<i>viva voce</i>. The term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placet</i> was used
by the prelates who gave unqualified
approbation to it; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placet juxta modum</i>
by those who had some modification
to propose, while assenting to its
general features; and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non placet</i> by
those who dissented from the measure.
The total number of votes given was
591.</p>

<p>The <cite>Little Catechism</cite>, which has received
no small share of public attention,
now "lies over" till the final
seal of approbation is stamped upon
it at the next public session.</p>

<p>The general congregations were resumed
on the 13th. After the usual
religious exercises, leave of absence
without the obligation of returning
was granted to the following prelates:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Bishop of Gezira, Mesopotamia, Syriac
rite; the Bishop of Merida, Venezuela,
South America; the Bishop of Ferns, Ireland;
the Bishop of Goulbourne, Australia;
the Bishop of Puno, Peru; the Bishop of
Santiago, Chili; the Archbishop of Marasce,
Cilicia, Armenian rite; and the Bishop of
Mardin, Chaldea, Armenian rite.</p></blockquote>

<p>The oral discussion then commenced
on the great and fundamental question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[703]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Romani Pontificis Primatu et
Infallibilitate</i>, which is comprised in a
preamble and four chapters, and which
forms the first part of the dogmatic
constitution <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Ecclesia Christi</i>.</p>

<p>These four chapters had already
passed through several manipulations
before being submitted to oral discussion.
First, the text had been distributed
to the fathers, who in due course
of time transmitted their observations
upon it to the deputation <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de fide</i>.
These observations were then maturely
examined by the members of the
deputation, and a printed report of
their views on them was sent to the
residence of each bishop.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Poitiers, in the name
of the deputation, opened the discussion
with a lucid exposition and vindication
of the substance and form
of the text. With this lengthy and
learned speech closed the congregation
of the 13th.</p>

<p>Next day, the debate was resumed.
The Venerable Constantine Patrizzi,
Cardinal Vicar of Rome, and, with the
exception of Cardinal Mattei, the oldest
member of the Sacred College, commenced
the discussion. He was followed
by the Archbishop of San
Francisco, United States; the Archbishop
of Messina, Sicily; the Archbishop
of Catania, Italy; the Bishop of Dijon,
France; the Bishop of Vesprim, Hungary;
the Bishop of Zamora, Spain,
and the Bishop of Patti, kingdom of
Naples.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 17th, Archbishop
Dechamps, Primate of Belgium, addressed
the fathers in the name of the
deputation. Speeches were also delivered
by the Bishops of St. Brieux,
France; Santo Gallo, Switzerland, and
of Rottenburg, WÃ¼rtemberg. The
president announced the death of the
Bishop of Olinda, in Brazil, and recommended
him to the prayers of the
council.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the 18th. The Archbishop
of Saragossa opened the discussion,
representing the deputation.
The other speakers in the congregation
were all cardinals, namely, Cardinal
Schwarzenberg, Archbishop of
Prague, Bohemia; Cardinal Donnet,
of Bordeaux, and Cardinal Rauscher,
of Vienna.</p>

<p>Thursday, the 19th. Cardinal Cullen
of Dublin was the first speaker, and was
succeeded by the Cardinal Archbishop
of Valladolid, Spain, and by the Greek-Melchite
Patriarch of Antioch.</p>

<p>Friday, the 20th. The Primate of
Hungary had the advantage of the
opening speech. The venerable Dr.
McHale came next. "The Lion of
the fold of Juda," as he is called, looks
as <i>hale</i> as a man of forty-five, though
he is a bishop since 1825. The Archbishops
of Corfu and Paris occupied
the pulpit during the remainder of the
session.</p>

<p>Saturday, the 21st. Bishop Leahy,
of Cashel, reviewed some of the preceding
speeches as a delegate of the
deputation, and was followed by the
Bishops of Strasburg, Forli, and Castellamare,
Italy.</p>

<p>Intense and unwavering interest
was manifested in each of the foregoing
congregations, both on account
of the grave character of the subjects
under deliberation, and the eminent
prelates that took part in the discussion.
I wish that, together with the
names, I were permitted to give also
the living words which fell from the
lips of these learned and eloquent
prelates. They would prove to you
that the Christian oratory of the fourth
and fifth centuries is reÃ«choed in the
nineteenth, and that it is confined to
no nation, but extends over the length
and breadth of the Catholic world.</p>

<p>The longest speech yet pronounced
in the council was delivered by the
Cardinal Archbishop of Dublin, who
spoke for an hour and forty-two minutes.
Its length was the more remarkable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span>
as Cardinal Cullen trusted
to his memory, and illustrated his discourse
by an abundance of facts and
figures.</p>

<p>It is well known that all the bishops
not only have the same faith,
but speak the same language in council;
and, with the exception of the orientals,
and members of religious orders,
they wear the same episcopal
garb. Yet it is worthy of remark that,
in spite of this uniformity in dress and
language and outward mien, scarcely
has a prelate opened his mouth from
the pulpit when his nationality is at
once discovered. He utters his <i>shibboleth</i>,
which reveals him to his brethren
as soon as Ephraim was betrayed
to Galaad.</p>

<p>You will hear a bishop whisper to
his neighbor, That speaker belongs to
the Spanish family of nations. He
hails either from the mother country or
from one of her ancient colonies of
South America, or Mexico, or Cuba.
How does he know? He forms his
judgment not merely from the little
green tuft you see on the crown of
the speaker's <i>birettum</i> or cap, but
chiefly from his pronunciation. He
will detect the Spaniard at once by
his guttural sound of <i>qui</i>, and his lisping
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placet</i>, besides many other peculiarities
of utterance.</p>

<p>The Spaniards and their South American
and Mexican cousins, though
models of episcopal gravity, have
not acquired the reputation in the
council of being generally the best
models of elocution. Their delivery
is said to be sometimes indistinct, and
their pronunciation so peculiar that,
like the rose in the wilderness, they
waste the odor of their wisdom on the
desert air. Gems of thought fall,
indeed, in profusion from their lips,
but they escape occasionally in the
too rapid current of words.</p>

<p>There are several bishops of Spanish
origin, however, who have distinguished
themselves alike by distinctness
of utterance and by a remarkable
fluency. Among others, I might mention
the Bishop of Guamango, in
Peru, and the Bishops of Havana,
and S. Concezione, in Chili.</p>

<p>The next speaker is evidently an
Italian. You know it from the musical
sentences, which flow from his
lips in such a smooth and measured
strain that he almost appears to be reciting
a select piece of Virgilian poetry.
He might seem, were not his classical
style so natural to him, to be aiming
at making a good impression not
only on your mind and heart, but also
on your ear. Whenever the letter <i>c</i>
is followed by <i>e</i> or <i>i</i>, he gives it the
soft sound of <i>ch</i>, as in our English
word <i>cheerful</i>; and he is careful to
soften down every word which would
sound harsh or grating. Sometimes,
indeed, a prelate of another country
will adopt for the nonce the Roman
style of pronunciation; but nobody
is deceived. Jacob's voice is recognized,
though he tries to clothe his
words in the form of his brother's.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible for an Italian
bishop to make a speech without
a formal introduction and peroration,
either because of his respect for
his hearers or for the great classical
masters. He may protest he will be
brief, but that word has a relative
meaning. But it must be admitted
that, for delicacy and refinement of
thought, for fecundity of ideas, and
clearness of exposition, some of the
Italians have seldom been surpassed.</p>

<p>The prelate now before you, as you
can tell at once, belongs to the Teutonic
family. He is an Austrian, or
Prussian, or Bavarian, or perhaps a
Hungarian. The German pronounces
<i>g</i> hard before <i>e</i> or <i>i</i>, contrary to the
usual practice of Latin speakers. He
makes <i>sch</i> soft before the same vowels,
pronouncing, for instance, the
word <i>schema</i> as if it were spelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span>
without a <i>c</i>. Hence the gravity of
the English-speaking bishops is occasionally
relaxed, on hearing <i>schematis</i>
sound as if it were written <i>shame it is</i>.</p>

<p>The German is more tame in delivery
than either the Italian or the
Spaniard. His colder climate tends to
subdue his gestures, as well as to moderate
his sensibility. He is not so
fond of dealing in compliments as
the Italian speakers, but goes at once
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in medias res</i>. He is generally short
and precise, and more inclined to appeal
to your head than to your heart.
At the same time, religious and logical,
the sublime superstructure of his
faith is built upon the solid foundation
of common sense.</p>

<p>If a French prelate were not known
by his <i>rabat</i>, he would be easily
distinguished by his utterance of Latin.
He has a strong tendency to
shorten the infinitive in the second
conjugation, and to lay a particular
stress on the last syllable. There is
indeed no bishop in the council who
is so readily recognized by his voice
as the Frenchman. Every one can
say to him what the Jews said to St.
Peter: "Surely thou art one of them,
for thy speech doth discover thee."
But, like Peter, he has no reason to
be ashamed of the discovery; for his
speech is not less pleasant than peculiar.
He is no exception to the cultivated
taste of his countrymen. He
is generally well understood, because
he speaks distinctly, and listened to
with pleasure, because to solid learning
he unites an animated and a nervous
style.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, a continental
writer would be the fittest person
to pronounce a correct judgment on
the style and Latinity of the English-speaking
prelates of the council.</p>

<p>I will venture, however, an observation.
Though the style of the
American, English, and Irish prelates
may have less claim to merit for
polish and studied classical Latinity,
their discourses will certainly compare
favorably with those of their
episcopal brethren from other parts
in strength of argument, in clearness
of expression, as well as in their telling
effect upon their discriminating
audience.</p>

<p>The bishops of these countries
adopt what is called the parliamentary
style. They are usually concise,
and always practical. They are in
earnest. They look and talk like
men fresh from the battle-field of the
world, who have formidable enemies
to contend with, and come before
the council well stocked with experimental
knowledge. They content
themselves with a brief statement of
the measure they propose, and a
summary of the reasons best calculated
to support it, without occupying
the council with elaborate disquisitions.</p>

<p>The number of English, Irish, and
American bishops up to the present,
who have delivered oral discourses
before the Vatican Council is comparatively
small. It must not, however,
be inferred from this that the
other prelates of these nations have
all remained inactive spectators, for
many of them have handed in written
observations on the subjects under
deliberation.</p>

<p>The following are the English-speaking
fathers who, up to the present
date, (June 2d,) have addressed
the council:</p>

<p>Archbishops Spalding, Kenrick,
and Purcell, and Bishops Whelan and
Verot, United States; Archbishop
Connolly, Nova Scotia; Archbishop
Manning, and Bishops Ullathorne,
Vaughan, Clifford, and Errington,
England; Cardinal Cullen, and Bishops
Leahy, McEvilly, and Keane,
Ireland.</p>

<p>None of the Scotch or Australian
bishops have as yet spoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[706]</a></span></p>

<p>Three hundred years have elapsed
since the close of the Council of Trent.
Of the two hundred and seventy bishops
who assisted at that council,
only four were from the British Isles,
of whom three were Irish and one
English; and we think it doubtful if
these three Irish bishops spoke the
English language.</p>

<p>The Council of the Vatican has
upward of one hundred and twenty
English-speaking prelates, representing
not only Great Britain and Ireland,
but also the United States,
British America, Oceanica, and the
East Indies; and should the twentieth
&oelig;cumenical council be called
within the course of another century,
judging from the past, it is not unlikely
that the English tongue will
then be what the Italian is to-day&mdash;the
language of the majority.</p>

<p>Comparisons have been drawn between
the Council of the Vatican and
the United States Congress. Perhaps
it would be easier to point out
the lines of divergence than those of
resemblance between these two deliberative
bodies.</p>

<p>As to the relative ages of the members
of the Council and the members
of Congress, the former are decidedly
in advance of the latter. I have
taken the pains to refer to the <cite>Annuario
Pontificio</cite> for 1870, which gives the
age of nearly all the bishops of the
Catholic world. From this book I
learn that the oldest bishop in the
council is in his eighty-fifth year,
while the youngest bishop, the Vicar
Apostolic of North Carolina, is thirty-five.
The Archbishop of Lima, who
was prevented by infirmities from
coming to Rome, is the dean of the
entire episcopacy, being now in his
ninety-sixth year. Thus we see that
both extremes of age meet on the
American continent; North America
having the youngest, and South America
the oldest representative of the
episcopal hierarchy.</p>

<p>Of the thousand bishops now in the
church, fully three fourths are between
the ages of fifty-five and ninety-six.
The ages of the other fourth range
between thirty-five and fifty-five.
Scarcely half a dozen of these prelates
are more advanced in years than the
Holy Father, who yet exhibits more
physical endurance and mental activity
than any bishop ten years his
junior.</p>

<p>So much for a comparison as to
age. Next as to the speeches in both
assemblies. The bishops embrace a
wider field in their discourses than
our senators. They are circumscribed
by no limits of country. They
make laws which bind the consciences
of two hundred millions of souls&mdash;Europeans,
Americans, Australians,
Asiatics, and Africans; while Congress
legislates for scarcely one fifth
that number, and these confined within
a portion of a single continent.
Hence, in this single aspect of the
case, the great ecclesiastical synod as
far excels the Federal Congress of the
United States as Congress itself surpasses
the New York Legislature, or
this latter the city council.</p>

<p>The speeches of the Vatican Council
are usually much shorter than
those delivered in Congress. The
addresses of the fathers seldom exceed
half an hour,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> except those of
the members of the deputations,
whose remarks generally embrace
a critical analysis of the questions
before the council and a review of
the amendments proposed by the
bishops, usually occupying about the
space of an hour. The reason for
this brevity is obvious. No prelate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[707]</a></span>would wish to be guilty of the bad
taste of occupying unnecessarily the
precious time of his brother bishops.
He is fully convinced, on ascending
the pulpit, that every word he says
will be carefully weighed in the balance
by a discriminating body of
judges, who are influenced only by
sound logic, and not by plausible
rhetoric.</p>

<p>Besides their brevity, perhaps I
might also add that the speeches of
the fathers are characterized by more
personal independence, sincerity, and
earnestness of tone, than those of
our legislators in Washington, while
it must be admitted that public opinion
commonly attributes to the episcopal
character a higher order of virtue.
Yet, apart from this consideration,
we may find a reason for this difference
in the fact that our national
representatives have more temptations
to sin against singleness of purpose
than the prelates of the council.
Besides the members on the floor of
the House and Senate, there are often
well-filled galleries ready to hiss or to
applaud, according to the prejudices
of the day, and we know how human
nature dreads the finger of scorn and
loves the popular plaudits. There is
a political party which must be sustained
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per fas et nefas</i>, and though
last, not least, there are dear constituents
to be pleased.</p>

<p>The fathers of the council have no
such temptations to withdraw them
from the strict line of duty which
conscience dictates. All their general
congregations are so many secret
sessions. There are no frowning or
fawning galleries to allure or to intimidate.
There is no party lash
hanging over the bishops' heads; for
they have no private measures to propose
in behalf of their "constituents."
Indeed, one of the rules of the council
requires that every bill brought
before it must necessarily affect the
general interests of the church, and
not the special wants of any particular
diocese or country.</p>

<p>The consoling unanimity which
marked the public session held on
Low-Sunday, seems to have put an
effectual quietus on the erratic correspondent
of the London <cite>Times</cite>; for he
no longer, like another Cassandra,
utters his prophetic warnings to the
council, since the fathers, on the occasion
alluded to, by a single breath
demolished all his previous predictions
about the threatened rupture of
the assemblage.</p>

<p>Directed, no doubt, to view every
thing in Rome with distorted vision,
this writer literally fulfilled his instructions.
If he met bishops walking to
St. Peter's, he would despise them as
a contemptible set. Should they prefer
to ride, they were, in his estimation,
pampered prelates crushing poor
pedestrians under their Juggernaut.
Should a <i>schema</i> be approved by the
bishops after a brief discussion, they
were pronounced by our seer a packed
jury, the obsequious slaves of the
pope. If the discussion happened to
be prolonged, he would solemnly announce
to his readers the existence
of an incipient schism among the fathers.
The truth is, the gentleman
could never ascend high enough to
comprehend the true character of the
bishops. He could not associate in his
mind independence of thought and the
fullest freedom of debate with a profound
reverence for the Holy Father.</p>

<p>Upon every question, from the beginning
of the council, there has been
prolonged and animated discussion.
A council necessarily supposes discussion
ever since that of Jerusalem.
Deprive an &oelig;cumenical synod of the
privilege of debate, and you strip it
at once of its true character and the
bishops of their manhood. No stone
was left unturned that the whole truth
might be brought to light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[708]</a></span></p>

<p>But if there has been "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in dubiis libertas</i>,"
there has been also "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in necessariis
unitas</i>." There is no Colenso
in the Council of the Vatican. With
regard to doctrines of the Catholic
faith already promulgated, there has
not been a whisper of dissent. A
bishop might as well attempt to pull
down the immortal dome of Michael
Angelo suspended over his head, as
touch with profane hands a single
stone of the glorious edifice of Catholic
faith.</p>

<p>There has been also "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in omnibus caritas</i>."
Never was more dignity manifest
in any deliberative assembly. A single
glance at the council in session, from
one of the side galleries, would at
once impress the beholder not only
with the majesty of the spectacle, but
also with the mutual respect which
the members exhibit toward each other,
and the patient attention with
which the speakers are listened to,
often under a trying ordeal of several
hours' continuous session. As for
violent scenes, there have been none,
except in the imagination of some
correspondents; nor bantering, nor
personalities; nor collisions between
the presidents and speakers. Since
the commencement of the discussion
on the present <i>schema</i>, upward of
sixty fathers have already spoken,
only one of whom was called to order&mdash;and
he at the end of his discourse,
because, in the judgment of
the president, he had broached a subject
foreign to the debate. In a word,
there is learning without ostentation;
difference of sentiment without animosity;
respect without severity; liberty
of discussion without the license
of vituperation.</p>

<p>May 23d, the congregations were
resumed. The opening speech was
delivered by the Armenian Patriarch.
The Bishops of Mayence, AngoulÃªme,
and Grenoble occupied the attention
of the fathers during the remainder
of the session.</p>

<p>On the following day, permanent
leave of absence was granted to eight
prelates, among whom were two Canadians,
namely, the Bishop of St.
Hyacinthe, and the coadjutor of
Dr. Cooke, Bishop of Three Rivers,
lately deceased. The council was
then addressed by the Bishop of Sion,
Switzerland, one of the deputation,
and by the Bishops of Urgel, Spain,
S. Concezione, Chili, and Guastalla,
Italy.</p>

<p>In the congregation of the 25th,
England and Ireland had the whole
field to themselves, the only speakers
being Archbishop Manning, and Bishops
Clifford and McEvilly. Dr.
Manning's reputation as an English
speaker is established wherever the
English language prevails. His Latin
oration in the council, which was but
three minutes shorter than that of
his eminence of Dublin, exhibited the
same energy of thought and the same
discriminating choice of words which
are so striking a feature of his public
discourses. Dr. Manning has a commanding
figure. His fleshless face is
the personification of asceticism. His
sunken eyes pierce you as well as his
words. He has a high, well-developed
forehead, which appears still more
prominent on account of partial baldness.
His favorite, almost his only
gesture, is the darting of his forefinger
in a sloping direction from his
body, and which might seem awkward
in others, but in him is quite
natural, and gives a peculiar force to
his expressions. His countenance,
even in the heat of an argument, remains
almost as unimpassioned as a
statue. He knows admirably well
how to employ to the best advantage
his voice, as well as his words. When
he wishes to gain a strong point, he
rallies his choicest battalion of words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
to each of which he assigns the most
effective position; then his voice,
swelling with the occasion, imparts
to them an energy and a power difficult
to resist.</p>

<p>The next congregation, the sixtieth
from the opening of the council, was
held on the 28th, the speakers being
the Bishops of Ratisbonne, St. Augustine,
Csanad and Gran Varadin in
Hungary, and Coutance in France.
At the close, the president announced
that the fathers henceforth would meet
at half-past eight <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> instead of nine.</p>

<p>The fathers assembled again on the
30th. The Archbishop of Baltimore
delivered the opening speech, which
lasted about fifty minutes. He spoke
without the aid of manuscript, confiding
in his faithful and tenacious memory.
He was succeeded by the Bishops
of Le Puy in France, BÃ¢le in
Switzerland, Sutri and Saluzzo, Italy,
Constantina, Algiers, and the Vicar
Apostolic of Quilon, on the coast of
Malabar.</p>

<p>The following day, indefinite leave
of absence was granted to Bishops
Demers of Vancouver, and Hennessy
of Dubuque, and the newly consecrated
Bishop of Alton was permitted
to remain at home. The Archbishop
of Utrecht commenced the debate,
being the first of the bishops of Holland
that has addressed the council;
the other speakers were the Latin Patriarch
of Jerusalem, the Bishop of
Trajanopolis, the Archbishop of Cincinnati,
who spoke without notes, and
the Archbishop of Halifax. The death
of the saintly and apostolic Archbishop
Odin, of New Orleans, was announced.
The venerable prelate finished
his course among his kindred near
Lyons, on the auspicious festival of
the Ascension.</p>

<p>The sixty-third general congregation
was held on the 2d of June.
The speakers were the Archbishop of
Fogaras, Transylvania, Roumenian
rite, and the Bishops of Moulins, Bosnia,
Chartres and Tanes.</p>

<p>At the close of the session, the
death of the Rt. Rev. Thomas Grant,
Bishop of Southwark, England, was
announced. Dr. Grant was born of
English parents in Ligny, in the diocese
of Arras, France, November 25th,
1816, and was promoted to the episcopal
dignity June 22d, 1851. He
was much esteemed by his English
brethren in the episcopacy for his
profound learning and solid judgment,
as well as for his amiable disposition.
He was one of the deputation on oriental
rites.</p>

<p>Thus far, fourteen general congregations
have been held on the four
first chapters of the <cite>Dogmatic Constitution
of the Church of Christ</cite>. Sixty-one
fathers have already spoken on
the general aspects of the question,
leaving forty-nine prelates who have
declared their intention to speak on
the same subject. As soon as the
draught of the <i>schema in general</i> has
been sufficiently discussed, the debate
will commence on each particular chapter.</p>

<p>As our readers would like, no
doubt, to form a more intimate acquaintance
with the venerable bishops
now assembled in council, especially
with those who play a more conspicuous
part in its deliberations, we propose
in the present number to give a
brief sketch of a few of the twenty-four
fathers who constitute the committee
on faith.</p>

<p>It is quite unnecessary to our present
purpose to speak of the two American
prelates belonging to this deputation,
namely, the Archbishops of Baltimore
and San Francisco, who are well
known in the United States, and
whose learning, zeal, and piety are not
only gratefully acknowledged at home,
but fully appreciated here, as the merited
honors conferred upon them testify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span></p>

<p>We will commence with Aloysius,
Cardinal Bilio, president of the deputation
on faith, and one of the five
presiding officers of the council. He
was born May 25th, 1826, at Alexandria,
the celebrated fortified town of
Piedmont, which of late years has
played so important a part in the history
of northern Italy. His father
was of a noble family. At the early
age of fourteen the youth, already remarkable
for great piety and a maturity
of character beyond his years,
asked to be admitted into the congregation
of St. Paul, founded by the venerable
Antonio Zaccaria. He was
received as a student and postulant,
and devoted himself to study with an
earnestness which soon broke down
his health, apparently never very
strong. He was obliged to suspend
his studies for several years. In fact,
for a time it was thought his health
never would rally. At last, however,
he did recover, and at once returned
to the purpose from which his mind
and heart had never wandered. Having
finished his course and received
ordination, he was made in turn professor
of Greek, of rhetoric, and of
mental philosophy in the college of
Parma, and afterward in the university
of the same city.</p>

<p>It is the custom of the religious orders
and congregations which devote
themselves either entirely or in great
part to teaching, first by a long and
thorough course of study to prepare
carefully their younger members for
future labors in the professorial chair,
and then in their early years of teaching
to appoint them from one chair to
another, through the whole cycle, perhaps.
So Father Bilio was sent from
Parma to Caravaggio, and then to
Naples, occupying various chairs, and
finally was made professor of theology
and canon law in the Barnabite
College at Rome. His professorships
were for the world outside his congregation.
Within it, his brethren recognized
his high personal qualifications,
and elected him to various offices in
their congregation, until at length he
was made assistant-general.</p>

<p>Rome could not fail to appreciate
qualities and talents like those of this
learned and exemplary, religious and
able man. He was pressed into service
in many of the departments for
transacting religious affairs, and finally,
June 23d, 1866, he was named
cardinal. He presided over one of
the sub-commissions of theologians,
who studied out and prepared the
draughts for the council, and he is, as
was said in a former number, chairman
of the special committee or deputation
of twenty-four prelates to
treat of all matters relating to faith.</p>

<p>With the single exception of Cardinal
Bonaparte, Cardinal Bilio is the
youngest member of the Sacred College.</p>

<p>France, the eldest daughter of the
church, is represented in the deputation
by Bishop Pie of Poitiers, and
Archbishop Regnier of Cambrai.</p>

<p>Louis Francis DesirÃ© Edward Pie
was born at Pontgouin, in the diocese
of Chartres, the 26th of September,
1815. Ordained priest in 1839, he
exercised at first the functions of curate
of the cathedral church of Chartres;
and in 1845, the bishop of that diocese
appointed him vicar-general, notwithstanding
his comparative youth.</p>

<p>From that period, the young priest
was ranked among the most distinguished
preachers of France, and was
heard with great success in different
cities of that country. His panegyric
of Joan of Arc, which he preached at
Orleans, is one of his best discourses.</p>

<p>Named Bishop of Poitiers under the
presidency, he took possession of his
see in December, 1849. He was
then only in his thirty-fourth year, an
unusually early age for conferring the
mitre in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span></p>

<p>Bishop Pie directed his eloquence
and zeal on various occasions against
two sorts of adversaries: those who
sap the foundations of faith itself by
reducing every thing to naturalism,
both in religion and society; and those
who attempt to weaken Catholicity
by the ruin of the temporal power.
Against the former the bishop issued
three <cite>Synodal Instructions on the Principal
Errors of the Present Time</cite>. Against
the latter he wrote, three years before
the last Italian revolution, his <cite>Synodal
Instruction on Rome considered as the
See of the Papacy</cite>, in which he ably
refuted the sophistries of those who
sought the demolition of the temporal
power.</p>

<p>Those best acquainted with the Bishop
of Poitiers say that his pulpit
oratory is characterized by an authority,
brilliancy, and force of argument
worthy of St. Hilary, whose successor
he is.</p>

<p>In personal appearance Bishop Pie
is prepossessing. His round, full
face without a wrinkle, and his auburn
hair, make him seem much younger
than he really is. Though stout, and
even inclined to corpulency, he is
quick and active in his movements.</p>

<p>He speaks with admiration of the
late Bishop of Boston, with whom he
studied at St. Sulpice, Paris. The Sulpician
fathers have been accustomed
to select as catechists in the parochial
church some of their ablest and most
promising students. To both seminarians
a class was assigned, and the
Bishop of Poitiers says that his American
friend, afterward Bishop Fitzpatrick,
always excelled in his position.</p>

<p>Emmanuel Garcia Gil, Archbishop
of Saragossa, in Spain, was born in St.
Salvador, March 14th, 1802.</p>

<p>Having completed his literary studies
in his native city, he passed
through his philosophical and theological
course in the diocesan seminary
of De Lugo. In 1825, he entered the
order of St. Dominic, in which he
made his religious profession November
1st, 1826.</p>

<p>He was ordained the following year,
and immediately after the responsible
position of professor of philosophy and
theology in the convents of the order
at De Lugo and Compostello was assigned
to him.</p>

<p>Expelled in 1835 from Spain, with
all the members of his order, he soon
returned to his post at De Lugo, where
for thirteen years he filled the chair
of philosophy and divinity in the seminary
of which he was successively
director and vice-rector.</p>

<p>Having subsequently devoted himself
to the more active pursuits of the
ministry, he labored with great success
in preaching the word of God,
and in the administration of the sacraments.</p>

<p>Appointed to the see of Badajoz in
December, 1853, he was consecrated
in the city of De Lugo by the Archbishop
of Compostello; and five years
later, at the request of the Spanish
government, he was transferred to the
archiepiscopal see of Saragossa.</p>

<p>Among his fellow-members of the
Committee on Faith, Mgr. Garcia Gil
has the merited reputation of being
profoundly conversant with the writings
of his great master, the "Angel
of the Schools," and hence is called
among them the St. Thomas of the
deputation.</p>

<p>Another prominent member of the
committee is Mgr. Hassoun, Patriarch
of Cilicia for the Armenians. He
was born in Constantinople, June 13th,
1809, of Armenian parents. He passed
through his elementary course in
his native city, and completed his studies
in Rome, where, in 1832, he obtained
the degree of doctor of divinity.
A few months later, having
been ordained priest, and named
apostolic missionary, he was sent to
Smyrna, where he devoted himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[712]</a></span>
the Armenian Christians of that city.
Removed thence to Constantinople,
Father Hassoun exercised the ministry
in several churches, and filled the
office of chancellor in the archiepiscopal
palace. Chosen by the primate
as vicar-general and visitor of the diocese
and province, the young Armenian
priest was unanimously elected
by the assembly of his nation civil
prefect of the Armenian church, in
which office he was confirmed by the
Ottoman Porte.</p>

<p>In 1842, he was appointed coadjutor
to the Primate of Constantinople, with
the right of succession; and on the
death of the latter, in 1846, he was
chosen to fill the vacant see.</p>

<p>On the 16th of September, 1866,
the Armenian archbishops and bishops
assembled in council proclaimed Mgr.
Hassoun Patriarch of Cilicia, with the
title of Anthony Peter IX. The holy
see confirmed the nomination, and
decided that in future the patriarchal
see of Cilicia and the archi-primatial
see of Constantinople, which hitherto
were separate and independent, should
form one patriarchate, under the title
of Patriarchate of Cilicia, with residence
at Constantinople.</p>

<p>By his exertions the episcopal hierarchy
was reÃ«stablished in 1850 in
the ecclesiastical province of Constantinople,
and a special see for the Armenians
erected in Persia. He has
succeeded in building in the Turkish
capital, and endowing a seminary to
serve for the whole ecclesiastical province.
In 1843, Mgr. Hassoun founded
the first female convent in the
same capital; and we may well imagine
the degree of pious audacity that
was required to plant this colony of
virgins in the midst of the sultan's
seraglios. This institution is devoted
to the education of young girls, and
to the instruction of women abandoning
schism. The convent has sixty
nuns, who educate three hundred
poor girls, besides some resident scholars.</p>

<p>The patriarch, by an imperial firman,
is charged with all the civil and
ecclesiastical affairs of the Armenians
who are subjects of the Ottoman empire.
He gratefully acknowledges
the kind disposition always manifested
toward him by the government of
the Sublime Porte, which has extended
to him every facility for carrying
out the works of his ministry.</p>

<p>Victor Augustus Isidore Dechamps,
one of the most prominent members
of the deputation <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de fide</i>, was born at
Melle, Eastern Flanders, in the chÃ¢teau
of Scailmont, December 16th, 1810.
His early education was intrusted to
private tutors, under the eyes of his
father, who was a laureate of the ancient
University of Louvain. He
afterward completed his studies of
humanity and philosophy with his
brother Adolph, who was successively
Belgian minister of foreign affairs
and minister of state.</p>

<p>In the national movement, from
which sprung the independence of
Belgium, the two brothers, though yet
young, distinguished themselves as
publicists during this glorious epoch
of patriotism.</p>

<p>In 1832, M. Dechamps entered the
seminary of Tournai, studied afterward
in the Catholic university of Mechlin,
and concluded his theological course
at Louvain, where he was ordained
priest, December, 1834, by Cardinal
Sterckx.</p>

<p>Having soon after joined the Redemptorist
congregation, Father Dechamps
made his novitiate in 1835.
Five years later, his career as a preacher
began, and in this capacity he
greatly distinguished himself.</p>

<p>After the death of Queen Louise of
Belgium, in obedience to the express
desire of that pious princess, he was
charged with the religious instruction
of the royal princes, and of the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span>
Charlotte. Rev. Father Dechamps
was named Bishop of Namur, September,
1865. Two years later, he
was transferred to the archdiocese of
Mechlin, in which Brussels is included;
and since the opening of the
council he has been elevated by
the holy see to the primacy of Belgium.</p>

<p>Monsgr. Dechamps has written several
valuable works, the most important
of which are: 1st. <cite>The Free Examination
of the Truth of Faith</cite>; 2d.
<cite>The Divinity of Jesus Christ</cite>; 3d.
<cite>The Religious Question resolved by
Facts; or, Certainty in Matters of Religion</cite>;
4th. <cite>Pius IX. and Contemporary
Errors</cite>; 5th. <cite>The New Eve, or,
Mother of Life</cite>, all of which have been
translated into most of the languages
of Europe.</p>

<p>The style of Archbishop Dechamps
is calm, concise, and profound, blended
with an attractive unction. His
round and pleasing countenance bears
upon it the stamp of intellect and
energy. Like so many of his gifted
countrymen, the prelate of Mechlin
unites in his person the mental activity
of the Frenchman with the solidity
of the German.</p>

<p>John Baptist Simor, Archbishop of
Strigonium and Primate of Hungary,
was born August 24th, 1813, in the
ancient Hungarian city of Fehervar,
which is memorable in history as being
the place where the kings of Hungary
were formerly crowned and buried.</p>

<p>He pursued his philosophical course
in the archiepiscopal lyceum of Magy-Szombat,
and his course of theology
in the University of Vienna, which
honored him with the title of doctor
of sacred theology. After the successful
completion of his studies, he
was ordained priest of the archdiocese
of Strigonium in 1836.</p>

<p>Appointed, first, assistant pastor
of a church in Pesth, Father Simor
soon after received a professor's chair
in the university of that city, and subsequently
filled several responsible
positions, both in the government of
souls and in instructing the more advanced
candidates for the ministry
in a higher course of theology.</p>

<p>On the 29th of June, 1857, he was
consecrated Bishop of GyÃ¶r, and ten
years later, on the demise of Cardinal
Scilovszky, Bishop Simor was chosen
to succeed that eminent prelate as
Prince-Primate of Hungary and Archbishop
of Strigonium.</p>

<p>Besides his ecclesiastical eminence,
the Primate of Hungary has had distinguished
state honors conferred on him.
He is the first member of the king's
privy council. By established law,
the ceremony of crowning the king
devolves exclusively on the primate.
Otherwise the coronation is not considered
legitimate. The Bishop of
Veszprim crowns the queen. The
present Emperor, Francis Joseph of
Austria, received the crown of the
kingdom of Hungary from the hands
of Archbishop Simor, on the vigil of
Pentecost, 1867, in the presence of an
immense assembly of people from all
parts of the kingdom. The primate
is moreover <i>ex-officio</i> chief secretary
and chancellor of the sovereign of
Hungary. He is also first magistrate
of the county or department of Strigonium.
Hungary contains fifty-two
of these departments, each presided
over by a chief magistrate.</p>

<p>He has also a seat in the general
assembly or parliament of Hungary,
a privilege which is enjoyed in common
with him by every Catholic
bishop of the kingdom. Many other
prerogatives were inherent in the
primatial dignity till they were swept
away by the revolution of 1848.</p>

<p>Monsgr. Simor informed us that
the faithful of his diocese number a
million of souls, comprising three
distinct nationalities, Hungarians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span>
Sclaves, and Germans, who speak as
many distinct languages.</p>

<p>The primate is consequently obliged,
in the visitation of his diocese, to
employ these three tongues. In corresponding
with his clergy, whether
Hungarian, Sclavonic, or German, he
invariably uses Latin, of which he is
a perfect master, and which, till a recent
date, was the common language
of the greater part of Hungary.</p>

<p>We add to the remarks of our correspondent
the following items of information
concerning the doings of
the council since the date of his letter.
Between June 2d and June 18th
ten general congregations were held.
The preface, and the first two chapters
of the <i>schema</i> on the Roman
Pontiff, were voted on and adopted;
the discussion of the third chapter,
was closed, and on the 15th of June
the discussion of the fourth chapter,
concerning the infallibility of the Roman
Pontiff, was opened. At that
date, seventy-four fathers had inscribed
their names as intending to
speak, and this number had been increased
to one hundred at the general
congregation of June 18th.</p>

<h2>FOREIGN LITERARY NOTES.</h2>


<p>Within the past six months the literary
bulletins of France, England, and
Germany are full of notices of new
works on the subject of the Apostle St.
Paul and his writings. One of the latest
in England is by Dr. Arnold, who&mdash;Anglican
as he is&mdash;takes direct issue
with an opinion of the French rationalist
Renan, which on its first appearance
gave great gratification to the
Protestant world. In his work on St.
Paul, Renan said in his flippant way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After having been for three hundred
years, thanks to Protestantism, the Christian
doctor <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, Paul is now coming
to the end of his reign."</p></blockquote>

<p>On this remarkable opinion, Dr. Arnold
thus comments:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Precisely the contrary, I venture to think,
is the judgment to which a true criticism of
men and things leads us. The Protestantism
which has so used and abused St. Paul is
coming to an end; its organizations, strong
and active as they look, are touched with
the finger of death; its fundamental ideas,
sounding forth still every week from thousands
of pulpits, have in them no significance
and no power for the progressive
thought of humanity. But the reign of the
real St. Paul is only beginning; his fundamental
ideas, disengaged from the elaborate
misconceptions with which Protestantism
has overlaid them, will have an influence in
the future greater than any which they
have yet had&mdash;an influence proportioned to
their correspondence with a number of the
deepest and most permanent facts of human
nature itself."&mdash;<i>From St. Paul and Protestantism,
by Matthew Arnold.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most important events of
the reign of Louis XIV., and, indeed,
in the entire religious history of France,
was the assembly of the clergy of France
in the year 1682. Numerous works
have been written and published concerning
it, the best and most exhaustive
of which are the two last. In 1868, M.
Charles GÃ©rin, a judge of the Civil Tribunal
of the Seine, published his <cite>Recherches
Historiques sur l'AssemblÃ©e
du ClergÃ© de France de 1682</cite>. The author
brought to his task great learning,
decided ability, and an industry that
proved itself by the number of original
documents from the public archives for
the first time presented by him. The
result of M. GÃ©rin's labors was generally
accepted in France as final. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>
this verdict, however, Monseigneur
Maret, Bishop of Sura, did not agree,
and protested against it in his work, <cite>Du
Concile et de la Paix religieuse</cite>, intimating
therein that the documents
cited in M. GÃ©rin's book needed fresh
revision and interpretation, which they
should receive. This announcement
was naturally accepted as signifying
that a new work on the assembly of
1682 might be looked for. That was
indeed its signification, and early in
1870 appeared an announcement of the
publishers, Didier &amp; Co., Paris, of a
book entitled, <cite>L'AssemblÃ©e du ClergÃ© de
France de 1682 d'aprÃ¨s des documents
dont un grand nombre inconnus jusqu'Ã 
ce jour</cite>. Par l'AbbÃ© Jules-ThÃ©odose
Loyson, Docteur et Professeur en Sorbonne.
8vo, 530 pages. To this, Judge
GÃ©rin soon replied in his <cite>Une Nouvelle
Apologie du Gallicanisme, RÃ©ponse
Ã  M. l'AbbÃ© Loyson</cite>. Outside of the
historical statements concerning the
events attending the assembly of 1682,
these works are, in fact, a rather animated
polemical discussion of the questions
of the temporal power and the
papal infallibility.</p>

<p>When St. Patrick entered upon his
great apostolic work in Ireland, he was
careful not to offend the attachment
borne by his converts to their ancient
national traditions, the songs of their
bards, and the laws by which they were
governed. On the contrary, he advised
Lacighaise, king of the country, to have
reduced to writing all the ancient judicial
decisions, and, with the aid of two
other bishops, commenced the work
himself. To the body of laws thus collected
was given the title of <cite>Senchus
Mor</cite>, (collection of ancient knowledge.)
Written <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 440, this book served as
the Irish code before the departure of
the Romans, and was in legal force up
to the period of the accession of James
I., traces of its influence being to this
day plainly visible. The most authentic
manuscripts containing the <cite>Senchus
Mor</cite> formerly belonged to an English
literary amateur, and through the efforts
of Edmund Burke were acquired
by the English government. Their
publication was commenced in 1852,
and has been resumed, as we perceive
by the following announcement: <cite>Ancient
Laws of Ireland. Senchus Mor.</cite>

LL.D., and the Rev. Thaddeus
O'Mahony. Dublin: Printed for Her
Majesty's Stationery Office. 1870. 8vo.</p>

<p>Some curious information and revolting
details concerning the continuation
of the slave-trade in Africa are furnished
in a work lately published at Paris,
<cite>La Traite Orientale</cite>. The Mussulman
still needs slaves and concubines, and
three great slave marts still exist to
supply them. These are the Island of
Zanzibar, the southern portion of Egypt,
and Arabia. At Zanzibar a healthy man
sells for $42, while the women bring
$80, and more, if good-looking.</p>

<p>During the past ten years the history,
geography, and topography of the biblical
countries have been studied with
immense activity, and the best travellers
and scholars of Germany, France, Italy,
and England have contributed their
offerings to the common fund of our
knowledge concerning these most interesting
regions. Successful research on
the banks of the Euphrates and the Tigris,
the Nile and the Jordan, not to
speak of many other points, have all in
turn confirmed the perfect veracity of
the writers of the Old and of the New
Testament. And to these, the broken
walls, the palaces, the towers, and the
sculptures of Babylon, of Nineveh, of
Persepolis, of Jerusalem, and of Samaria,
rising in testimony of the truth from
the gathered ruins of ages, bear also
their testimony. A learned German ecclesiastic,
Dr. Gratz, uniting and fusing
all the information on this subject, composed
an admirable geographical history
of oriental and occidental countries,
with special reference to the biblical
period. Dr. Allioli, the celebrated scriptural
commentator, recommended the
work of Dr. Gratz as marked by so
much erudition and exactness that the
readers of his commentary are recommended
to it for information on all points
touching biblical localities. An excellent
French translation of Dr. Gratz's
work has just been published: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span>

<p>Here are two new works on the Council
of Trent: <cite>Histoire du Concile de

1 vol. 8vo. <cite>Journal du Concile de
Trente, rÃ©digÃ© par un secrÃ©taire VÃ©nitien
prÃ©sant aux sessions de 1562 Ã 
1563.</cite> This Venetian secretary was Antonio
Milledonne, attached to the embassy
sent to the Council of Trent by
the republic of Venice. To the diary
of the secretary, which forms the body
of the latter publication, are added several
original documents of the period
heretofore unpublished, among them a
summary of the dispatches of the Venetian
ambassadors to the council. M.
Baschet, the editor, suggests that the
publication of the French diplomatic
dispatches relative to the council would
be of the highest interest. These dispatches
would certainly form one of the
most curious literary monuments of the
sixteenth century, and, in point of fact,
the history of the latter period of the
council cannot well be written without
them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Baron HÃ¼bner, formerly Austrian Ambassador
at Paris and at Rome, and
well known in the diplomatic and literary
world, has just presented the fruit of
many years' labor among the state archives
of Paris, Vienna, Florence, Venice,
Simancas, and the Vatican, in the
shape of a work entitled <cite>Sixte Quint</cite>; 3
vols. 8vo. Written on an epoch already
well investigated, and upon a life
which has been the subject of many
pens, Baron HÃ¼bner's life of Pope Sixtus
V. is by far the most remarkable
and the most trustworthy we have had.
And yet it is not perhaps exact to call
his work a life of Sixtus V. The author
does not so style it, and takes up Cardinal
Montalto at the conclave where he
is elected pope. He scarcely refers retrospectively
to the early years of his
life, and pays not the slightest attention
to the semi-fabulous stories which tradition
has interwoven with the name of
the great Sixtus. If he finds documentary
evidence for any part of them, he
gives it. If not, silence falls upon
them. At the outset of his work he
merely mentions the three great names
connected with histories of Sixtus&mdash;Leti,
Tempesti, and Ranke. But he merely
mentions them, and in no case quotes
them. As to more modern historians
of Sixtus&mdash;Segretain and Dumesnil, for
instance&mdash;he does not appear to have
the slightest idea of their existence.
Baron HÃ¼bner has written his work exclusively
from original materials, and
appears to have used them conscientiously
and with excellent judgment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For nearly ten months an animated
historico-ecclesiastical discussion has
been going on in France, which, according
to the reports of literary journals,
has passed the stage of "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vive polÃ©mique</i>,"
and reached that described as
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la controverse passionÃ©e</i>." The subject
matter of the discussion is Pope
Honorius. Father Gratry (of the Oratory)
led off with a pamphlet entitled,
<cite>Mgr. l'EvÃªque d'OrlÃ©ans et Mgr. l'ArchevÃªque
de Malines</cite>, and gave the
texts of three councils which condemned
Honorius, and the confirmation of
their sentence by Pope St. Leo II. To
this came a reply by M. Chantrel, <cite>Le
Pape Honorius, PremiÃ¨re Lettre Ã  M.
l'AbbÃ© Gratry</cite>, in which he presented an
abridged text of the letters of Honorius
and testimony in his favor. Archbishop
Dechamps also answered Father Gratry
in <cite>La Question d'Honorius</cite>, citing
an interesting passage from St. Alphonse
de Liguori. Then, in its numbers
of the 10th and 25th January, and
10th February, <cite>Le Correspondant</cite> gave
an extract from the fourth volume (not
yet published) of the <cite>Histoire des Conciles</cite>,
by Bishop HÃ©felÃ©, in which the
prelate-author is severe on Honorius.
Father Colombier, on the contrary, defends
the orthodoxy of the incriminated
letters of Honorius in a series of articles
published in the <cite>Etudes Religieuses, Historiques,
et LittÃ©raires</cite>. Dom GuÃ©ranger
also treated the question in his <cite>DÃ©fense
de l'Eglise Romaine contre les Erreurs
du R. P. Gratry</cite>, published in the
<cite>Revue du Monde Catholique</cite>. Then
comes <cite>L'Univers</cite> with a letter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span>
M. AmÃ©dÃ©e de Margerie, Professor at
Nancy, in defence of Honorius. We
can merely enumerate other defenders
of Honorius who have entered the lists.
They are the AbbÃ© Constantin, (<cite>Revue
des Sciences Ecclesiastiques</cite>,) the editors
of the <cite>Civilta Cattolica</cite>, Canon Lefebre,
(<cite>Revue Catholique de Louvain</cite>,)
AbbÃ© Larroque, AbbÃ© BÃ©let, Father
Roque, and Father RamiÃ¨re. The <cite>Avenir
Catholique</cite> endeavors to demonstrate
that Honorius wrote the letters in dispute
not as pope, but as a simple doctor.
M. LÃ©on Gautier published a series
of articles on the question of infallibility,
the last of which is specially devoted
to Honorius. These articles collected
have lately been published by
PalmÃ© in a pamphlet, entitled <cite>L'InfaillibilitÃ©
devant la Raison, la Foi et
l'Histoire</cite>. Then comes a second letter
from Bishop Dechamps, and, finally, the
Bishop of Strasburg issues an energetic
condemnation of the letters of Father
Gratry.</p>

<p>The most interesting archÃ¦ological
discovery of our age, incomparable for
its antiquity and its historic and philological
interest, is unquestionably the one
lately made by M. Clermont-Ganneau,
dragoman of the consulate of France
at Jerusalem. It is that of a Hebrew
inscription of the year 896 before Christ,
cut on a monolith by order of Mescha,
King of Moab, a contemporary of the
kings Joram and Josaphat. The stone
on which the inscription is graven is in
dimension three feet four inches by
about two feet. The inscription itself
is in thirty-four lines, each line containing
from thirty-three to thirty-five letters.
It is said that there is no known
Hebrew monument comparable in antiquity
with this. M. le Comte de

it to the French Academy of Inscriptions

Charles Scribner &amp; Co. 1870. Pp.

<p>This book was probably suggested
by <cite>Gates Ajar</cite>. It is an attempt to
say something about the future state of
the human race. In some respects the
volume is more valuable than Miss
Phelps's endeavor to convey an idea of
the happiness of paradise. It is not so
materialistic. Yet both works are very
defective, because of the simple fact that
neither of the authors know any thing
of that which makes heaven to be heaven&mdash;the
beatific vision. Their highest
ideal is perfect intellectual contentment,
with unimpeded exercise of our
natural capacities and the companionship
of our friends and our blessed Saviour.
Yet it is encouraging to see that
Protestants are writing such books as
these. They are the expression of the
deepest wants of the human soul. They
prove that the Protestantism of to-day
has failed to answer these wants. If we
were not already perfectly convinced,
they would convince us, that when the
truth is adequately presented to these
souls, they will gladly accept it.</p>

<p>One great charm of these two volumes
lies in the fact that they were never
written for publication. But we regret
the omission of certain passages. The
editor of the volumes thought it wise
to withhold a portion of the notes which
were afterward absorbed into one or
another of the romances or papers in
<cite>Our Old Home</cite>. Yet surely it would have
been a pleasure to contrast the rough
sketch contained in his notes with the
elaborate and finely-finished picture
which Mr. Hawthorne afterward presented
to the public. The editor tells
us that these cartoons were carefully
finished even "at the first stroke."
However, the volumes will always be
valuable, because they give a clear insight
of their author's character. If
one writes his every-day impressions
of places, persons, and events, he gives
the world a picture of his mind. Thus
when these series of notes are completed
by the notes upon America and Italy,
we shall be enabled to form a far truer
estimate of this distinguished American
writer than we could possibly do from
those works which have given him a
name in literature, both in his own country
and in more critical and fastidious
England.</p>

<p>In many respects this is a useful contribution
to our Catholic literature. It
tells the story of a workwoman who attained
a very high degree of Christian perfection.
In its matter, the book reminds
one of <i>Marie-Eustelle Harpain</i>, but it
does not greatly resemble it in its composition.
A religious biography can do
good in two ways. It can edify the
readers with the history of remarkable
piety and virtue. And it can also elevate
and refine our minds, if it be written in
pure and correct English. Unfortunately,
this biography does not possess this
character. Its very title is an example
of a fault which is frequently seen
throughout the volume. It is the "Life
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">S&oelig;ur Marie</i>," not Sister Mary. When
this good girl addresses her director,
she does not say "Father," but it must
be "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon PÃ¨re</i>," and without the accent
to which that word is lawfully entitled.
Surely it is absurd affectation to ruin a
beautiful thought and a good English
sentence by mixing with it two or three
French words. But this is not the only
fault of the volume. It speaks of
"promises of milk and water," an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[719]</a></span>
which contains no definite idea.
It informs us that Sister Mary "went
<em>straight</em> to church." Who can tell
whether the author intends to say that
she went to church <em>immediately</em> or went
there by the most direct way? Then,
too, if this book be intended to form
one of a series of biographies of persons
who are not canonized, why call them
"Hidden <em>Saints</em>"? The holy see has
always wished us to be most careful in
the use of this word. But these faults
do not destroy the value of the book.
They are only blemishes, and in a future
edition we hope to find them completely
removed.</p>

beg leave to differ from the very
modest opinion expressed in the preface,
that the book has a character "which
stamps it as one that the young may

is a shame that such a story should be
translated and allowed to live in another

<p>This story presents a very fair picture

For all these good qualities, so rare in
modern works of fiction, the book deserves

<h2>HEREDITARY GENIUS.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></h2>


<p>Mr. Galton is what in these days
is called a <em>scientist</em>, or cultivator of
the physical sciences, whose pretension
is to confine themselves strictly
to the field of the sciences as distinguished
from science; to assert nothing
but positive facts and the laws of their
production and operation, ascertained
by careful observation and experiment,
and induction therefrom. Their aim
would seem to be to explain all the
facts or phenomena of the universe
by means of second causes, and to
prove that man is properly classed
with animals, or is only an animal developed
or completed, not an animal
transformed and specificated by a rational
soul, which is defined by the
church to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forma corporis</i>.</p>

<p>Between the scientists and philosophers,
or those who cultivate not the
special sciences, but the science of
the sciences, and determine the principles
to which the several special sciences
must be referred in order to
have any scientific character or value,
there is a long-standing quarrel,
which grows fiercer and more embittered
every day. We are far from
pretending that the positivists or Comtists
have mastered all the so-called
special sciences; but they represent
truly the aims and tendencies of the
scientists, and of what by a strange
misnomer is called philosophy; so-called,
it would seem, because philosophy
it is not. Philosophy is the science
of principles, as say the Greeks,
or of <em>first</em> principles, as say the Latins,
and after them the modern Latinized
nations. But Herbert Spencer,
Stuart Mill, and the late Sir William
Hamilton, the ablest representatives
of philosophy as generally received
by the English-speaking world,
agree with the Comtists or positivists
in rejecting first principles from the
domain of science, and in relegating
theology and metaphysics to the region
of the unknown and the unknowable.
Their labors consequently
result, as Sir William Hamilton himself
somewhere admits, in universal
nescience, or, as we say, absolute nihilism
or nullism.</p>

<p>This result is not accidental, but
follows necessarily from what is called
the Baconian method, which the
scientists follow, and which is, in scholastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span>
language, concluding the universal
from the particular. Now, in
the logic we learned as a school-boy,
and adhere to in our old age, this is
simply impossible. To every valid
argument it is necessary that one of
the premises, called the major premise,
be a universal principle. Yet the
scientists discard the universal from
their premises, and from two or more
particulars, or particular facts, profess
to draw a valid universal conclusion,
as if any conclusion broader than the
premises could be valid! The physico-theologians
are so infatuated
with the Baconian method that they
attempt, from certain facts which they
discover in the physical world, to conclude,
by way of induction, the being
and attributes of God, as if any thing
concluded from particular facts could
be any thing but a particular fact.
Hence, the aforenamed authors, with
Professor Huxley at their tail, as well
as Kant in his <cite>Kritik der Reinen Vernunft</cite>,
have proved as clearly and as
conclusively as any thing can be proved
that a causative force, or causality,
cannot be concluded by way either
of induction or of deduction from any
empirical facts, or facts of which observation
can take note. Yet the validity
of every induction rests on the
reality of the relation of cause and
effect, and the fact that the cause actually
produces the effect.</p>

<p>Yet our scientists pretend that they
can, from the observation and analysis
of facts, induce a law, and a law
that will hold good beyond the particulars
observed and analyzed. But
they do not obtain any law at all;
and the laws of nature, about which
they talk so learnedly, are not laws,
but simply facts. Bring a piece of
wax to the fire and it melts, hence it
is said to be a law that wax so brought
in proximate relation with fire will
melt; but this law is only the particular
fact observed, and the facts to which
you apply it are the identical facts
from which you have obtained it. The
investigation, in all cases where the
scientists profess to seek the law, is
simply an investigation to find out
and establish the identity of the facts,
and what they call the law is only
the assertion of that identity, and never
extends to facts not identical, or
to dissimilar facts.</p>

<p>Take mathematics; as far as the
scientist can admit mathematics, they
are simply identical propositions piled
on identical propositions, and the
only difference between Newton and
a plough-boy is, that Newton detects
identity where the plough-boy does
not. Take what is called the law of
gravitation; it is nothing but the statement
of a fact, or a class of facts observed,
and the most that it tells us is,
that if the facts are identical, they are
identical&mdash;that is, they bear such and
such relations to one another. But
let your positivist attempt to explain
transcendental mathematics, and he is
all at sea, if he does not borrow from
the ideal science or philosophy which
he professes to discard. How will
the geometrician explain his infinitely
extended lines, or lines that may be
infinitely extended? A line is made
up of a succession of points, and
therefore of parts, and nothing which
is made up of parts is infinite. The
line may be increased or diminished
by the addition or subtraction of
points, but the infinite cannot be either
increased or diminished. Whence
does the mind get this idea of infinity?
The geometrician tells us the
line may be infinitely extended&mdash;that
is, it is infinitely possible; but it cannot
be so unless there is an infinite
ground on which it can be projected.
An infinitely possible line can be asserted
only by asserting the infinitely
real, and therefore the mind, unless it
had the intuition of the infinitely real,
could not conceive of a line as capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
of infinite extension. Hence the ancients
never assert either the infinitely
possible or the infinite real. There
is in all Gentile science, or Gentile philosophy,
no conception of the infinite;
there is only the conception of
the indefinite.</p>

<p>This same reasoning disposes of
the infinite divisibility of matter still
taught in our text-books. The infinite
divisibility of matter is an infinite
absurdity; for it implies an infinity
of parts or numbers, which is
really a contradiction in terms. We
know nothing that better illustrates
the unsoundness of the method of
the scientists. Here is a piece of
matter. Can you not divide it into two
equal parts? Certainly. Can you do
the same by either of the halves?
Yes. And by the quarters. Yes. And
thus on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>? Where, then,
is the absurdity? None as long as
you deal with only finite quantities.
The absurdity is in the fact that
the infinite divisibility of matter implies
an infinity of parts; and an
infinity of parts, an infinity of numbers;
and numbers and every series
of numbers may be increased by addition,
and diminished by subtraction.
An infinite series is impossible.</p>

<p>The moment the scientists leave
the domain of particulars or positive
facts, and attempt to induce from
them a law, their induction is of no
value. Take geology. The geologist
finds in that small portion of the
globe which he has examined certain
facts, from which he concludes that
the globe is millions and millions of
ages old. Is his conclusion scientific?
Not at all. If the globe was in
the beginning in a certain state, and
if the structural and other changes
which are now going on have been
going on at the same rate from the
beginning&mdash;neither of which suppositions
is provable&mdash;then the conclusion
is valid; not otherwise. Sir Charles
Lyell, if we recollect aright, calculated
that, at the present rate, it must
have taken at least a hundred and
fifty thousand years to form the delta
of the Mississippi. Officers of the
United States army have calculated
that a little over four thousand years
would suffice.</p>

<p>So of the antiquity of man on the
globe. The scientist finds what he
takes to be human bones in a cave
along with the bones of certain long
since extinct species of animals, and
concludes that man was contemporary
with the said extinct species of animals;
therefore man existed on the
globe many, nobody can say how
many, thousand years ago. But two
things render the conclusion uncertain.
It is not certain from the fact
that their bones are found together
that man and these animals were contemporary;
and the date when these
animals became extinct, if extinct
they are, is not ascertained nor ascertainable.
They have discovered traces
in Switzerland of lacustrian habitations;
but these prove nothing, because history
itself mentions "the dwellers on
the lakes," and the oldest history accepted
by the scientists is not many
thousand years old. Sir Charles Lyell
finds, or supposes he finds, stone knives
and axes, or what he takes to be stone
knives and axes, deeply embedded in
the earth in the valley of a river, though
at some distance from its present
bed; and thence concludes the presence
of man on the earth for a period
wholly irreconcilable with the received
biblical chronology. But supposing
the facts to be as alleged, they do
not prove any thing, because we cannot
say what changes by floods or
other causes have taken place in the
soil of the locality, even during the
period of authentic history. Others
conclude from the same facts that
men were primitively savages, or ignorant
of the use of iron. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span>
most they prove is that, at some unknown
period, certain parts of Europe
were inhabited by a people who used
stone knives and axes; but whether
because ignorant of iron, or because
unable from their poverty or their distance
from places where they were
manufactured to procure similar iron
utensils, they give us no information.
Instances enough are recorded
in history of the use of stone knives
by a people who possessed knives
made of iron. Because in our day
some Indian tribes use bows and arrows,
are we to conclude that fire-arms
are unknown in our age of the
world?</p>

<p>What the scientists offer as proof
is seldom any proof at all. If an
hypothesis they invent explains the
known facts of a case, they assert it
as proved, and therefore true. What
fun would they not make of theologians
and philosophers, if they reasoned
as loosely as they do themselves?
Before we can conclude an
hypothesis is true because it explains
the known facts in the case, we must
prove, 1st, that there are and can be
no facts in the case not known; and,
2d, that there is no other possible hypothesis
on which they can be explained.
We do not say the theories
of the scientists with regard to the
antiquity of the globe and of man on
its surface, nor that any of the geological
and astronomical hypotheses
they set forth are absolutely false; we
only say that their alleged facts and reasonings
do not prove them. The few
facts known might be placed in a
very different light by the possibly unknown
facts; and there are conceivable
any number of other hypotheses
which would equally well explain
the facts that are known.</p>

<p>The book before us on <cite>Hereditary
Genius</cite> admirably illustrates the insufficiency
of the method and the defective
logic of the scientists. Mr.
Galton, its author, belongs to the
school of which such men as Herbert
Spencer, Darwin, Sir John Lubbock,
and Professor Huxley are British
chiefs, men who disdain to recognize
a self-existent Creator, and who see
no difficulty in supposing the universe
self-evolved from nothing, or in tracing
intelligence, will, generous affection,
and heroic effort to the mechanical,
chemical, and electrical arrangement
and combination of the particles
of brute matter. Mr. Galton has
written his book, he says, p. 1, to
show</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"that a man's natural abilities are derived
from inheritance, under exactly the same limitations
as are the form and the physical
features of the whole organic world. Consequently,
as it is easy, notwithstanding
those limitations, to obtain by careful selection
a permanent breed of dogs or horses,
gifted with peculiar powers of running, or
of doing any thing else, so it would be quite
practicable to produce a highly-gifted race
[breed] of men by judicious marriages during
several consecutive generations."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Galton, with an air of the most
perfect innocence in the world, places
man in the category of plants and
animals, and in principle simply reproduces
for our instruction the <i>Man-Plant</i>,
from which there is but a step
to the <i>Man-Machine</i> of the cynical
Lamettrie, the atheistical professor
of mathematics in the university of
Berlin, and friend of Frederick the
Great. The attempt to prove it is a
subtle attempt to prove, in the name
of science, that the soul, if soul there
be, is generated as well as the body,
and that a man's natural abilities are
derived through generation from his
organization. The author from first
to last gives no hint that his doctrine
is at war with Christian theology,
with the freedom of the human will,
or man's moral responsibility for his
conduct, or that it excludes all morality,
all virtue, and all sin, and recognizes
only physical good or evil. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span>
would no doubt reply to this that
science is science, facts are facts, and
he is under no obligation to consider
what theological doctrines they do or
do not contradict; for nothing can
be true that contradicts science or
is opposed to facts. That is opposed
to actual facts, or that contradicts
real science, conceded; for one truth
can never contradict another. But
the author is bound to consider whether
a theory or hypothesis which
contradicts the deepest and most
cherished beliefs of mankind in all
ages and nations, and in which is the
key to universal history, is really science,
or really is sustained by facts.
The presumption, as say the lawyers,
is against it, and for its acceptance it
requires the clearest and the most
irrefragable proofs, and we are not
sure that even any proofs would be
enough to overcome the presumptions
against it, founded as they are
on reasons as strong and as conclusive
as it is in any case possible for the
human mind to have. The assertion
that man's natural abilities originate
in his organization, and therefore that
we may obtain a peculiar breed of
men, as we can obtain a peculiar breed
of dogs or horses, is revolting to the
deepest convictions and the holiest
and most irrepressible instincts of
every man, except a scientist, and
certainly can be reasonably received
only on evidence that excludes the
possibility of a rational doubt.</p>

<p>Mr. Galton proves, or attempts to
prove, his theory by what he no
doubt calls an appeal to facts. He
takes from a biographical dictionary
the names of a few hundreds of men,
chiefly Englishmen, during the last
two centuries, who have been distinguished
as statesmen, lawyers, judges,
divines, authors, etc., and finds that
in a great majority of cases, as far as
is known, they have sprung from families
of more than average ability,
and, in some cases, from families
which have had some one or more
members distinguished for several
consecutive generations. This is really
all the proof Mr. Galton brings to
prove his thesis; and if he has not adduced
more, it is fair to conclude that
it is because no more was to be had.</p>

<p>But the evidence is far from being
conclusive. Even if it be true that
the majority of eminent men spring
from families more or less distinguished,
it does not necessarily follow that
they derive their eminent abilities by
inheritance; for in those same families,
born of the same parents, we
find other members whose abilities
are in no way remarkable, and in no
sense above the common level. In a
family of half a dozen or a dozen members
one will be distinguished and rise
to eminence, while the others will remain
very ordinary people. Of the
Bonaparte family no member approaches
in genius the first Napoleon,
except the present emperor of the
French. Why these marked differences
in the children of the same blood, the
same breed, the same parents and ancestors?
If Mr. Galton explains the
inferiority of the five or the eleven by
considerations external or independent
of race or breed, why may not
the superiority of the one be explained
by causes alike independent of
breed? Why are the natural abilities
of my brothers inferior to mine,
since we are all born of the same
parents? If a man's natural abilities
are derived by inheritance from
organization, why am I superior to
them? Every day we meet occasion
to ask similar questions. This
fact proves that there are causes at
work, on which man's eminence or
want of eminence depends, of which
Mr. Galton's theory takes no note,
which escape the greatest scientists,
and at best can be only conjectured.
But conjecture is not science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span></p>

<p>This is not all. As far as known,
very eminent men have sprung from
parents of very ordinary natural abilities,
as of social position. The founders
of dynasties and noble families
have seldom had distinguished progenitors,
and are usually not only the
first but the greatest of their line.
The present Sir Robert Peel cannot
be named alongside of his really
eminent father, nor the present Duke
of Wellington be compared with his
father, the Iron Duke. There is no
greater name in history than that
of St. Augustine, the eminent father
and doctor of the church, a man
beside whom in genius and depth,
and greatness of mind as well as tenderness
of heart, your Platos and
Aristotles appear like men of only
ordinary stature; yet, though his
mother was eminent for her sanctity,
his parents do not appear to have
been gifted with any extraordinary
mental power. Instances are not
rare, especially among the saints, of
great men who have, so to speak,
sprung from nothing. Among the
popes we may mention Sixtus Quintus,
and Hildebrand, St. Gregory
VII.; and among eminent churchmen
we may mention St. Thomas of
Canterbury, Cardinal Ximenes, and
Cardinal Wolsey. The greatest and
most gifted of our own statesmen
have sprung from undistinguished
parents, as Washington, the elder
Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Jackson,
Webster, Calhoun. Who dares pretend
that every saint has had a saint
for a father or mother; that every
eminent theologian or philosopher
has had any eminent theologian or
philosopher for his father; or that
every eminent artist, whether in painting,
architecture, sculpture, or music,
has been the son or grandson of an
eminent artist?</p>

<p>Then, again, who can say how
much of a great man's greatness is
due to his natural abilities with which
he was born, and how much is due
to the force of example, to family
tradition, to education, to his own
application, and the concurrence of
circumstances? It is in no man's
power to tell, nor in any scientist's
power to ascertain. It is a common
remark that great men in general
owe their greatness chiefly to their
mothers, and that, in the great majority
of cases known, eminent men
have had gifted mothers. This, if a
fact, is against Mr. Galton's theory;
for the father, not the mother, transmits
the hereditary character of the
offspring, the hereditary qualities of
the line, if the physiologists are to be
believed. Hence nobility in all civilized
nations follows the father, not the
mother. The fact of great men
owing their greatness more to the
mother is explained by her greater
influence in forming the mind, in
moulding the character, in stimulating
and directing the exercise of her son's
faculties, than that of the father. It
is as educator in the largest sense
that the mother forms her son's character
and influences his destiny. It
is her womanly instincts, affection,
and care and vigilance, her ready
sympathy, her love, her tenderness,
and power to inspire a noble ambition,
kindle high and generous aspirations
in the breast of her son, that
do the work.</p>

<p>Even if it were uniformly true that
great men have always descended
from parents remarkable for their
natural abilities, Mr. Galton's theory
that genius is hereditary could not
be concluded with scientific certainty.
The hereditary transmission of genius
might indeed seem probable; but, on
the empirical principles of the scientists,
it could not be asserted. All
that could be asserted would be the
relation of concomitance or of juxtaposition,
not the relation of cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[727]</a></span>
and effect. The relation of cause
and effect is not and cannot, as the
scientists tell us, be empirically apprehended.
How can they know
that the genius of the son is derived
hereditarily from the greatness of his
progenitors? From the juxtaposition
or concomitance of two facts
empirically apprehended there is no
possible logic by which it can be inferred
that the one is the cause of the
other. Hence, Mr. Herbert Spencer,
Stuart Mill, Sir William Hamilton,
Professor Huxley, and the positivists
follow Hume, and relegate, as we
said, causes to the region of the unknowable.
In fact, the scientists, if
they speak of the relation of cause
and effect, mean by it only the relation
of juxtaposition in the order of
precedence and consequence. Hence,
on their own principles, though the
facts they assert and describe may be
true, none of their conclusions from
them, or hypotheses to explain them,
have or can have any scientific validity.
For, after all, there may be a
real cause on which the facts depend,
and which demands an entirely different
explanation from the one which
the scientists offer.</p>

<p>We refuse, therefore, to accept Mr.
Galton's hypothesis that genius is
hereditary, because the facts he adduces
are not all the facts in the
case, because there are facts which
are not consistent with it, and because
he does not show and cannot
show that it is the only hypothesis
possible for the explanation even of
the facts which he alleges. Even his
friendly and able reviewer, Dr. Meredith
Clymer, concludes his admirable
analysis by saying, "A larger induction
is necessary before any final decision
can be had on the merits of
the question." This is the verdict of
one of the most scientific minds in
the United States, and it is the Scotch
verdict, not proven. Yet Mr. Galton
would have us accept his theory
as science, and on its strength set
aside the teachings of revelation and
the universal beliefs of mankind.
This is the way of all non-Christian
scientists of the day, and it is because
the church refuses to accept their
unverified and unverifiable hypotheses,
and condemns them for asserting
them as true, that they accuse
her of being hostile to modern science.
They make certain investigations,
ascertain certain facts, imagine
certain hypotheses, which are nothing
but conjectures, put them forth as
science, and then demand that she
accept them, and give up her faith
so far as incompatible with them. A
very reasonable demand indeed!</p>

<p>Press these proud scientists closely,
and they will own that <em>as yet</em> their
sciences are only tentative, that <em>as
yet</em> they are not in a condition to
prove absolutely their theories, or to
verify their conjectures, but they are
in hopes they soon will be. At present,
science is only in its infancy, it
has only just entered upon the true
method of investigation; but it is
every day making surprising progress,
and there is no telling what marvellous
conclusions it will soon arrive at.
All this might pass, if it did not concern
matters of life and death, heaven
and hell. The questions involved
are too serious to be sported with,
too pressing to wait the slow and
uncertain solutions of the tentative
science which, during six thousand
years, has really made no progress
in solving them. The scientists retard
science when they ask from it
the solution, either affirmative or negative,
of questions which confessedly
lie not in its province, and dishonor
and degrade it when they put
forth as science their crude conjectures,
or their unverified and unverifiable
hypotheses. They, not we, are
the real enemies of science, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[728]</a></span>
would require a miracle to make
them see it. Deluded mortals! they
start with assumptions that exclude
the very possibility of science, and
then insist that what they assert or
deny shall be accepted by theologians
and philosophers as established
with scientific certainty! Surely the
apostle must have had them in mind
when he said of certain men that,
"esteeming themselves wise, they became
fools."</p>

<p>Genius is not hereditary in Mr.
Galton's sense, nor are a man's natural
abilities derived by inheritance in
the way he would have us believe;
for both belong to the soul, not to the
body; and the soul is created, not generated.
Only the body is generated,
and only in what is generated is there
natural inheritance. All the facts Mr.
Galton adduces we are prepared to
admit; but we deny his explanation.
We accept, with slight qualifications,
his views as summed up by Dr. Clymer
in the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The doctrine of the pretensions of natural
equality in intellect, which teaches that
the sole agencies in creating differences between
boy and boy, and man and man, are
steady application and moral effort, is daily
contradicted by the experiences of the nursery,
schools, universities, and professional
careers. There is a definite limit to the muscular
powers of every man, which he cannot
by any training or exertion overpass. It is
only the novice gymnast who, noting his rapid
daily gain of strength and skill, believes
in illimitable development; but he learns in
time that his maximum performance becomes
a rigidly-determinate quantity. The same
is true of the experience of the student in
the working of his mental powers. The eager
boy at the outset of his career is astonished
at his rapid progress; he thinks for a
while that every thing is within his grasp;
but he too soon finds his place among his
fellows; he can beat such and such of his
mates, and run on equal terms with others,
while there will be always some whose intellectual
and physical feats he cannot approach.
The same experience awaits him
when he enters a larger field of competition
in the battle of life; let him work with all
his diligence, he cannot reach his object; let
him have opportunities, he cannot profit by
them; he tries and is tried, and he finally
learns his gauge&mdash;what he can do, and what
lies beyond his capacity. He has been taught
the hard lesson of his weakness and his
strength; he comes to rate himself as the
world rates him; and he salves his wounded
ambition with the conviction that he is doing
all his nature allows him. An evidence of
the enormous inequality between the intellectual
capacity of men is shown in the prodigious
differences in the number of marks
obtained by those who gain mathematical
honors at the University of Cambridge, England.
Of the four hundred or four hundred
and fifty students who take their degrees each
year, about one hundred succeed in gaining
honors in mathematics, and these are ranged
in strict order of merit. Forty of them
have the title of 'wrangler,' and to be even
a low wrangler is a creditable thing. The
distinction of being the first in this list of
honors, or 'senior wrangler' of the year,
means a great deal more than being the foremost
mathematician of four hundred or four
hundred and fifty men taken at haphazard.
Fully one half the wranglers have been boys
of mark at their schools. The senior wrangler
of the year is the chief of these as regards
mathematics. The youths start on
their three-years' race fairly, and their run
is stimulated by powerful inducements; at
the end they are examined rigorously for
five and a half hours a day for eight days.
The marks are then added up, and the candidates
strictly rated in a scale of merit.
The precise number of marks got by the
senior wrangler, in one of the three years
given by Mr. Galton, is 7634; by the second
wrangler, 4123; and by the lowest man in
the list of honors, 237. The senior wrangler,
consequently, had nearly twice as many
marks as the second, and more than thirty-two
times as many as the lowest man. In
the other examinations given, the results do
not materially differ. The senior wrangler
may, therefore, be set down as having thirty-two
times the ability of the lowest men on
the lists; or, as Mr. Galton puts it, 'he
would be able to grapple with problems more
than thirty-two times as difficult; or, when
dealing with subjects of the same difficulty,
but intelligible to all, would comprehend
them more rapidly in, perhaps, the square-root
of that proportion.' But the mathematical
powers of the ultimate man on the
honors-list, which are so low when compared
with those of the foremost man, are above
mediocrity when compared with the gifts of
Englishmen generally; for, though the examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[729]</a></span>
places one hundred honor-men
above him, it puts no less than three hundred
'poll-men' below him. Admitting
that two hundred out of three hundred have
refused to work hard enough to earn honors,
there will remain one hundred who, had they
done their possible, never could have got
them.</p>

<p>"The same striking intellectual differences
between man and man are found in whatever
way ability may be tested, whether in
statesmanship, generalship, literature, science,
poetry, art. The evidence furnished
by Mr. Galton's book goes to show in how
small degree eminence in any class of intellectual
powers can be considered as due to
purely special faculties. It is the result of
concentrated efforts made by men widely
gifted&mdash;of grand human animals; of natures
born to achieve greatness."</p></blockquote>

<p>We are far from pretending that all
men are born with equal abilities, and
that all souls are created with equal
possibilities, or that every child comes
into the world a genius in germ. We
believe that all men are born with
equal natural rights, and that all
should be equal before the law, however
various and unequal may be their
acquired or adventitious rights; but
that is all the equality we believe in.
No special effort or training in the
world, under the influence of the most
favorable circumstances, can make
every child a St. Augustine, a St. Thomas,
a Bossuet, a Newton, a Leibnitz,
a Julius CÃ¦sar, a Wellington, a Napoleon.
As one star differeth from
another in glory, so does one soul differ
from another in its capacities on
earth as well as in its blessedness in
heaven. Here we have no quarrel
with Mr. Galton. We are by no
means believers in the late Robert
Owen's doctrine, that you can make
all men equal if you will only surround
them from birth with the same circumstances,
and enable them to live in
parallelograms.</p>

<p>We are prepared to go even farther,
and to recognize that the distinction
between noble and ignoble, gentle and
simple, recognized in all ages and by
all nations, is not wholly unfounded.
There is as great a variety and as
great an inequality in families as in
individuals. Aristocracy is not a pure
prejudice; and though it has no political
privileges in this country, yet it
exists here no less than elsewhere, and
it is well for us that it does. No greater
evil could befall any country than
to have no distinguished families rising,
generation after generation, above
the common level; no born leaders of
the people, who stand head and shoulders
above the rest; and the great
objection to democracy is, that it tends
to bring all down to a general average,
and to place the administration of
public interests in the hands of a low
mediocrity, as our American experience,
in some measure, proves. The
demand of the age for equality of conditions
and possessions is most mischievous.
If all were equally rich, all
would be equally poor; and if all were
at the top of society, society would
have no bottom, and would be only a
bottomless pit. If there were none
devoted to learning, no strength and
energy of character above the multitude,
society would be without leaders,
and would soon fall to pieces, as
an army of privates without officers.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that there are
noble lines, and the descendants of
noble ancestors do, as a rule, though
not invariably, surpass the descendants
of plebeian or undistinguished
lines. The Stanleys, for instance,
have been distinguished in British history
for at least fifteen generations.
The present Earl Derby, the fifteenth
earl of his house, is hardly inferior to
his gifted father, and nobly sustains
the honors of his house. We expect
more from the child of a good family
than from the child of a family of no
account, and hold that birth is never
to be decried or treated as a matter
of no importance. But we count it
so chiefly because it secures better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span>
breeding, and subjection to higher,
nobler, and purer formative influences,
from the earliest moment. Example
and family traditions are of immense
reach in forming the character, and it
is not a little to have constantly presented
to the consideration of the
child the distinguished ability, the
eminent worth and noble deeds of a
long line of illustrious ancestors, especially
in an age and country where
blood is highly esteemed, and the honorable
pride of family is cultivated.
The honor and esteem in which a
family has been held for its dignity
and worth through several generations
is a capital, an outfit for the son, secures
him, in starting, the advantage
of less well-born competitors, and all
the aid in advance of a high position
and the good-will of the community.
More is exacted of him than of them;
he is early made to feel that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse
oblige</i>, and that failure would in his
case be dishonor. He is thereby stimulated
to greater effort to succeed.</p>

<p>Yet we deny not that there is something
else than all this in blood. A
man's genius belongs to his soul, and
is no more inherited than the soul
itself. But man is not all soul, any
more than he is all body; body and
soul are in close and mysterious relation,
and in this life neither acts without
the other. The man's natural
abilities are psychical, not physical,
and are not inherited, because the
soul is created, not generated; but
their external manifestation may depend,
in a measure, on organization,
and organization is inherited. Mr.
Galton's facts may, then, be admitted
without our being obliged to accept
his theory. The brain is generally
considered by physiologists as the organ
of the mind, and it may be so,
without implying that the brain secretes
thought, will, affection, as the liver secretes
bile, or the stomach secretes the
gastric juice.</p>

<p>The soul is distinct from the body,
and is its <em>form</em>, its life, or its vivifying
and informing principle; yet it uses
the body as the organ of its action.
Hence, De Bonald defines man, an
intelligence that serves himself by organs,
not an intelligence served by
organs, as Plato said. The activity is
in the soul, not in the organs. The
organ we call the eye does not see; the
soul sees by means of the eye. So
of the ear, the smell, the taste, the
touch. We speak of the five senses;
but we should speak more correctly
if we spoke, not of five senses, but of
five organs of sense; for the sense is
psychical, and is one like the soul that
senses through the organs. In like
manner, the brain appears to be the
organ of the mind, through which, together
with the several nerves that
centre in it, the mind performs its
various operations of thinking, willing,
reasoning, remembering, reflecting,
etc. The nature of the relation of
the soul, which is one, simple, and
immaterial, with a material body with
its various organs, nervous and ganglionic
systems, is a mystery which
we cannot explain. Yet we cannot
doubt that there is a reciprocal action
and reaction of the soul and body,
or, at least, the bodily organs can and
do offer, at times, an obstacle to the
external action of the soul. I cannot
by my will raise my arm, if it be paralyzed,
though my psychical power
to will to raise it is not thereby affected.
If the organs of seeing and hearing,
the eye and the ear, are injured
or originally defective, my external
sight and hearing are thereby injured
or rendered defective; but not in other
psychical relations, as evinced by
the fact that when the physical defect
is removed, or the physical injury is
cured, the soul finds no difficulty in
manifesting its ordinary power of seeing
or hearing. So we may say of the
other organs of sense, and of the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[731]</a></span>
generally, in so far as it is the organ
of the soul, or used by the soul
in its external display or manifestation
of its powers.</p>

<p>No doubt the organization may be
more or less favorable to this external
display or manifestation, or that, under
certain conditions, and to a certain
extent, the organization is hereditary,
or transmitted by natural generation.
There may be transmitted from parents
or ancestors a healthy or diseased,
a normal or a more or less
abnormal organization; and so far,
and in this sense, genius may be hereditary,
and a man's natural abilities
may be derived by inheritance, as are
the form and features; but only to this
extent, and in this sense&mdash;that is, as to
their external display or exercise; for
a man may be truly eloquent in his
soul, and even in writing, whose stammering
tongue prevents him from displaying
any eloquence in his speech.
The organization does not deprive
the soul of its powers. My power to
will to raise my arm is not lessened
by the fact that my arm is paralyzed.
And in all ordinary cases, the soul is
able, at least by the help of grace,
freely given to all, to overcome a vicious
temperament, control, in the
moral order, a defective organization,
and maintain her moral freedom and
integrity. It has been proved that
the deaf-mute can be taught to speak,
and that idiots or natural-born fools
can be so educated as to be able to
exhibit no inconsiderable degree of
intelligence.</p>

<p>We do not believe a word in Darwin's
theory of natural selection; for
all the facts on which he bases it admit
of a different explanation, nor in
its kindred theory of development or
evolution of species. One of our own
collaborators has amply refuted both
theories, by showing that what these
theories assume to be the development
or evolution of new species, whether
by natural selection or otherwise, is
but a reversion to the original type
and condition, in like manner as we
have proved, over and over again,
that the savage is the degenerate, not
the primeval man. It is not improbable
that your African negro is the
degenerate descendant of a once over-civilized
race, and that he owes his
physical peculiarities to the fact that
he has become subject, like the animal
world, to the laws of nature, which
are resisted and modified in their action
by the superior races. We do
not assert this as scientifically demonstrated,
but as a theory which is far
better sustained by well-known facts
and incontrovertible principles than
either the theory of development or
of natural selection.</p>

<p>Yet the soul as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forma corporis</i> has
an influence, we say not how much,
on organization; and high intellectual
and moral culture may modify it,
and, other things being equal, render
it in turn more favorable to the external
manifestation of the inherent
powers of the soul. This more favorable
organization may be transmitted
by natural generation from
parents to children, and, if continued
through several consecutive generations,
it may give rise to noble families
and to races superior to the
average. Physical habits are transmissible
by inheritance. This is not,
as Darwin and Mr. Galton suppose,
owing to natural selection, but to the
original mental and moral culture
become traditional in certain families
and races, and to the voluntary
efforts of the soul, as is evident from
the fact that when the culture is neglected,
and the voluntary efforts
cease to be made, the superiority is
lost, the organization becomes depraved,
and the family or race runs
out or drops into the ranks of the
ignoble. The blood, however blue,
will not of itself alone suffice to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
up the superiority of the family or
the race; nor will marriages, however
judicious, through no matter how
many consecutive generations, without
the culture, keep up the nobility,
as Mr. Galton would have us believe;
for the superiority of the blood depends
originally and continuously on
the soul, its original endowments,
and its peculiar training or culture
through several generations.</p>

<p>It is in this same way we explain
the origin and continuance of national
characteristics and differences. Climate
and geographical position count,
no doubt, for something; but more in
the direction they give to the national
aims and culture than in their direct
effects on bodily organization. It is
not probable that the original tribes
of Greece had any finer organic
adaptation to literature and the arts
than had the Scythian hordes from
which they sprang; but their climate
and geographical position turned
their attention to cultivation of the
beautiful, and the continual cultivation
of the beautiful through several
generations gave the Greeks an organization
highly favorable to artistic
creations. Then, again, Rome cultivated
and excelled in the genius of
law and jurisprudence. But under
Christian faith and culture, the various
nations of Europe became assimilated,
and the peculiar national characteristics
under Gentilism were in a
measure obliterated. They also revive
as the nations under Protestantism
recede from Christianity and return
to Gentilism, and are held in
check only by the reminiscences of
Catholicity, and by the mutual intercourse
of nations kept up by trade
and commerce, literature and the arts.</p>

<p>The facts alleged by Mr. Galton
and his brother materialists are, therefore,
explicable without impugning
the doctrine of the simplicity and immateriality
of the soul, and that the
soul is created, not generated as is
the body. They are perfectly explicable
without supposing our natural
abilities originate in or are the result
of natural organization. They can
be explained in perfect consistency
with revelation, with the teachings
of the church, and with the universal
beliefs of mankind. Thus it would
be supreme unreason to require us to
reject the Gospel, or our holy religion,
on the strength of the unverified
and unverifiable hypotheses of the
scientists, and degrade man, the lord
of this lower creation, to the level of
the beasts that perish. The quarrel
we began by speaking of is in no
sense a quarrel between faith and reason,
or revelation and science; but
simply a quarrel between what is
certain by faith and reason on the
one side, and the unverified and unverifiable
hypotheses or conjectures
of the so-called scientists on the
other. We oppose none of the real
facts which the scientists set forth;
we oppose only their unsupported
theories and unwarranted inductions.
We conclude by reminding the scientists
that others have studied nature
as well as they, and are as familiar
with its facts and as able to reason
on them as they are, and yet
have no difficulty in reconciling their
science and their faith.</p>

<h2>DION AND THE SIBYLS.<br />

<small>A CLASSIC, CHRISTIAN NOVEL.</small></h2>

<p class="center">BY MILES GERALD KEON, COLONIAL SECRETARY, BERMUDA, AUTHOR OF
"HARDING THE MONEY-SPINNER," ETC.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>Two days afterward, Dionysius
the Athenian called at the inn, and
informed Aglais, Paulus, and Agatha,
that after the banquet in the Mamurran
palace at FormiÃ¦, that evening,
there was to be a great gathering of
the witty, the noble, the fashionable,
and the wise, and that he was charged
to invite Aglais and her two children
as friends of his.</p>

<p>Aglais declined the honor for herself
and her daughter, but said she
wished Paulus to go with Dionysius.
Paulus, therefore, laid aside the outlandish
costume in which he had travelled
from Thessaly, and dressed
himself with care in the fashion suitable
to a young Roman of equestrian
rank. Dionysius remained to join
the family in their repast, which was
virtually what we should in modern
times call the early dinner, after which
the two friends mounted Dion's chariot,
and proceeded toward FormiÃ¦
at an easy pace, along the smooth
pavement of the "queen of roads."</p>

<p>During the drive they had a conversation
which was, for good reasons,
very interesting to Paulus.</p>

<p>"A most capricious course," said
Dionysius, "is your suit or claim running.
In seeking to recover your
family estates you prudently avoid at
first bringing the holder into a court
of law; for the judges might shrink
from voiding a title which not only
arises out of an express gift of Augustus,
but is identical with the title
under which half the land of Italy
has been held since the battle of Philippi.
Instead of an immediate lawsuit,
therefore, you try a direct appeal
to Augustus, offering to show him
that at the very time when your father's
estate was taken away he had
just rendered the same services for
which, had he been willing to accept
it, he would, like so many others, have
had a right to be endowed with a new
estate, taken from some member of
the defeated party. But Augustus
refers you back to the courts, where, for
the two reasons mentioned, you fear the
result. But two other reasons might
be added for fearing it still more: first,
the present holder is dreaded on account
of his political power and his
station; Tiberius is the man who, by
marrying the daughter of Agrippa
Vipsanius, has come into possession
of your property; secondly, wealth is
necessary for the success of such a
suit; wealth he has, and wealth you
have not. The courts present, consequently,
but small hopes; yet you
fail to get Augustus to decide your
case himself.</p>

<p>"Have I correctly stated the position
of your affairs?"</p>

<p>"To a nicety," replied Paulus.
"Had I interest at court, I should
find justice there."</p>

<p>"In your case," said Dionysius,
"interest <i>at court</i> would be equivalent
to justice <i>in the courts</i>. As I took
precisely this view of the business,
and as Augustus has paid me such
honor, and shown me such partiality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[734]</a></span>
as few have found with him for many
years, it occurred to me that if I threw
my unclaimed and unexpected <i>interest</i>
into the same scale wherein your just
demands already lay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah kind and generous friend!"
interrupted Paulus; "I understand."</p>

<p>"Not so kind, nor so generous,"
replied Dionysius, "to my friend
Paulus, as I saw Paulus show himself
to be the day before yesterday to
a stranger and a slave. But hear me
out. No sooner did I tell Augustus
that I had a favor to ask of him, than
he placed his hand on my mouth,
and said, 'I like to hear you talk; but
mine has been too busy a life to permit
me to draw forth by properly opposing
you the full force of your own
opinions&mdash;<span class="smcap">OR THE TRUTH</span>. The truth
in these matters (not your affair, Paulus,
but philosophy) is the only truth
which can interest a man about to die.
You must state these views in the
presence of young, vigorous, and not
preoccupied intellects. If you hold
your own as well against what they
can allege as against my objections,
submit to me afterward your petition.
One thing at a time.' This and the
like, with the indomitable whim and
obstinate waywardness of age, he has
continued to fling at me, whenever I
have renewed the attempt to state
your case; and I have done so five
or six times. Titus Livy and Quintus
Haterius, whom I have consulted, advise
me to take literally and in the spirit
of downright business this curious
caprice. Now, do you know, to-night
is appointed for a sort of arena-fight?
All the gladiatorial intellects of the
west are to be arrayed to crush the
fantastic theories and pretty delusions
of a Greek, an Athenian. All motives
chain me, all pledges prevent me;
moreover, honor and truth, to say
nothing, my friend, of your own personal
future, interdict me from flight."</p>

<p>"Flight!" cried Paulus; "<em>you</em> fly?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Dionysius; "you know
not all that I mean. You and I have
been differently reared, yet in the
same spirit. However, as you said,
when at the risk of your own life you
stood between oppression and an innocent
young couple, the great Being
whom we both expect will be
pleased with a willing effort after what
is right.</p>

<p>"But here we are at the gates of
FormiÃ¦. How the palace of the
Mamurras glitters! How these narrow
streets flare with torches! We
must go at a walk. Charioteer, let
the litters pass first. Yes, my friend,
in the painful position in which I shall
be forced to stand to-night, (and I
blush beforehand, knowing my incompetence,
my ignorance, and the
intrinsic difficulty of what I am expected
to do,) your future fortunes
and the rights of your family are by
a strange caprice made dependent
upon the success with which I may
be able to defend ideas of general and
unchangeable value, beauty, and truth;
ideas which it debases a man not to
have, and exalts him to entertain;
ideas which were always dear to the
greatest minds that have preceded us,
and which are reflected in every calm
and pure soul, as the stars in fair,
sweet lakes, although the putrid, slimy
pool, and the waters tossed with
storms, and an atmosphere darkened
with clouds, may forbid the image, by
intercepting the heavenly light or defacing
the earthly mirror."</p>

<p>While Dionysius thus informed
Paulus of the singular and close connection
which had arisen between the
future prospects of his mother, his
sister, and himself, as well as the establishment
of their rights, and the success
with which Dionysius might this
night be able to make good his philosophical
doctrines against the wits, the
orators, and the sophists of the Augustan
court, at the same moment Tiberius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
was conversing upon the same
subject with Domitius Afer and Antistius
Labio in a room of the Mamurran
palace.</p>

<p>"Just," said he, in continuation of
a conversation previously commenced,
"as if a person's claim to an estate
could be rendered either better or
worse by the style of his horsemanship!"</p>

<p>Here Domitius Afer laughed heartily,
and showed his admiration of
CÃ¦sar's wit. Labio, a saturnine, laborious
man, son of one of the assassins
of Julius CÃ¦sar, and author of
numberless works, preserved a grim,
unsmiling air, as he observed,</p>

<p>"A man may ride over an estate,
and over all its hedges and ditches;
but he must be no bad rider if he can
jump his horse into a title to become
its proprietor."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, the infatuation of
Augustus for the Greek friend of the
claimant is such that if the Athenian
acquits himself successfully to-night
in the MÃ¦cenas-like criticisms and
Plato-like discussions which are, I
suspect, to vary our entertainments,
he will next suffer the golden-tongued
youth to state the case of Paulus
Lepidus Ãmilius. The effect at
which you must aim is to make a fool
of the Athenian; and you are the
men to do it. Refute every thing he
says, ridicule him, cover him with
confusion; make him the gibe of the
whole court, the derision of the brilliant
circle assembling here to-night.
Put an end to his influence. We want
no more mind-battles in Italy. I set
dogs upon a dog. Arouse all your
attention. Bend all your energies.
Let the stranger retire from among
us in disgrace."</p>

<p>That night, the most brilliant company
which could then be culled out
of the human race was assembled in
the central impluvium of the Mamurran
palace and its arcades. Lamps,
hanging from the festoons of creeping
plants which adorned and connected
the porphyry pillars of the colonnades,
mingled their gleam with the light of
the moon and stars. The variety of
rays, of shadows, and of coloring
which were thus sprinkled over the
flowers, the leaves, the walls and
pillars, the faces, figures, and dresses,
produced a scene which a painter
could better render than words can.
The central fountain was smitten into
a sorcery of tints, as it shed into a
large basin of green marble the drooping
sheaf of waters, of which the materials
were perpetually changing, and
the form and outlines perfectly maintained,
or instantly and perpetually
renewed.</p>

<p>The Emperor, and the CÃ¦sars,
Tiberius and Germanicus, with the famous
authors we have already more
than once mentioned, Livy, and Lucius
Varius, and Velleius Paterculus
were present. Ãlius Sejanus, the
prefect of the PrÃ¦torians; Cneius
Piso, the gambler; Plancina, his rich
wife; Lucius Piso, his brother, governor
of Rome; with many persons
who then sparkled in the court orbits,
but whose names have perished out
of human memory; and Julia, the
emperor's daughter, Tiberius's new
wife; and Agrippina Vipsania, lately
his wife; and Agrippina Julia, daughter
of the former, sister of the latter,
wife of Germanicus, and mother of
Caligula; and Livia, the aged wife of
Augustus himself, all appeared among
the guests. Chairs and couches had
been placed here and there. Augustus
and the ladies we have mentioned
were seated, some just within, others
just without one of the arcades, between
two of its columns, so that the
moonlight fell upon some heads, the
lamplight upon others; and a wayward,
dubious mixture of both upon
the golden tresses of Agrippina Julia,
and of a beautiful young girl near her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[736]</a></span>
on whom Domitius Afer, the celebrated
orator, was gazing with admiration.
But she, when she at last observed
his glance, fixed upon him
such a look of combined scorn and
amazement that the advocate winced
and became livid. She was destined,
one day, to be the subject of his fatal
eloquence, and to appease by nothing
less than her execution the
vindictive vanity of the <i>orator</i>, because
she had spurned the ambitious
love of the man.</p>

<p>Tacitus alludes to the poor Claudia
Pulchra's brief tale. Quintus Haterius,
whose Shakespeare-like variety
of mind and bewitching eloquence
had, as Ben Jonson implies in a comparison
already cited by us, few rivals,
was seated not far from Augustus.
Next sat Livy. Antistius Labio and
his rival Domitius Afer, who now
occupied the place and fame in the
forum from which Haterius on account
of his age had withdrawn, stood
leaning against a pillar, each with his
arms folded. Both these persons, as
well as Livy and Haterius, wore the
toga; Sejanus, the scarlet <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paludamentum</i>.
The other male guests&mdash;except
Tiberius, whose dark purple robe was
conspicuous, and Germanicus, who
was dressed in the costume of a commander-in-chief&mdash;wore
a species of
large tunic, called <i>lacerna</i>, which
(contrary to the taste of the emperor,
and despite of his frequently expressed
disapproval) had become fashionable.
The story mentioned by Suetonius is
well known. One day Augustus, seeing
numbers of the people wearing the
<i>lacerna</i>, asked indignantly, in a line
of Virgil's, could these be Romans,
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romanos rerum dominos</i>, <span class="smcap">GENTEMQUE
TOGATAM</span>," and ordered the Ã¦diles
to admit none but toga-wearers
into either the forum or the circus.
But this was many years before the
evening with which we are now engaged.</p>

<p>Among the groups collected in the
Mamurran palace were representatives
of the three great arts, in mastering
which the highest education of
classic antiquity was exhausted; we
mean the arts of politics, of public
speaking, and of strategy&mdash;government,
eloquence, and war. They
were all represented, each of them
had its proper image in the groups
we have described. As those pursuits
constituted the favorite intellectual
sphere, and comprehended all the
fields of ambition, to be eminent in
any one of them was to succeed in
life, and to be adopted into that class
of society of which so many distinguished
members were entertained
in the Formian palace on the night
at which our tale has arrived.</p>

<p>If a man excelled, like Julius CÃ¦sar,
in all the three arts named, he
could revolutionize the world. The
mechanic arts, the fine arts, philosophy,
physical science, mathematics, attracted
individual votaries indeed;
but were neglected by the ambition
of a few, as well as by the indolence
of many.</p>

<p>The mention of physical studies recalls
Strabo, the geographer, who was
among the guests this evening at the
palace.</p>

<p>Many others who were there we
need not enumerate; but some will
claim a word and a glance. When
Dionysius arrived, and introduced
Paulus to the aged knight, Mamurra,
the company was already numerous.
Mamurra patted Paulus on the shoulder,
and said, although the other
day in the road he had not at once
recalled old times, he remembered
Paulus's brave father very well at the
battle of Philippi; and that he, Mamurra,
had seen him and Agrippa
Vipsanius together, rallying the wing
which Mark Antony had broken, and
that he himself had charged with the
cavalry to help him. This speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[737]</a></span>
was very gracious, and our hero, who
well knew it to be true, blushed with
pride and pleasure. While the glow
of this natural and honorable emotion
was still coloring his young face,
as he bowed to Mamurra, the latter
took him by the arm, and said in a
low voice,</p>

<p>"Come, let an old soldier present
the son of a former comrade, whose
life was honorable, and whose memory
is glorious, to the master for whom
they both fought with equal zeal, although
unequal fortune."</p>

<p>Augustus returned Paulus's low
salutation with a faint yet not unkindly
smile, and then looked with a sort
of sleepy steadiness at Tiberius, who
heard Mamurra's words, and whose
face was apparently flaming with a
dark red rage. Near Tiberius, who
now threw himself upon the cushions
of a couch plated with gold, just opposite
the chair which Augustus had
selected, stood a tall, regular-featured,
Brahmin-like man, in Asiatic dress,
and next to this individual, Sejanus,
with his usual air of supercilious composure,
yet intent watchfulness.</p>

<p>The couch we have mentioned
was long and large, and two ladies,
one old, the other young, were already
sitting at the further end of it.
The first was Antonia, the mother of
Germanicus, the second was Agrippina
Julia, his wife. Just in front of
them, upon a low stool, sat the son
of the latter, Caius Caligula, with his
eyes yet bandaged, as the reader will
not be surprised to hear; while at his
side, fidgeting with large, red, lubberly
hands, stood a big, loutish, heavy-looking
boy, who was considerably
the senior of that dear child. This
was no other than Claudius, the fourth
of the CÃ¦sarian dynasty, (or the fifth,
if Julius CÃ¦sar be accounted the first,)
reserved, against his will, to mount
the throne of the world amid panic
and horror, that day when Caligula
shall be hacked to pieces by Cassius
ChÃ¦rias, in the theatre of the palace
at Rome.</p>

<p>Thus, three future rulers of mankind,
destined to bear dire sceptres in
dark and evil days, were around the
white hairs of Augustus CÃ¦sar to-night.</p>

<p>As Paulus stepped backward after
Augustus's languid but not unkindly
reception of him, Dionysius, who was
just behind, moved quickly and gracefully
out of his way, and Claudius,
the big, loutish lad, being impelled
thereto by the nature of him, shuffled
forward so as to come in collision
with Paulus.</p>

<p>"Monster!" exclaimed Antonia,
ashamed of her son's awkwardness;
"if I wanted to prove any one void
of all mind, I would call him more
stupid than you!"<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Paulus glided into the background,
saying with a bow and a smile, "<em>My</em>
fault!"</p>

<p>He now found himself in the immediate
neighborhood of that eastern
group which his young sister had described
as presenting themselves one
morning at the entrance of the bower
in the inn garden, when she was there
listening to the strange conversation
of Plancina; we mean Queen Berenice
and her daughter Herodias, and
her son Herod Agrippa.</p>

<p>They all three fixed their gaze upon
him with that unabashed, hardy manner
peculiar to the family, and Paulus
was beginning to feel uncomfortable
in their vicinity and under their
scrutiny, when Germanicus CÃ¦sar approached,
and complimenting him
upon his brilliant exploit two evenings
before, asked him whether he would
like to join the expedition which was
to start next day to drive the Germans
from the north-east of Italy?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span></p>
<p>If he would, Germanicus offered to
mount him splendidly, and keep him
near his own person, and make him
the bearer of orders to the generals;
in modern phrase, give him a place on
the staff. Paulus thanked the commander-in-chief
briefly and respectfully,
and asked to be allowed to wait till
noon next day before giving a more
definite answer than that he should
rejoice to accept the gracious offer;
his mother and sister had no protector
except himself, and he should not
like to leave them, without first hearing
what they said. Germanicus assented.</p>

<p>During the short conversation of
which this was the substance, Germanicus
had moved slowly up the
gravel-walk; and Paulus of course attended
him, listening and answering,
not sorry besides to put some space
between himself and the unpleasant
Jewish group. By the time they had
finished speaking they had arrived
opposite the couch where Tiberius,
Antonia, and Agrippina were seated,
with Germanicus's child, Caligula, as
we have described, occupying a low
stool in front of his mother Agrippina.
Close by, leaning against a pillar,
stood a youth in the uniform of a
centurion who had a most determined,
thoughtful countenance.</p>

<p>On the approach of Germanicus, he
briskly quitted his lounging attitude
to salute his commander.</p>

<p>"Young knight," said Germanicus
to Paulus, "let me make you acquainted
with as brave a youth, I
think, as can be found in all the Roman
legions; this is <i>Cassius ChÃ¦rias</i>."</p>

<p>"Who, father," asked the shrill
voice of the child Caligula, "is the
brave youth, do you say?"</p>

<p>"<i>Cassius ChÃ¦rias.</i>"</p>

<p>"Are you so brave?" persisted the
impudent child, shoving up his bandage
impatiently, and disclosing a
truly disfigured and malicious little
face.</p>

<p>"I can't see you, or what you are
like. But I think I could make you
afraid if I was emperor."</p>

<p>The man destined hereafter to deliver
mankind from the boundless profligacy,
the wicked oppression, and
the insane, raging, incredible cruelties
of which it was daily the miserable
victim by killing Caligula the emperor,
looked steadily at Caligula the
child, and said not a word.</p>

<p>"I should like to feel your sword,
whether it is heavy," pursued the
child. "Give it me." And he started
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Silence! pert baby," said Germanicus,
pushing him back into his
place.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Augustus,
looking round, and there was an instantaneous
hush of general conversation
as he did so; "that we have
represented around us Europe, Asia,
and Africa. Young Herod and his
friends may count for Asia."</p>

<p>"You," added Augustus, addressing
the tall, Brahmin-like man who
stood near Tiberius, "come from
Egypt, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Mighty emperor," returned the
other in measured and sepulchral
tones, "I come from the land where
great Babylon once was the seat of
empire."</p>

<p>No sooner had this man opened
his mouth than the observant Sejanus
started.</p>

<p>Approaching his mouth to the
other's ear, he whispered,</p>

<p>"I have heard your voice before;
you are&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied the other, composedly
eyeing his questioner, "Thrasyllus
Magus&mdash;Thrasyllus, the student
of the stars."</p>

<p>Sejanus smiled, twisted his moustache
in his white fingers, and asked,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[739]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you sure that you are not
the god Hermes? and that you do
not sometimes ride of nights, with
your horse's hoofs wrapped in cloth?"</p>

<p>It was now the other's turn to
start.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," pursued Sejanus,
still in a whisper, "that I had
not every stable in FormiÃ¦ searched
the night you played that trick on
the road? I know my master Tiberius's
taste for divination and the
various deep things you practice.
You, then, are the oracle who reveals
to him the decrees of fate?"</p>

<p>The exchange of further remarks
between these worthy men was here
suspended; for Augustus again spoke
amid general attention.</p>

<p>"I think," said he, "that we should
all now be glad to hear Dionysius
the Athenian." An eager hum of
assent and approval arose from the
jaded and sated, but inquisitive and
critical society around.</p>

<p>"There are in your philosophy,"
continued Augustus, "two leading
principles, my Athenian, in support
of which I am both curious and
anxious to hear you advance some
solid and convincing reasons. You
despise, as Cicero despised it, the notion
of a plurality of gods. You
affirm there is only one. You say
that a god who could begin to be a
god, or begin at all, can be no god;
and that the true King of all kings, is
the giver of whatever exists, and the
recipient of nothing. That he is
without a body, a pure and holy intelligence.
That as every thing else
is his work, there never were, and
never will be, and never could be,
any limits either of his power or of
his knowledge. At the same time,
you reject the notion, adopted in
some Greek systems, that he is the
soul of the visible universe, and this
universe his body; affirming him to
be antecedent to and independent of
all things, and all other things to be
absolutely dependent upon him.</p>

<p>"Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dionysius; "such
is my assured conviction."</p>

<p>"This, then," said Augustus, "is
the first question upon which I wish
to hear you; and the second is, whether
that force or principle within
each of us which thinks, reflects, reasons,
and is conscious of itself, will
perish at our death, or will live beyond
it, and is of such a nature that
it will never perish, as Plato, Xenophon,
Cicero, and many other illustrious
men and very great thinkers
have so ardently contended."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Dionysius, in a voice
indescribably sweet and thrilling,
while all turned their eyes toward
him; "unless that God himself assist
me, I shall be quite unequal to
the task you impose upon me, Augustus.
I am not worthy to treat
the subject upon which you desire
me to speak. You are aware that
many learned persons in our Europe
expect, and for a long time have expected,
some divine being to appear
one day among men. I see the able
governor of Rome, Lucius Piso.
None will accuse Piso of credulity,
none suppose him a weaver of idle
fancies, or a dreamer of gratuitous
reveries. An able administrator, an
accomplished man of the world, and,
if he will pardon me, more inclined
to be too sarcastic than too indulgent,
he, nevertheless, despises not
this expectation. Our learned friend
Strabo, whom I see near me, will tell
you moreover how it prevails, and
has from immemorial times prevailed,
in various and often perverted forms,
yet with an underlying essence of
permanent identity, among the innumerable
nations which make some
thirty languages resound through the
immense expanses of Asia. But Domitius
Afer desires to interrupt me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[740]</a></span></p>

<p>Afer said,</p>

<p>"I do not discern how this ancient
and mysterious expectation which
floats vaguely through the traditions of
all mankind, and in a more definite
shape forms the groundwork for the
whole religion of the Jewish nation,
can be at all connected either with the
immortality of the thinking principle
inside of us, or with the question
whether there is one supreme, absolute,
and eternal God who made this
universe."</p>

<p>"All I would have added," replied
Dionysius, "in regard to that expectation
was, that after the appearance
of this universal benefactor, many
sublime ideas which hitherto only the
strongest intellects have entertained,
will probably become familiar to the
meanest&mdash;common to all.</p>

<p>"I pass to the two questions which
Augustus desires to hear argued;
and, first, let me collect the opinions
of this brilliant company; I will then
compare them with mine. What
does Antistius Labio think?"</p>

<p>"I should have to invent a term
to express my notion," said Labio.
"I think all things are but emanations
from, and return to, the same
being. What might be called <i>pantheism</i>,
if we coined a word from the
language of your country, best explains,
I fancy, the phenomena of
the universe. Every thing is growth
and decay; but as decay furnishes
larger growth, every thing is growth
at last and in the total sum."</p>

<p>"Is this growth of all things under
any general control?" asked Dionysius.</p>

<p>"Each thing," replied Labio, "is
under the control of its own nature,
which evidently it cannot change,
and every inferior thing besides is
under the control of any superior
thing with which it may come into
relations. Thus what is <i>active</i> is superior
as such to what is <i>passive</i>; it
is more excellent and a higher force
to act upon, or sway, or change, or
move, or form, than to be acted upon,
moved, or modified. The mind of
an architect, for instance, is a higher
force than the dead weight of the
inert stones from which he builds a
palace."</p>

<p>"Then you hold that some things
have force, and that there are greater
and smaller forces?" asked Dionysius.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," said Labio.</p>

<p>"Which is more excellent," asked
Dionysius, "a force which can move
itself, or a force which, in order to
exist, must be set in motion by another?"</p>

<p>"This last," said Labio, "is only
the first prolonged; it is but a continuation,
an effect."</p>

<p>"And an effect," pursued the
Greek, "is inferior, as such, to what
controls it; and inferior also in its
very nature to that which requires no
cause?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," returned Labio; "I
am not so dull as to gainsay that."</p>

<p>"Now favor me with your attention,"
returned the Athenian; "I
want you to extricate me from a
dilemma. Either every thing which
possesses force has received its force
from something else; or there is
something which possesses force, and
which never received this force from
any thing else, and which, therefore,
has possessed it from all eternity.
Which of these two alternatives do
you select?"</p>

<p>Labio paused, and by this time the
whole of that strangely mixed society
was listening with the keenest relish
and the most genuine interest to the
conversation.</p>

<p>"I see whither you tend," replied
Labio, "but I do not believe in that
universal ruler and original mind, or
first force, which you think to demonstrate.
All things go in circles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>
serially. Every force which exists
has been derived from some other;
and each in its turn continues the
movement, or communicates the impact."</p>

<p>"Prettily expressed," remarked Velleius
Paterculus.</p>

<p>"I beg Augustus," said the Athenian,
"to mark and remember Labio's
words. Every thing which has
force has received its force from something
else. Do you say <em>every thing</em>,
Labio, without exception?"</p>

<p>"Yes, every thing," said Labio.
"I conceive the chain to be endless."</p>

<p>"But <i>not having</i>, good Labio,"
replied the Athenian, "goes before
<i>receiving</i>. I cannot, and you cannot,
receive that which we have already.
In order to say that we receive any
thing, we must first be without it&mdash;must
we not? The state of not having,
I repeat, precedes the act of receiving.
Does any person deny this?
Does Labio?"</p>

<p>No one here spoke.</p>

<p>"Then," said the Athenian, "in
maintaining that every thing which
possesses force <i>has received</i> that force
from something else, Labio necessarily
maintains that every thing which
possesses force <i>was first without it</i>.
I therefore perceive there must have
been a time when nothing possessed
any force whatever. The very first
thing which possessed any, received
it; but whence? For, at that time,
there was nothing to give it. What
says Labio? Is pantheism silent?"</p>

<p>"I wish to hear more," said Labio;
"I will answer you afterward."</p>

<p>A momentary smile, like a passing
gleam, lit up the faces of those around,
as the Athenian, looking toward Domitius
Afer, requested him the next
to favor the company with his opinion
upon the two momentous questions
propounded by Augustus.</p>

<p>"I need not, like Labio, coin a
term from the Greek," said Afer, "to
describe my system. I am a materialist.
I believe nothing save what
my senses attest. They show me
neither God nor soul; and I am determined
never to accept any other
criterion."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure," asked Dionysius,
"that you are thus determined?
I should like to shake such a
determination."</p>

<p>"You'll fail," replied Afer, smiling.
"Which of your senses, then, has
attested to you that very determination?
Can you see, taste, smell, hear,
or touch it? And yet you tell us
you are sure of it. If so, you can
believe in, and be sure of, something
which has never been submitted to
the criterion which alone you admit."</p>

<p>"A determination is not a thing,"
said Afer hastily, and with a little
confusion.</p>

<p>"Was Julius CÃ¦sar a thing?" persisted
Dionysius; "because if you
believe that Julius CÃ¦sar existed, having
heard of him and read of him,
your senses of hearing and seeing do
not attest to you in this case the existence
of Julius CÃ¦sar, but simply the
affirmations of others that he has existed.
My hearing attests to me that
Strabo says he has been in Spain;
and this, if there were no other reason,
would satisfy me that Spain exists;
yet it is Strabo whom I hear.
I do not hear Spain."</p>

<p>Augustus clapped his hands gently,
and laughed. Domitius Afer, with visible
anger, exclaimed,</p>

<p>"I mean, that I will take nothing
but upon proof. Prove that the soul
is immortal; prove that one supreme
God exists. Every thing which a
reasonable man believes ought to be
demonstrated."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Dionysius, "to prove
those two truths to your satisfaction.
But as you say that all we believe
ought to be demonstrated, I will first
offer you a demonstration, that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[742]</a></span>
impossible to demonstrate every thing.
To prove any proposition, you require
a second; and to prove the second,
in its turn, you require a third; and
it is upon this third, if you admit it,
that the demonstration of the first
depends. But if you had fifty propositions,
or any number, in the chain,
what proves <i>the last of them</i>?"</p>

<p>"Another yet," said Afer.</p>

<p>"But," said the Greek, "either you
come to a last, or you never come to
a last. If you never come to a last
proposition, you never finish your
proof; you leave it uncompleted; <i>it
remains still no proof at all</i>; you have
not performed what you undertook.
And if you do come to a final proposition,
which is supported by no other,
what supports it?"</p>

<p>There was a little start of pleasure
in the company at the sudden and
clear closes to which the Athenian
was, each and every time, bringing
what seemed likely to have grown
into intricate and long disquisitions.</p>

<p>"My object, Augustus," pursued
Dion, "was to show that we are all
so made that we feel compelled to
believe much more than we can prove.
Otherwise, our knowledge would be
confined within narrow limits indeed.
He who knows no more than he can
demonstrate, knows but little. May
I now ask the distinguished orators,
Montanus and Capito, for their theories
respecting the questions which interest
us so much to-night?"</p>

<p>Quintus Haterius prevented any
answer to this appeal. "The eloquent
and learned thinker," said he&mdash;"who
will yet, I have no doubt, be
the ornament of the Athenian Areopagus&mdash;has
placed me, and, I think,
many others near me, completely on
his side, in what has hitherto passed.
Young as he is, he has made us feel
the masterful facility with which he
is able to throw light upon errors
placed where truth ought to stand.
The operation is highly amusing; we
could pass a long evening in watching
it repeated against any number
of antagonists. But come, Dionysius,
reverse the process; take your
own ground; maintain it; raise there
your system like your castle; and let
those assail it, if they please, whom
your aggressive genius on the contrary
turns to assail."</p>

<p>"Haterius is right," said Augustus.
"I could assist at any number of
these collisions; but they take a form
which presents your mind to us, my
Athenian, as a hunter and conqueror
rather than a founder."</p>

<p>"But I am no founder," replied
the youth, earnestly and modestly;
"and I aspire to nothing of the kind.
The fact is merely and simply this:
After much study I have arrived at
the conviction&mdash;first, that there is one
absolutely perfect and eternal Being
who governs the universe; and, next,
that what thinks within each of us
never will die. Since you desire to
hear the reasons which have brought
me to these conclusions, I cannot decline
to state one or two of them at
least&mdash;though this place, this occasion,
and this dazzling company befit
the subject far less, I fear, than if a
few studious friends discussed it, sitting
under the starry sky, on some
quiet, unfrequented shore."</p>

<p>"Now we shall hear Plato," said
Tiberius, with something almost like
a sneer.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Dionysius, "Plato
may speak for himself. You have
him to read; why should I repeat
him? Those who miss Plato's meaning
in his own pages would miss it in
my commentary."</p>

<p>Julia uttered a taunting laugh, as
she glanced at her new husband Tiberius,
whom she always treated with
scorn.</p>

<p>"You remember, Augustus," Dionysius
continued, "that a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span>
ago, Antistius Labio, in answering
one of my questions, stated that a
force which could move itself was
more excellent, as such, than one
which required to be set in motion
by another, as the mind of the architect,
said he, is superior to the stones
from which he builds a palace. Labio
then very justly added, in reply
to another question, that what was
moved only by the force of something
else possessed no proper force of its
own, its force being but a continuation
of the first, an effect of the impact.
He finally assented, when I
showed that it is impossible that every
thing without exception which possesses
force should have received it,
because <i>not having</i> goes before receiving,
and because this is only another
mode of saying that every thing without
exception was once devoid of
force. If a particular being has received
the force it possesses, that particular
being must once have been
without it; and if all beings without
exception who possess force have received
it, they likewise without exception
must all, in the same manner,
have first been without it, a supposed
state during which no force at all existed
anywhere. That any being
should ever acquire force, when there
was nowhere any force for it to acquire,
would be an unsatisfactory philosophy."</p>

<p>"There has, perhaps, been," said
Tiberius, "an eternal chain of these
forces transmitting themselves onward."</p>

<p>"If," said the Athenian, "you admit
the existence of any one being
who possesses a force which he never
received from another, that being is
evidently eternal. But to say that a
being has received its force, is to say
that its force has had a beginning;
and to say that any thing begins, is
to say that once it was not. A chain
of forces all received is, therefore, a
chain of forces all begun&mdash;is it not?
Now, if they have all begun, they
have all had something prior to them.
But nothing can be prior to what is
eternal; such a chain or series, therefore,
cannot itself be eternal."</p>

<p>"No link is eternal," said Tiberius;
"but all the links of the chain together
may surely be so."</p>

<p>The Athenian looked round with a
smile at Tiberius, and said, "If all
the forces which exist now, and all
those which ever existed in the universe,
without exception, have been
received from something else, what
is that something else <i>beyond all
the forces of the universe</i>? They
would all without exception have begun.
To say this of them, is merely
to say that they were all non-existent
once; and this without exception. In
other words, the whole chain, even
with all its links taken together, is
short of eternal. If so, it has been
preceded either by blank nothing, or
by some being who has a force <em>not</em>
thus received, a force which is his
own inherently and absolutely, as I
maintain. Tell me of a chain, the
top of which recedes beyond our ken,
that the lowest link depends on
the next to it, and this on the
third, I understand you; but if I ask
what suspends the whole chain, with
all its links taken together, it is no
answer to say that the links are so
numerous and the chain is so long
that it requires nothing but itself to
keep it in suspension. The longer it
is, the greater must be the necessity
of the ultimate grasp, and the stronger
must that grasp be; and observe, it
must be truly ultimate, otherwise you
have not solved the difficulty; nay,
the suspending force must be distinct
from and beyond the chain itself, or
you do not account for the suspension.
But I will put all this past a
cavil. What I said respecting proofs
to Domitius Afer, I say respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[744]</a></span>
causes to Tiberius CÃ¦sar. No one
denies that various forces are operating
in the universe. Now, of two
things, one: Either there is a first
force, acting and moving by its own
freedom, which; being antecedent to
all other forces, not only must be independent
of them all, but can alone
have produced them all; or else there
is in the universe no force which has
not some other antecedent to it. This
last proposition is easily shown to be
an absurdity; <i>for to say that every
force has a force antecedent to it, is the
same as to say that all forces have another
force antecedent to them; in other
words, that, over and above all things
of a given class, there is another thing
of that class</i>. Can there be more than
the whole? Can there be another
thing of a certain kind, beyond all
things of that kind? Besides every
force, is there yet another force? If
any one is here who would say so, I
wait to hear him."</p>

<p>No one said a word.</p>

<p>"Then remark the conclusion,"
pursued Dionysius. "It is a self-contradiction
to contend that there can
be one thing more of a class than all
things of that class; therefore there
is not, and cannot be, a force antecedent
to every force in the universe;
therefore there is, and must be, in the
universe, a force which is the first force,
a force which has not and could not
have any other antecedent to it. Now
this force, being the first, could be
controlled by no other; by its action
every other must have been produced,
and under its control every other must
lie."</p>

<p>"Do not you contradict yourself?"
inquired Afer; "you show there cannot
be a force antecedent to all forces,
and still you conclude that there is."</p>

<p>"There cannot," said Dionysius,
"be a force antecedent to all forces,
because this would be one more of a
class beyond all of a class. But there
may be the first of the class, before
which no other was; and this is what
I have demonstrated to exist. That
first force is antecedent, not to <i>all</i>,
but to all <i>others</i>; there you stop;
there is none antecedent to <em>Him</em>. As
he is the first force, all things must
have come from him. He made and
built this universe; it is his imperial
palace. You have asked me to prove
that one eternal and omnipotent God
lives. I have now given you an argument
which I am by no means
afraid, in this, or any other assembly,
to call a demonstration. And it is but
one out of a great many."</p>

<p>A low murmur of spontaneous
plaudits and frank assent ran round
that luxurious, but highly cultivated,
appreciative, and brilliant company;
and one voice a little too loud was
heard exclaiming,</p>

<p>"It is as clear as the light of day,
dear Dion!"</p>

<p>All eyes turned in one direction,
and Paulus, whose feelings of admiration
and sympathy had thus betrayed
him, blushed scarlet as he withdrew
behind the stately form of Germanicus,
who looked round at him smiling,
half in amusement, half in kindness.</p>

<p>"I do think it a demonstration indeed,"
said Augustus, musing gravely.</p>

<p>"How strangely must that stupendous
Being," said Strabo, the geographer,
"deem of a world which has
come so completely to forget and
ignore him!"</p>

<p>"Your reasoning," resumed Augustus,
"differs much, as you said it would,
from Plato's. Plato is too subtle for
our Roman taste."</p>

<p>"So is he," said Dionysius, "too
subtle, and, I think, too hesitating,
for the taste of most men everywhere.
I admire his genius, but I disclaim
many of his theories, and am not a
disciple of his school."</p>

<p>"Of what school are you?"</p>

<p>"I am dissatisfied with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[745]</a></span>
school," replied the future convert of
St. Paul, blushing. "But I am quite
certain that there is only one God,
and that he is eternal and all-perfect.</p>

<p>"What I have said, I have said because
I believe it; not in order to
play at mental swords with these eloquent
and gifted men, whom I honor.
There is, if we would look for it, a
reflection of this great Being in our
minds like that of a star in water; but
the water must be undisturbed, or the
light wavers and is broken. We see
many beings, greater and smaller.
Now, who can doubt that, where there
are greater and smaller, there must
be a greatest? Each one of us is
conscious and certain of three things:
first, that he himself has not existed
from all eternity; secondly, each of
us feels that he did not make his own
mind; and thirdly, that he could not
make another mind. Now, the mind
who made ours must be superior to
any thing contained in what he thus
made; therefore, although we can
conceive a being of whose power,
knowledge, and perfection we discern
no possible limit, this very conception
must be inferior to its object.
There must exist outside of our mind
some being greater still than the
greatest of which we can form any
intellectual idea, however boundless.
The lead fused in a mould cannot be
greater in its outlines than the mould
which presents the form. Again, no
person will contend that the sublime
and the absurd are one and the same
thing&mdash;that the terms are convertible.
But yet, if an absolutely perfect and
sovereign being did not exist, the conception
which we form of such a being,
instead of constituting the highest
heaven of sublimity to which our
thoughts can soar, would constitute
the lowest depth of absurdity into
which they could sink."</p>

<p>A little pause followed.</p>

<p>"Do you, then," said Afer, with a
subtle smile, "introduce to us the
novel doctrine, that whatever is sublime
must therefore be true?"</p>

<p>"If I said yes," replied Dionysius,
"and I am not a little tempted, you
would succeed in drawing me aside
into a very long and darkling road.
But I have advanced nothing to that
effect. My inference depended not
on assuming that every thing which
is sublime must be true, but on the
supposition that nothing which is
absurd could be sublime."</p>

<p>"Quite so," remarked Haterius;
"and was there not another inference
dormant in what you said?"</p>

<p>"There was," said Dionysius; "but
it looks like subtilizing to wake it and
give it wings; and, as I am a Greek,
I fear&mdash;I&mdash;in short, I have tried to
confine myself to the plainest and
broadest reasonings."</p>

<p>"Fear not," said Germanicus;
"learned Greece, you know, has conquered
her fierce vanquishers."</p>

<p>Tiberius gnawed his under-lip;
and the Lady Plancina, glancing at
him and then at her husband Cneius
Piso, who was listening attentive but
ill at ease, exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Enervated them, you mean!"</p>

<p>Germanicus threw back his head,
smiled, and remarked, "To-morrow
the legions are going forth to try
against the Germans whether the Roman
heart beats as of old; what was
the further inference, Athenian?"</p>

<p>"Since there must," said Dion,
"where greater and smaller beings
exist, be a greatest, we can all try to
form some conception of him. Now,
this conception must fall short of his
real greatness. Why? Because as I
have demonstrated that this being is
the first force, from which all others
in the universe, including our minds,
must have come, no idea contained
in our minds can be greater than the
very power which made those minds
themselves. But, apart from this demonstration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[746]</a></span>
every one of us can say,
a being may exist so great as to be
incapable of non-existence. Such a
being is conceivable; it is his non-existence
which then, by the very supposition,
is inconceivable. Now, if
there be something the non-existence
of which would be inconceivable,
while of the being himself you possess
a notion, thinking of him as, for example,
and terming him, the first force,
eternal, boundless&mdash;giver of all, recipient
of naught&mdash;the certainty of
his existence is established already
<i>for the heart</i>; for that faculty which
precedes demonstration in accepting
truth&mdash;for remember I have shown,
and I have proved, that we are so
made as to be compelled to believe
far more than any of us can ever demonstrate."</p>

<p>"This, then," said Augustus, "is the
dim image of which you spoke; the
reflection of the star in water?"</p>

<p>"Yes, emperor," replied Dionysius;
"but not always dim; the deepest and
the purest of all the lights which that
water reflects. Often it reflects no
image, however; and often it reflects
but clouds and storms. To say you
truly conceive a thing, is to say you
are certain of it <i>in the way you conceive
it</i>. If you conceive any thing to
be certain, you possess the certainty
of it. You may be certain that a
thing is <em>un</em>certain; in other words,
you have arrived at a clear notion of
its uncertainty. To conceive the
contingency of an object, is to possess
the positive idea that it is contingent.
To conceive a necessary being, is to
have the clear idea not simply that
he is, <i>but that he must be</i>. He
could not be conceived at all, he
could not even be an object of
thought, as both necessary and non-existent.
All conceivable objects, except
one, are conceived as either
possible or actual. But that one alone
is conceived as necessary, and, therefore,
<i>necessarily actual</i>. Either a necessary
being is not conceivable&mdash;and
which of us, I should like to
know, cannot sit down and indulge
in the conception?&mdash;or, if he be so
much as conceivable, then his reign
is recognized, because far more than
his existence is involved&mdash;I mean
the impossibility of his non-existence."</p>

<p>"Are all the dreams," said Domitius
Afer, "of a poet's imagination truths
because they are conceptions?"</p>

<p>A few moments of silence followed,
and Paulus Ãmilius looked at his
friend with an expression of terror
which he had not exhibited in his
own contest with the Sejan horse.</p>

<p>"When the poet," replied Dionysius,
"imagines what might have been,
he believes it might have been, and
asks you to believe no more; but he
would be shocked if you believed
less; would be shocked if you told
him he was depicting not that which
had not been, for this he cheerfully
professes, but that which <i>could not ever
be supposed</i>. What I say here," added
the Athenian, "belongs to a different
and somewhat higher plane of thought.
The impossibility to suppose non-existent
an infinitely perfect being, who,
on the other hand, is himself found
not impossible to suppose, ought to
bring home <i>to the heart</i> the fact that
he lives. To be able, in the first place,
to conceive him existing, and straightway
thereafter to feel an utter inability
to form even the conception of his
non-existence, because it is only as
the necessary being and first force
that we can think of him at all, are a
handwriting upon the porch of every
human soul. He lives, I say it rejoicing,
an eternal, necessary, and
personal reality; the very conception
of him would be an impossibility if
his existence were not a fact; yes, and
far more than a fact, a primeval
truth and a primordial necessity."</p>

<p>As the Athenian thus spoke in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[747]</a></span>
clear and firm voice, which seemed
to grow more musical the more it was
raised and exerted, Augustus stood
up and paced to and fro a few steps
on the gravel walk of the impluvium,
with his hands behind him and his
eyes cast down. All who had been
sitting rose at the same time, except
Livia, Julia, Antonia, and the two
Agrippinas.</p>

<p>"This," whispered Tiberius in
Afer's ear, "is not much like failure, or
derision, or disgrace for the Greek."</p>

<p>"My predecessor, Julius CÃ¦sar,"
said Augustus at length, looking
round as he stood still, "was the best
astronomer and mathematician of his
age&mdash;we have his calendar now to
record it; the best engineer of his age&mdash;look
at his bridge over the Rhine;
the best orator, except one, to whom
Rome perhaps ever listened; a most
charming talker and companion on
any subject; a very great and simple
writer; as great a general probably
as ever lived; a consummate politician;
a keen, wary, swift, yet profound
thinker at all times; a man whose intellect
was one vast sphere of light;
and yet I remember well in what
anxiety and curiosity he lived respecting
the power which governs the
universe, and with what minute and
even frivolous precautions he was forever
trying to propitiate a good award
for his various undertakings; how he
muttered charms, whether he was ascending
his chariot or descending, or
mounting his horse or dismounting&mdash;in
short, at every turn. Evidently it
is not the brightest intellects, or the
most perfectly educated, which are
the most disposed to scout and scorn
such ideas as we have just heard from
Dionysius; it is precisely they who
are prepared to ponder them the
most."</p>

<p>"Julius CÃ¦sar," said Tiberius,
"thought, I suspect, pretty much as
a great many others do, that this is a
very dark, difficult subject; and that
we cannot expect to come to any
certain conclusions."</p>

<p>"Not to <em>many</em> conclusions," said
Dionysius; "that much I fully grant.
But two or three broad and general
truths are attainable by means of
reasonings as close, secure, and irresistible
as any in geometry. One
such proof&mdash;and pray do not forget
that I said it was only one out of
many&mdash;making clear the fact that a
single eternal God reigns over all
things, I have laid before Augustus
and this company already. My <em>last</em>
remarks, however, were not disputations,
but were only intended to show
how those conceptions&mdash;to tear which
from the mind would be to tear the
heat from fire and the rays from
light&mdash;tend exactly to that conclusion
which I had <em>first</em> established by a rigorous
demonstration."</p>

<p>"Would not some call your inference
from those conceptions themselves
a demonstration also?" asked
Germanicus.</p>

<p>"I think," replied the Athenian,
"that all would so call it if we had
but time to examine it thoroughly.
There are three other complete lines
of argument, however, each of them
as interesting as a poem; but so abstruse
that I will not travel along
them. I will merely show the gates
which open into these three ascents
of the glorious mountain. It could,
then, be demonstrated, first, that all
things are objects of mind or of knowledge,
<em>somewhere</em>; secondly, that all
things undergo some action, or are
objects of power, <em>somewhere</em>; thirdly,
that all things are loved and cared for
<em>somewhere</em>; and this as forming one
whole work or production that is, in
their relations with each other. Now,
the knowledge, the power, and the
love (or care) in question can belong
only to that first force of whom I
speak; and I distinctly affirm, Augustus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[748]</a></span>
that I believe I should be quite
able, not to prove by probable reasons
merely, but to demonstrate positively
and absolutely, the existence of
one omnipotent God, by three distinct
arguments, starting from the three
points I have here mentioned. Yet
I pass by those golden gates with a
wistful glance at them, and no more."</p>

<p>"It is the <i>horn</i> gates, you know,"
said Labio, smiling, "which open to
the true dreams."</p>

<p>"Ah! poor Virgil!" said Augustus,
first with a smile, and then with a
long, heart-felt sigh. "I wish he
could have heard you, my Athenian."</p>

<p>"The natures of things," said the
Athenian, "and the number of individuals
are known and counted <em>somewhere</em>;
the attraction of physical
things is weighed in a balance somewhere,
and all things are maintained
in their order by <i>limits</i>, and protected
in their relations by a measured mark,
<em>somewhere</em>. But as I have forbidden
myself this vast and difficult field, I
will turn elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Before you turn elsewhere," exclaimed
Antistius Labio, "I would
fain test by a single question the
soundness of the principle from which
you will draw no deductions; you
say all things undergo some action.
Does not this imply the actual presence
of some force in or upon all
things?"</p>

<p>"It is not to be denied," answered
the Athenian.</p>

<p>"What force," asked Labio, "is
actually present in or upon <i>inert matter</i>?"</p>

<p>"The force of cohesion," replied
the Athenian; "and, moreover, the
force of weight, which I take to be
only the same force with wider intervals
ordained for its operation."</p>

<p>A dead pause of an instant or two
followed, and was broken by Herod
Agrippa, who was a person bad indeed
and odious, but of great acuteness
and natural abilities, exclaiming
"The Athenian reminds me of the
<i>number</i>, <i>weight</i>, <i>and measure</i> of our
holy books."</p>

<p>"It is there, indeed, I found them,"
said Dionysius.</p>

<p>"You mentioned," observed Augustus,
after musing a few seconds,
"that the demonstration you gave
us a while ago of a single eternal
God was only one out of many. I
do not want many more, nor several
more; but one more, might gluttony
ask of hospitality? We roam the
halls of a great intellectual fortress
and mental palace to-night, superior
to the palace of the Mamurras."</p>

<p>"Has it such an impluvium, Augustus?"
chuckled the old knight,
caressing his white moustache.</p>

<p>"The impluvium," said Dionysius,
"is that part of the palace where the
light of heaven falls. But the palace,
Augustus, I take to be the sublime
theme; my poor mind is only its
beggarly porter and ostiarius. Suppose,
then, there were only two beings
in all the universe, one more excellent
than the other, which of them
would have preceded the other?"</p>

<p>No one replied.</p>

<p>"If the inferior be the senior," pursued
the Greek, "by so much as the
superior afterward came to excel him,
by so much that superior must have
obtained his perfections from nothing
whatever, from blank nonentity; because
the inferior, by the very supposition,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex hypothesi</i>,) had them not
to bestow."</p>

<p>"The superior being," answered
Augustus, "must therefore be the
elder."</p>

<p>"You speak justly, Augustus," said
the Athenian. "Therefore the less
perfect could never exist, if the more
perfect had not first existed. The
existence, then, of imperfect beings
proves the prior existence of one all-perfect
being, self-dependent, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[749]</a></span>
whom the endowments of the others
must unquestionably have been derived."</p>

<p>"Cannot things grow?" asked
Labio.</p>

<p>"Growth is feeding," answered
Dion; "growth is accretion, assimilation,
condensation in one form of
many scattered elements. Growth is
possible, first, if we have a seed, that
is, an organism capable, when fed, of
filling out proportions defined beforehand;
and, secondly, if we have the
food by which it is sustained. But
who defines the proportions? Who
ordained the form? Who formed
the seed? Who supplies the air, the
light, the food? Would a seed grow
of its own energy if not sown in fostering
earth, or placed in fostering
air and light&mdash;in short, if not fed by
the proper natural juices? Would
it grow if starved of air, earth, light&mdash;thrown
back upon its sole self?
Is not growth necessarily stimulated
<i>from without</i>?"</p>

<p>"Growth is a complicated and
manifold operation," said Augustus,
"implying evidently a whole world
previously set systematically in motion."</p>

<p>"Whence, Labio," asked the Athenian,
"comes your seed that will
grow?"</p>

<p>"From a plant," replied Labio.</p>

<p>"Whence the plant?" pursued the
Greek.</p>

<p>"From a seed."</p>

<p>"Which was first?" asked Dion.</p>

<p>"The plant."</p>

<p>"Then that plant, at least, never
came from a seed," said Dionysius.
"Whence came it?"</p>

<p>"The seed was first," said Labio.</p>

<p>"Then <em>that</em> seed," said Dionysius,
"never came from a plant. Whence
came it?"</p>

<p>There was a laugh, in which not
only Labio, but even Tiberius joined.</p>

<p>"No," said Dionysius; "whatever
the power which traced out beforehand
the limits and proportions which
the seed, by growing or feeding, is to
fill; whatever the power which surrounds
that seed, or other organism,
with the manifold conditions for its
development, that power must be
something more perfect and excellent
than the elements which it thus dispenses
and controls; and the existence
of these less perfect things would
have been impossible, had not the
other existed first. Thus, ascending
the scale of beings, from the less to
the more excellent, the simple fact
that each exists, proves that a being
superior to it must somewhere else be
found, and that the superior was in
existence first; until we reach that
self-existent, all-perfect, eternal being
whose life accounts for a universe
which his power governs, and which
without him would have been an impossibility.</p>

<p>"Without him imperfect things
could never have obtained existence,
and could not keep it for an instant;
and without recognizing him they
cannot be explained. This, Augustus,
is the second demonstration for
which you have asked me. I have
just touched, in passing, the porches
which led to three others. A sixth
could be derived from the nature of
free force. No force is real which is
not free. The force of a ball flung
through the air, is really the force of
something else, not of the ball; a
hand imparted it; that hand was
moved by the mind. In the mind
at last, and there alone, the force becomes
real, because there alone it is
free. All the forces of nature could
be shown to be thus communicated,
or derivative; and the question,
where do they originate? would
ultimately bring us to some mind,
some intelligence. That intelligence
is God."</p>

<p>"Could not all the forces of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[750]</a></span>
universe be blind and mechanical?"
said Afer.</p>

<p>"If so, they would none of them
be free," said the Athenian.</p>

<p>"Well, be it so," said Afer.</p>

<p>"If not free," persisted the Greek,
"they are compulsory; if compulsory,
who compels them? I say, <em>God</em>.
You would have to say, <em>nothing</em>;
which is very like <i>having nothing to
say</i>."</p>

<p>A clamor of merriment followed
this, and Dionysius had to wait until
it subsided.</p>

<p>"I am only showing," he resumed,
"where and how the proof could be
found. A seventh demonstration can
be derived from the moral law. To
deny God, or to misdescribe him,
would necessitate the denial of any
difference between good and evil, between
virtue and vice. It would be
a little long, but very easy to establish
this; far easier than it was to make
intelligible the two proofs which I
have already submitted to you. I
have said enough, however. This
brilliant assemblage perceives that the
belief in one sovereign and omnipotent
mind is not a vain reverie for
which nothing substantial can be advanced;
but a truth demonstrable,
which neither human wit nor human
wisdom can shake from its everlasting
foundations."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Strabo, "whether
this being, of whose knowledge and
power there are no limits, is also mild
and compassionate."</p>

<p>Dionysius was buried in thought
for a short time, and then said,</p>

<p>"Pray favor me with your attention
for a few moments. Love draws nigh
to its object; hatred draws away from
its object, which it never approaches
except in order to destroy it. But
the non-existent cannot be destroyed;
therefore the non-existent never could
draw hatred toward it. Hatred would
say, those things are non-existent
which I should hate, and which I
would destroy if they existed; therefore
let them continue non-existent.
But this sovereign being is antecedent
to all things; in his mind alone could
they have had any existence before
he created them. If, then, he drew
near them, so to speak, approached
them, called them out of nothing into
his own palace, the palace of being,
love alone could have led him. Therefore,
by the most rigorous reasoning,
it is evident that creation is inexplicable
except as an act of love. It is
more an act of love than even preservation
and protection. This omnipotent
being, then, must be love in
perpetual action; love in universal
action, boundless and everlasting love."</p>

<p>"Certainly yours is a grand philosophy,"
said Augustus.</p>

<p>"This sublime being," pursued Dionysius,
"is, and cannot but be, an infinite
mind; he is boundless knowledge,
boundless power, and boundless
goodness. The mere continuance
from day to day of this universe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the Athenian suddenly stopped
and looked round.</p>

<p>"Why, were the most beneficent
human being that ever lived," exclaimed
he, "able by a word to cast
the universe into destruction; were it
in his power to say, at any moment
of wrath or disappointment, that the
sun should not rise on the morrow,
mankind would fall into a chronic
frensy of terror."</p>

<p>"If," cried a shrill voice&mdash;that of
the child Caligula&mdash;"if the sun shines
and one cannot see, it is no use! I
know what I would do with the sun
to-morrow morning, unless I recover
the use of my eyes."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Dionysius.</p>

<p>"I'd blow it out!" cried the dear
boy, tearing off his bandage, stamping
his feet, and turning toward his
interrogator a face neither beautiful
in feature nor mild in expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[751]</a></span></p>

<p>"The sun is in good keeping," said
the Athenian.</p>

<p>Augustus turned, after a short, brooding
look at Caligula, to Haterius, and
said,</p>

<p>"What think you, my Quintus?
Has our Athenian made good his
theories?"</p>

<p>"He has presented them like rocks
of adamant," responded Haterius.
"Dionysius has convinced me perfectly
that the universe has been produced
and is governed by the great
being of whom he has so earnestly
and so luminously spoken."</p>

<p>"Yet one word with you, young
philosopher," said Antistius Labio,
sending a glance all round the circle,
and finally contemplating intently the
broad, candid brow and kindly blue
eyes of the Athenian; "one word!
You remarked that you could prove
all things to be cared for and loved
somewhere. You afterward mentioned
that the care or love in question
could be exercised by none save the
stupendous king-spirit whose existence,
I confess, you almost persuade
me to believe. But now solve me a
difficulty. You have alluded to the
moral law. You maintain, although
this has not been a subject of our debate
to-night, the immortality of our
souls. Finally&mdash;none can forget it&mdash;you
hinted that there could be no
morality, no difference between right
and wrong, virtue and vice, were there
not one sovereign God. Does this
mean, or does it not, that morality is
that which pleases his eternal and
therefore unchanging views?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Dionysius, "I perceive
your drift. You land me amid real
enigmas. But go on; I answer honestly&mdash;<em>Yes</em>."</p>

<p>"Then," pursued Labio, "if the
ghost within us be immortal, it will
be happy after death, provided it shall
have pleased this being, and miserable
should it have offended him."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Now, Augustus," persisted Labio,
"what would you think of the justice
of a monarch who proclaimed
rewards for conforming with his will,
and punishments for thwarting it, but
at the same time would not make it
known what his will was, nor afford
any protection to those who might
be desirous of giving it effect?</p>

<p>"Can Dionysius of Athens or any
body else tell us what are the special
desires of this great being in our regard?
Does he imagine that unlettered,
mechanical, toiling men have
either understandings or the leisure
to arrive at the conclusions which his
own splendid intellect has attained?
Then why is there not some authoritative
teacher sent down among men
from heaven?"</p>

<p>Dionysius answered not. Labio
continued,</p>

<p>"I speak roughly and plainly. I
transfix him with his own principles.
He is too honest not to feel the force
of what I say. He cannot reply.
Mark next: we live but a short while
in this world; and if we be immortal,
our state here is downright contemptible
in importance compared with
that which has to come; and yet he
tells us that this contemptible point
of time, this mere dot of existence, is
to determine our lot for everlasting
ages, and he that says this proclaims
the being whose existence he certainly
has demonstrated to be the
very principle of love itself. Yet this
being who will establish our destinies
according as we please him, tells us
not how to do it."</p>

<p>Again the Athenian refrained from
breaking the expectant silence which
ensued.</p>

<p>"Would not one imagine," said
Strabo, "that the most particular instructions
would be given to us how
to regulate a conduct upon which so
much depends?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[752]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," observed Labio; "and not
instructions alone, but instructors, to
whom occasional reference would be
always possible."</p>

<p>All eyes turned toward Dionysius.
He blushed, hesitated, and at last
said,</p>

<p>"You only echo thoughts long familiar
to my mind. I cannot answer;
I am not capable of solving
these difficulties. Time is not completed.
I think, like the Sibyls, that
some special light is yet to come
down from heaven."</p>

<p>Here the conversation ended.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward, Dionysius,
who had begged to be excused for
that night from entering upon the second
of the two doctrines which he
had been challenged to sustain, was
walking part of the way with Paulus
toward the Inn of the Hundredth Milestone,
along the fretwork of light
which was shed upon the Appian
Road by the moon and stars through
the leaves of the chestnut-trees.</p>

<p>"I feel confident, Paulus," said he,
"that Augustus will restore your family
estates; and should you accept
the liberal offer of Germanicus CÃ¦sar,
and depart upon this German expedition
to-morrow morning, I will
watch your interests while you are
absent."</p>

<p>"I know it well, generous friend,"
replied the other youth; "and I do
hope my mother will not object to
my going. Only think, I may come
back a military tribune! Only think!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dion, "and enter that
great castle which glitters yonder in
the moonlight as proprietor."</p>

<p>"If so, will you not," said Paulus,
"come and stay with us?"</p>

<p>"That is an engagement," said the
Athenian, "provided some day you
will all pay me a return visit at
Athens."</p>

<p>"We'll exchange the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera hospitalis</i>
on it," exclaimed Paulus.</p>

<p>Thus they parted on the moonlit
road, Dionysius returning to FormiÃ¦,
and Paulus walking onward with long,
rapid strides.</p>

INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>The full and complete history of
the remarkable apparition of Lourdes
is now, for the first time, presented to
the English-speaking Catholic public.
Mr. Lawlor has given an abridgment
of M. Lasserre's narrative, with some
interesting additions from other sources,
in his charming volume, <cite>Pilgrimages
in the Pyrenees and Landes</cite>. A
short sketch of the history of the events
at Lourdes has also been given in the
<cite>Irish Ecclesiastical Record</cite>, of Dublin.
In this country the <i>Ave Maria</i> is now
engaged in republishing Mr. Lawlor's
sketch of the history. We trust our
readers will thank us for placing before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[753]</a></span>
them the full and authentic history
of M. Lasserre, a work which has received
the favorable notice of the most
competent judges, and has been honored
by a brief of felicitation from the
Holy Father. The author, who was
himself one of the subjects of the miraculous
efficacy of the water of the
fountain of Lourdes, has spared no
pains to make his work perfectly satisfactory.
The evidence, which he has
collected and arranged with consummate
care and skill, leaves nothing to
be desired in respect to the proof of
the reality and the supernatural character
of the events related. The charm
of his style, the subtle and powerful
irony which he employs with so much
effect against the sceptics who deny
the possibility of any sort of supernatural
incidents, and the vivacity of his
descriptions, make his work extremely
pleasant and profitable reading. Our
devout Catholic readers will find great
delight in perusing M. Lasserre's narrative;
and others, although they may
receive it with a smile of incredulity,
and perhaps favor us with a few witticisms
in respect to its contents, will
find it to be, as the French sceptics
have found it, a very tough subject
for any thing like serious and reasonable
refutation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor of The Catholic
World.</span></p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The little town of Lourdes is situated
in the department of the Upper
Pyrenees, at the entrance to the seven
vales of Lavedan, and between
the low hills that sink into the plain
of Tarbes and the steeper ranges which
grow into the Grande Montagne. Its
houses, built irregularly on a natural
terrace, are grouped, in almost absolute
disorder, around the base of a
rocky spur, on the summit of which
the formidable castle sits like an eyrie.
Along the base of the cliff, on the side
opposite the town, the Gave dashes
boisterously through groves of alder,
ash, and poplar, and, pausing at numerous
dykes, turns the equally sonorous
machinery of several mills. The
hum of the driving-wheels and the
jar of the rattling stones mingle with
the music of the winds and the splash
of the rushing water.</p>

<p>The Gave is formed by several torrents
from the upper valleys, which
spring from the glaciers, whose spotless
snow covers the barren sides of the
Haute Montagne. The principal tributary
comes from the cascade of
Gavarnie, which falls from one of
those peaks never scaled by man.
Leaving on its right the town, the castle,
and, with one exception, all the
mills of Lourdes, the Gave hastens
toward Pau, which it passes with all
speed, to throw itself into the Adour,
and thence into the sea.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Lourdes,
the country which skirts the Gave is
by turns wild and savage, and fair and
smiling. Blooming meadows, cultivated
fields, woodland, and barren
cliffs are alternately presented to the
gaze. Here are fertile plains and
smiling landscapes, the highway of
Pau, never without its wagons, horsemen,
and pedestrian travellers; yonder,
the giant mountains and their awful
solitudes.</p>

<p>The castle of Lourdes, almost impregnable
before the invention of artillery,
was formerly the key of the Pyrenees.
Tradition says that Charlemagne,
warring with the infidels, was
unable to carry this stronghold.
Scarcely had he determined to raise
the siege, when an eagle seated itself
on the highest tower of the citadel,
and let fall a large fish which it had
caught up from some neighboring
lake. Either because it happened on
the day when the holy church prescribes
abstinence from flesh-meat, or
because the fish was at that time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[754]</a></span>
popular symbol of Christianity, the
infidel commander, Mirat, saw in this
fact a prodigy, and, demanding instruction,
was converted to the true
faith. This conversion was all that
was necessary to bring his castle into
the hands of Christendom. Nevertheless,
the Saracen stipulated, as says
the chronicler, "that in becoming the
knight of Our Lady, the Mother of
God, his lands, both for himself and
his descendants, should be free from
every worldly fief, and should belong
to her alone."</p>

<p>The arms of the town still bear, in
testimony of this extraordinary fact,
the eagle and the fish. Lourdes carries,
on a red field, three golden towers,
pointed with sable, on a silver
rock; the middle tower is higher than
the others, and is surmounted by a
black spread eagle, limbed with gold,
holding in his beak a silver trout.</p>

<p>During the middle ages, the castle
of Lourdes was an object of terror to
the surrounding country. At one
time in the name of the English, at
another in that of the Counts of
Bigorre, it was occupied by robber
chieftains, who cared for little besides
themselves, and who plundered the
inhabitants of the plain for forty or
fifty leagues around. They even had
the audacity, it is said, to seize goods
and men at the very gates of Montpellier,
and then to retreat, like birds
of prey, to their inaccessible abode.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, the castle
of Lourdes became a state-prison. It
was the Bastille of the Pyrenees. The
revolution opened the gates of this
prison to three or four persons, confined
there by the arbitrary command
of despotism, and in return peopled it
with several hundred criminals of quite
another description. A contemporary
writer has copied from the jailer's record
the offences for which the prisoners
had been immured. Besides the
name of each prisoner, the specifications
of the crime are thus formulated:
"Unpatriotic.&mdash;Refusing to give the
kiss of peace to citizen N&mdash;&mdash; before
the altar of our country.&mdash;Busybody.&mdash;Drunkard.&mdash;Indifferent
about the
revolution.&mdash;Hypocritical character, reserved
in his opinions.&mdash;Lying character.&mdash;A
peace-loving miser.&mdash;Indifferent
toward the revolution," etc., etc.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>We may thus see what reason the
revolution had to complain of the arbitrary
conduct of kings, and also how
it changed the frightful despotism of
the monarchy into a reign of peace,
toleration, and perfect liberty.</p>

<p>The empire still retained the fortress
of Lourdes as a state-prison, and
this character it kept until the return
of the Bourbons. After the restoration,
the terrible castle of the middle
ages naturally became a place of less
importance, garrisoned by a company
of infantry.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The tower still remains the key of
the Pyrenees, but in a very different
way from what it was formerly. Lourdes
is at the junction of the roads to
the various watering-places. In going
to BarÃ¨ges, to Saint-Sauveur, to Cauterets,
to BagnÃ¨res-de-Bigorre, or
from Cauterets or Pau to Luchon, in
any case, one must pass through Lourdes.
During the fashionable season,
countless diligences, employed in the
service of the baths, stop at the Hotel
de la Poste. Generally they allow
the travellers sufficient time to dine,
to visit the castle, and to admire the
country, before passing on.</p>

<p>Thus from the constant visits of
bathers and tourists from all parts of
Europe, this little town has been
brought to quite an advanced state
of civilization.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[755]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1858, the earliest date of our
story, the Parisian journals were regularly
received at Lourdes. The <cite>Revue
des Deux-Mondes</cite> counted there
many subscribers. The inns and
cafÃ©s presented their guests with three
numbers of the <cite>SiÃ¨cle</cite>, that of the latest
date and the two preceding ones.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> and clergy divided
their patronage between the <cite>Journal
des DÃ©bats</cite>, the <cite>Presse</cite>, <cite>Moniteur</cite>,
<cite>Univers</cite> and <cite>Union</cite>.</p>

<p>Lourdes had a club, a printing-house,
and a journal. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous prÃ©fet</i>
was at ArgelÃ¨s; but the sorrow
which the inhabitants of Lourdes
showed for the absence of this functionary
was tempered by the joy of
possessing the <cite>Tribunal de premiÃ¨re
instance</cite>, that is, three judges, a president,
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureur impÃ©rial</i>, and a deputy.
Around this brilliant centre
revolved as inferior satellites, a justice
of the peace, a commissary of police,
six constables, and seven gendarmes,
one of whom was invested with
the rank of corporal. Inside of the
town we find a hospital and a prison;
and circumstances sometimes come to
pass, as we shall have occasion to
state, in which independent spirits,
nourished with the sound and humane
doctrines of the <cite>SiÃ¨cle</cite>, think that criminals
should be put into the hospital
and the sick into the jail. But these
gentlemen of such extraordinary reasoning
powers are not in exclusive
possession at the bar of Lourdes and
in the medical profession; men of
great learning and high distinction
are to be met&mdash;remarkable minds and
impartial observers of facts&mdash;such as
are not always to be found in more
important cities.</p>

<p>Mountaineers are generally endowed
with strong and practical good
sense; and the people of this neighborhood,
almost unmixed with foreign
blood, excel in this respect. Scarcely
one place in France could be cited
where the schools are better attended
than at Lourdes. There is hardly a
boy who does not for several years go
to lay-teachers or to the institution of
the "Brothers;" hardly a little girl
who does not complete the course of
instruction at the school of the Sisters
of Nevers. Far better taught than
the mechanics of most of our cities,
the people of Lourdes still preserve
the simplicity of rural life. They
have warm veins and southern heads,
but upright hearts and a perfect morality.
They are honest, religious, and
not over-inclined to novelties.</p>

<p>Certain local institutions, dating
back to forgotten times, contribute
toward maintaining this happy state
of things. The people of these regions,
long before the pretended discoveries
of modern progress, had
learned and practised, under the shadow
of the church, those ideas of
union and prudence which have given
rise to our mutual aid societies.
Such associations have for centuries
existed and worked at Lourdes. They
date from the middle ages; they have
survived the revolution, and philanthropists
would long since have made
them famous, if they had not drawn
their vitality from religion, and if
they were not called to-day, as in
the fifteenth century, "confraternities."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nearly all the people," says M. de LagrÃ¨ze,
"enter these pious and benevolent
associations. The mechanics, whom the title
of brotherhood thus unites, place their labor
under heavenly patronage, and exchange
with one another assistance in work and the
succors of Christian charity. The common
alms-box receives a weekly offering from the
stout and healthy artisan, to return it at
some future day when the charitable hands
can no longer earn wages."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the death of a laborer the association
pays the funeral expenses
and accompanies the body to its resting-place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[756]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"Each confraternity except two, who share
the high altar between them, has a particular
chapel, whose name it takes, and which
it supports by the collection made every Sunday.
The confraternity of Notre Dames des
GrÃ¢ces is made up of farmers, tillers of the
soil; that of Notre Dame de Monsarrat, of
masons; that of Notre Dame du Mont Carmel,
of slaters; that of St. Anne, of carpenters;
that of St. Lucy, of tailors and dress-makers;
that of the Ascension, of quarry-workers;
that of the Blessed Sacrament, of
church-wardens; that of St. James and St.
John, of all who have received either of these
names in holy baptism."</p></blockquote>

<p>The women are likewise divided
Into similar religious associations. One
of them, "the Congregation of Children
of Mary," has a special character.
It is also a society for mutual aid and
encouragement, but in relation to
spiritual things. To enter this congregation,
although it is merely an
association of persons living in the secular
state, and not a religious society,
a young person must give evidence
that she possesses a well-tried steadiness
of character. The young girls
look forward to it for a long time before
they reach the proper age for admission.
The members of the congregation
are bound never to put
themselves in danger by frequenting
worldly festivities where the religious
spirit is lost, nor to adopt eccentric
fashions, but to be exact in attending
the meetings and instructions on Sunday.
It is an honor to belong to this
association, a disgrace to be excluded
from it. And the amount of good
which it has done in maintaining public
morality and preparing good mothers
of families, is truly incalculable.
In many dioceses, confraternities have
been founded on the same plan and
after this model.</p>

<p>This part of the country has ever
shown great devotion to the Blessed
Virgin. Her sanctuaries are numerous
throughout the Pyrenees from
PiÃ©tat or Garaison to BÃ©tharram.
All the altars of the church of Lourdes
have been dedicated under the invocation
of the Mother of God.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Such was Lourdes ten years ago.</p>

<p>The railway did not pass through
it; indeed, no one then dreamed that
it ever would. A much more direct
route seemed to be marked out in
advance for the line through the
Pyrenees.</p>

<p>The entire town and fortress are
situated, as we have said, on the right
bank of the Gave, which, prevented
from going north by the rocky foundation
of the castle, turns at a right
angle to the west. An old bridge,
built at some distance above the first
houses communicates with the plains,
meadows, forests, and mountains of
the left bank.</p>

<p>On this side of the stream, below
the bridge, and nearly opposite the
castle, an aqueduct conducts much of
the water of the Gave into a large canal.
The latter rejoins the main
stream at the distance of one kilometre
below, after having passed along
the base of the cliffs of Massabielle.
The long island thus formed by the
Gave and by the canal is a large and
fertile meadow. In the neighborhood
it is called l'Ile du ChÃ¢let, or more
briefly, le ChÃ¢let. The mill of SÃ¢vy
is the only one on the left bank, and
is built across the canal, thus serving
as a bridge. This mill and le ChÃ¢let
belong to a citizen of Lourdes, M. de
Laffite. In 1858, as wild a place as
could be found in the neighborhood
of the thriving little town, which we
have described, was at the foot of
these cliffs of Massabielle, where the
mill-race rejoins the Gave. A few paces
from the junction, on the banks of
the river, the steep rock is pierced at
its base by three irregular excavations,
fantastically arranged, and communicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">[757]</a></span>
like the pores of a huge
sponge. The singularity of these excavations
renders them difficult to be
described. The first and largest is on
a level with the ground. It resembles
a trader's booth, or a kiln roughly
built, and cut vertically in two, thus
forming a half dome. The entrance,
formed into a distorted arch, is about
four metres in height. The breadth
of the grotto, a little less than its
depth, is from twelve to fifteen metres.
From this entrance the rocky
roof lowers and narrows on the right
and left.</p>

<p>Above and to the right of the spectator,
are found two openings in the
rock, which seem like adjoining caves.
Seen from without, the principal one
of these openings has an oval form,
and is about the size of an ordinary
house window or niche in a church
wall. It pierces the rock above, and
at a depth of two metres divides, descending
on one side to the interior
of the grotto and ascending on the
other toward the outside of the rock,
where its orifice forms the second
cave of which we have spoken, which
is of use to let in light upon the others.
An eglantine growing from a
cleft in the rock extends its long
branches around the base of this orifice,
in the form of a niche. At the
foot of this system of caves, so easy
to comprehend to one who looks
upon it, but complicated enough for
one who tries to give merely a word-sketch,
the water of the canal rushes
over a chaos of enormous stones to
meet the Gave, a few steps farther on.
The grotto, then, is close by the lower
point of the Ile du ChÃ¢let, formed,
as we have said, by the Gave and the
canal. The caverns are called the
Grotte de Massabielle, from the cliffs
in which they are situated. "Massabielle"
signifies in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</i> of the
place, "old cliffs." On the river
banks, below, a steep and uncultivated
slope, belonging to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commune</i>,
extends for some distance. Here
the swineherds of Lourdes frequently
bring their animals to feed. When
a storm arises, these poor people
shelter themselves in the grotto, as do
likewise a few fishermen who cast
their lines in the Gave. Like other
caves of this kind, the rock is dry in
ordinary weather, and slightly damp
in times of rain. But this dampness
and dripping of the rainy season can
be noticed only on the right side of
the entrance. This is the side on
which the storms always beat, driven
by the west wind; and the phenomena
here take place which can be noticed
on the honey-combed walls of
stone houses, similarly exposed, and
built with bad mortar. The left side
and floor, however, are always as dry
as the walls of a parlor. The accidental
dampness of the west side even
sets off the dryness of the other parts
of the grotto.</p>

<p>Above this triple cavern the cliffs
of Massabielle rise almost into peaks,
draped with masses of ivy and boxwood,
and folds of heather and moss.
Tangled briers, hazel shoots, eglantines,
and a few trees, whose branches
the winds often break, have struck
root in clefts of the rock, wherever
the crumbling mountain has produced
or the wings of the storm have
borne a few handfuls of soil. The
eternal Sower, whose invisible hand
fills with stars and planets the immensity
of space, who has drawn from
nothing the ground which we tread,
and its plants and animals, the Creator
of the millions of men who people
the earth, and the myriads of angels
who dwell in heaven, this God,
whose wealth and power know no
bounds, takes care that no atom shall
be lost in the vast regions of his handiwork.
He leaves barren no spot
which is capable of producing any
thing. Throughout the extent of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[758]</a></span>
globe, countless germs float in the air,
covering the earth with verdure, where
there seemed before no chance of life
for even a single herb, or tuft of moss.
Thus, O Divine Sower! thy graces,
like invisible but fruitful motes, float
about and rest upon our souls. And,
if we are barren, it is because we present
hearts harder and more arid than
the rocky and the beaten highway, or
covered with tangled thorns that prevent
the up-growing of thy heavenly
seed.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>It was requisite to the ensuing narrative
to describe first the scene where
its events took place. But it is of no
less importance to point out in advance
that profound moral truth, which is
the starting-point from which this history
begins, in the course of which,
as we shall see, God manifested his
power in a visible manner. These reflections
will, moreover, delay only
for an instant the commencement of
our narrative.</p>

<p>Every one has noticed the striking
contrasts presented by the various conditions
of men who live on this earth,
where wicked and good, rich and
needy, are mingled together, and
where a thin wall often separates the
hovel from the palace. On one side
are all the pleasures of life, softly arranged
in the midst of rare delicacies,
comfort, and the elegance of luxury;
on the other, the horrors of want, cold,
hunger, sickness, and all the sad train
of human woes. For the former, adulation,
joyous visits, charming friendships.
For the latter, indifference,
loneliness, and neglect. Whether it
fears the importunity of his spoken or
his mute appeals, or shrinks from the
rebuke of his wretched nakedness, the
world avoids the poor man, and makes
its arrangements without regard to
him. The rich form an exclusive circle,
which they call "good society," and
they regard as unworthy of serious attention
the existence of those secondary
but "indispensable" beings.
When they hire the services of one of
the latter&mdash;even when they are good
people and accustomed to succor the
needy&mdash;it is always in a patronizing
way. They never use, in this case,
the language and tone which they
apply to one of their own kind. Except
a few rare Christians, no one
treats the poor man as an equal
and a brother. Except the saint&mdash;alas!
too rare in these days&mdash;who
follows out the idea of looking upon
the wretched as representing Christ!
In the world, properly so called, the
vast world, the poor are absolutely
forsaken. Weighed down beneath the
burden of toil and care, despised and
abandoned, does it not seem as if they
were cursed by their Maker? And,
yet, it is just the contrary; they are
the best beloved of the Father. While
the world has been pronounced accursed
by the infallible word of Christ,
on the other hand, the poor, the suffering,
the humble, are God's "good
society." "Ye are my friends," he
has said to them in his Gospel. He
has done more; he has identified himself
with them. "What you have
done to the least of these, you have
done also to me."</p>

<p>Moreover, when the Son of God
came upon the earth, he chose to be
born, and to live and die, among the
poor, and to be a poor man. From
the poor he selected his apostles and
his principal disciples, the first-born
of his church. And, in the long history
of that same church, it is upon the
poor that he lavishes his greatest spiritual
favors. In every age, and
with few exceptions, apparitions, visions,
and particular revelations have
been the privilege of those whom the
world disdains. When, in his wisdom,
God sees fit to manifest himself sensibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[759]</a></span>
to men, by these mysterious phenomena,
he descends into the dwellings
of his servants and particular
friends. And mark why he prefers the
houses of the poor and humble. Two
thousand years have only served to
verify that saying of the apostle, "The
weak things of the world hath God
chosen, that he may confound the
strong." (1 Cor. i. 27.)</p>

<p>The facts which we are about to
state will perhaps furnish further
proof of this truth.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>In 1858, the eleventh of February
opened the week of profane rejoicing
which from time immemorial has preceded
the austerities of Lent. It was
the <i>Jeudi-Gras</i>, or Thursday before
Quinquagesima. The weather was
cold and slightly overcast, but very
calm. The clouds hung motionless
in the heavens; there was no breeze
abroad; and the atmosphere was perfectly
still. At times a few drops of
rain fell from the skies. This day is
celebrated by special privilege in the
diocese of Tarbes as the feast of the
illustrious shepherdess of France, St.
Genevieve.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Eleven o'clock in the morning had
already sounded from the church
tower of Lourdes.</p>

<p>While all the neighborhood was
preparing for the festivities, one family
of poor people who lived as tenants
of a miserable dwelling in the Rue
des Petits-FossÃ©s, had not even enough
wood to cook their scanty dinner.
The father, still a young man, was by
trade a miller, and had for some time
endeavored to run a little mill which
he had leased on one of the streamlets
that go to make up the Gave.
But his business exacted advances,
the people being accustomed to have
their wheat ground on credit; and
the poor miller had been forced to give
the mill back to the firm, and his labor,
instead of putting him in better
circumstances, had only helped to
throw him into utter poverty. Waiting
for brighter days, he labored&mdash;not
at his own place, for he had no property,
not even a small garden&mdash;but
at various places belonging to his
neighbors, who employed him occasionally
as a day laborer. His name
was FranÃ§ois Soubirous, and he was
married to a faithful wife, Louise
CastÃ©rot, who was a good Christian,
and kept up his courage by loving
sympathy. They had four children:
two daughters, the elder of whom
was fourteen years of age; and two
boys, still quite young, the smaller
being scarcely four years old.</p>

<p>For fifteen days only, had their
older daughter, a puny child from infancy,
lived with them. This is the little
girl who is to play an important part
in this narrative, and we have carefully
studied all the details and particulars
of her life. At the time of her
birth, her mother, being ill, was unable
to nurse the child, and she was consequently
sent to the neighboring village
of BartrÃ¨s. Here the infant remained
after being weaned. Louise
Soubirous, having become a mother
for the second time, would have been
kept at home by the care of two children
and hindered from going out to
daily service or to the fields, which,
however, would not be the case if her
care were limited to one. Accordingly
the parents left their first-born at BartrÃ¨s.
They paid for her support, sometimes
in money, more often in kind,
five francs a month.</p>

<p>When the little girl grew old enough
to be useful, and the question arose
as to bringing her home, the good
peasants who had reared her found
themselves attached to her, and, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[760]</a></span>
her as one of their own, no
longer charged her parents any thing,
and employed her to tend their sheep.
Thus she grew up in her adopted
family, passing her days in solitude on
the lonely hill-tops, where her humble
flock grazed.</p>

<p>Of prayers she knew none except
the rosary. Whether her foster-mother
had recommended it to her, or
whether it was the dictate of her pure
and innocent heart, she kept up the
hourly practice of reciting this prayer
of the simple. Then she amused herself
with those natural playthings
which kind providence furnishes for
the children of the poor, and with
which they are more content than
their richer cousins with costly toys.
She played with the pebbles, piling up
miniature castles, with the flowers
which she culled on every side, with
the water of the brooklet, where she
launched and followed great fleets of
leaf-boats; besides, she had her pets
among the flock. "Of all my lambs,"
she said, "there is one that I prefer
to all the rest." "And which is it?"
asked somebody. "The one that I
most love is the smallest one." And
she delighted in fondling and caressing
it. She herself was among children
like her own darling in the flock. Although
she was already fourteen years
old, she seemed no more than eleven
or twelve. Without being rendered
infirm, she was subject to asthmatic
affections, which at times caused her
great pain. She bore her ills patiently
and accepted her physical sufferings
with that resignation which seems so
difficult to the rich, but to the needy
so very natural.</p>

<p>In this innocent and silent school
the poor shepherdess learned that
which the world knows not; the simplicity
of soul which pleases the heart
of God. Far from every impure influence,
conversing with the Blessed Virgin
Mary, passing her time in crowning
her with prayers and telling her chaplet,
this little maid preserved that
absolute purity and baptismal innocence
which the breath of the world
so easily tarnishes, even in the best.
Such was this childish soul, bright and
calm as the unknown lakes which lie
hidden among lofty mountains and
silently reflect the splendors of heaven.
"Blessed are the clean of heart," says
the Gospel; "for they shall see God."</p>

<p>These great gifts are concealed treasures,
and the humility which possesses
them is often unconscious of their presence.
The little girl of fourteen years
charmed all who happened to approach
her, and yet she was entirely unaware
of it. She considered herself as the
least and most backward of her age.
Indeed, she did not know how to read
or write. Moreover, she was an entire
stranger to the French tongue, and
knew only her own poor <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</i> of the
Pyrenees. She had never learned the
catechism, and in this respect her
ignorance was extraordinary. The
Our Father, Hail Mary, Apostles'
Creed, and Glory be to the Father,
which make up the chaplet, constituted
the sum of her religious knowledge.
Hence it is unnecessary to add that
she had not yet made her first communion.
It was to prepare her for
this, that the Soubirous determined to
bring her home, in spite of their poverty,
and send her to the catechetical
instructions at Lourdes.</p>

<p>She had now been for two weeks
under her father's roof. Alarmed by
her asthma and her frail appearance,
her mother watched over her with
particular care. While the other
children went barefoot in their sabots,
(wooden shoes,) she was provided
with stockings; and while her sister
and brothers went freely out of doors,
she was constantly employed in the
house. The child, accustomed to the
open air, would very gladly have gone
out into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[761]</a></span></p>

<p>The day, then, was <i>Jeudi-Gras</i>,
eleven o'clock had struck, and these
poor people had no wood to cook
their dinner.</p>

<p>"Go, and gather some sticks by
the Gave or on the common," said
the mother to Marie, her second
daughter.</p>

<p>Here, as in many other places, the
poor have a sort of customary right
to glean the dried branches which
the wind blows from the trees in the
<i>commune</i>, and to the driftwood which
the torrent leaves among the pebbles
on its bank.</p>

<p>Marie put on her sabots. The eldest
child, of whom we have been
speaking, the little shepherdess of
BartrÃ¨s, looked wistfully at her sister.</p>

<p>"Let me go, too?" she finally asked
of her mother. "I will carry my
little bundle of sticks."</p>

<p>"No," replied Louise Soubirous,
"you have a cough, and you will catch
more cold."</p>

<p>A little girl from a neighboring
house, named Jeanne Abadie, about
fifteen years of age, having come in
during this conversation, was likewise
preparing to go for wood. All joined
in importuning, and the mother allowed
herself to be persuaded.</p>

<p>The child at once covered her
head with her kerchief, tied on one
side, as is the custom among peasants
of the south. This did not appear
sufficient to her mother.</p>

<p>"Put on your <i>capulet</i>," said the
latter. The capulet is a graceful garment
worn by the dwellers in the
Pyrenees. It is at once a hood and
a mantle, made of very stout cloth,
sometimes white as fleece, sometimes
of a bright scarlet color; it covers the
head and falls over the shoulders to
the waist. In cold or stormy weather,
the women use it to wrap their
neck and arms, and, when the garment
is too warm, they fold it up in
a square and wear it as a cap upon
their heads. The capulet of the little
shepherdess of BartrÃ¨s was white.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The three children left the town,
and crossing the bridge, reached the
left bank of the Gave. They passed
the mill of M. de Laffite and entered
the ChalÃªt, gathering here and there
sticks for their little fagots. They
walked down the river's course, the
delicate child following at some distance
her stronger companions. Less
fortunate than they, she had not yet
found any thing, and her apron was
empty, while her sister and Jeanne
had begun to load themselves with
twigs and chips.</p>

<p>Clad in a black gown, well worn
and patched, her pale countenance
inclosed in the fold of the capulet
which fell over her shoulders, and her
feet protected by a large pair of sabots,
she wore an air of grace and rustic
innocence which appealed more to
the heart than to the senses. She was
still quite small for her age. Although
her childish features had been touched
by the sun, they had not lost
their natural delicacy. Her fine black
hair scarcely appeared from beneath
her kerchief. Her brow, open to the
air, was free from any line or wrinkle.
Under her arching eyebrows, her
eyes of brown, in her softer than blue,
had a deep and tranquil beauty whose
clearness no evil passion had ever
disturbed. Hers was the "single"
eye of which the Gospel speaks. Her
mouth, wonderfully expressive, revealed
the habitual tenderness of her soul
and pity for every kind of suffering.
Her whole appearance, while it pleased,
also possessed that extraordinary
power of attraction exerted by lofty
minds. And what was it that gave
this secret power to a child so poor,
so ignorant, clothed in tatters? It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[762]</a></span>
the greatest and rarest of possessions,
the majesty of innocence.</p>

<p>We have not yet told her name.
She had for her patron a great and
holy doctor of the church, whose genius
was especially sheltered under
the protection of the Mother of God,
the author of the <cite>Memorare</cite>, the illustrious
St. Bernard. Following a
fashion which has its charms, his
great name, given to this humble peasant,
had taken a childish and rustic
form. The little maid bore a title
as gracious and as pretty as herself.
She was called Bernadette.</p>

<p>She followed her sister and companion
through the fields that belong
to the mill, and sought, but vainly,
among the grass and shrubbery for
some bits of wood to warm their family
hearth. So Ruth or Noemi might
have appeared, going to glean in the
harvest-fields of Booz.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Straying in this manner, the three
little girls reached the lower end of the
ChÃ¢let opposite the triple cave, the
grotto of Massabielle, which we have
endeavored to describe. They were
separated from it only by the mill-race,
which bathes the foot of the cliffs, and
whose current is usually very strong.
To-day, however, the mill of SÃ¢vy has
stopped work, and the small quantity
of water which leaks into the aqueduct
makes but a slender stream, very
easy to wade. The fallen branches
of various trees lie thick among the
rocks in this lonely and ordinarily inaccessible
place. Rejoiced at this
discovery, bustling and active as Martha,
Jeanne and Marie took off their
sabots, and in an instant were across
the stream.</p>

<p>"The water is very cold," they
cried as they hastily put on their wooden
shoes.</p>

<p>It was the month of February, and
these mountain torrents, fresh from
the glacial snows, are always icy cold.</p>

<p>Bernadette, less alert or less eager,
tarrying behind, was still on the nearer
side of the stream. It was a more
serious undertaking for her to cross.
She wore stockings, while Jeanne and
Marie had only to take off their sabots,
in order to wade. Even before
the exclamation of her companions,
she feared the cold of the water.</p>

<p>"Throw in a couple of large
stones," she cried, "so that I may
go over without getting wet."</p>

<p>The two little girls, already engaged
in making up a pair of fagots,
did not wish to lose time by turning
from their task.</p>

<p>"Do as we have done," said
Jeanne, "take off your shoes."</p>

<p>Bernadette resigned herself, and,
seated on a large stone, began to do as
she was bid.</p>

<p>It was about noon; the Angelus
was about to sound from all the belfries
of the Pyrenees.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>She was in the act of drawing off
her first stocking, when she heard
near her a shock like a blast of wind,
bursting with irresistible force upon the
fields. She thought it was a sudden
storm, and instinctively looked behind
her. To her great surprise, the poplars
which border the Gave were
perfectly motionless. Not even the
slightest breeze stirred their boughs.</p>

<p>"I must be dreaming," she said,
and, still thinking of the noise, she
could not believe that she had heard
it. She turned again to her stocking.
At this instant the impetuous roar of
this unknown wind was heard again.
Bernadette raised her glance, and uttered,
or would have uttered, a loud
cry, but it died upon her lips. Her
limbs trembled and gave way. Astounded
by what she saw, and as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[763]</a></span>
shrinking from it, she fell upon her
knees.</p>

<p>A vision of surpassing wonder was
before her eyes. The child's story,
the countless inquiries to which she
has since been subjected by thousands
of active and shrewd investigators,
have brought out all the details, and
enabled us to trace each line of the
general appearance of that wonderful
being who met at this moment the
ravished glance of Bernadette.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Above the grotto, before which
Marie and Jeanne, busily employed
and bent toward the ground, were
gathering sticks, in the rude niche
formed by the rock, surrounded by a
heavenly glory, stood a lady of matchless
beauty.</p>

<p>The ineffable radiance which floated
around her did not hurt the eyes, like
the brightness of the sun. On the
contrary, this aureole of soft and gentle
light irresistibly attracted the
glance, which it seemed to relieve and
fill with pleasure. It was like the
gleam of the morning-star. But there
was nothing vague or misty about the
apparition. It had not the shifting
contour of a fantastic vision; it was a
reality, a human body, which to the
eye seemed palpable as our own flesh,
and which resembled the figure of an
ordinary human person in all respects,
except that it was surrounded by a
luminous halo, and was radiant with
celestial beauty. The lady was of
medium height. She looked very
youthful, like one who had attained
her twentieth year, without losing any
of the tender delicacy of girlhood,
which usually fades so soon. This
beauty bore in her countenance
the impress of everlasting durability.
Moreover, in her features the heavenly
lines blended, without disturbing their
mutual harmony, the peculiar charms
of the four seasons of human life.
The innocent candor of the child, the
spotless purity of the virgin, the calm
tenderness of the loftiest maternity, a
wisdom surpassing the lore of centuries,
blended together without effacing
each other, in this wonderful and
youthful countenance. To whom
shall we liken her in this sinful world,
where the rays of beauty are scattered,
broken, or discolored, and seldom
reach us without some impure mixture?
Every image, every comparison
would only abase this unspeakable
type. No majesty, no excellence,
no simplicity here below could ever
give us an idea whereby we might
better understand it. It is not with
the lamps of earth that we can light up
the stars of heaven.</p>

<p>The regularity and ideal beauty of
these features surpassed all description.
It could only be said that their oval
curve was of infinite grace, that the
eyes were blue and of a tenderness
that sank through the heart of the beholder
to its very depths. The lips
wore an expression of heavenly goodness
and mildness. The brow was
like the seat of the highest wisdom;
that wisdom which combines universal
knowledge with boundless virtue.</p>

<p>Her garments were of an unknown
fabric, woven in the mysterious looms
which serve to robe the lily of the
valley; for they were white as the
stainless mountain snows, and yet
more splendid than the raiment of
Solomon in all his glory. The vesture,
long and trailing in chaste folds,
revealed her virginal feet, which lightly
pressed the broad branch of eglantine,
and on each of which blossomed
the golden mystical rose.</p>

<p>From her waist a sky-blue cincture,
loosely tied, hung, in long bands, to
the instep of her foot. Behind, and
enveloping in its fulness her arms and
shoulders, a white veil descended from
her head to the hem of her robes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[764]</a></span>
No ring, no necklace, no diadem or
gem; none of those ornaments were
there that human vanity loves to parade.
A chaplet, whose drops of
milky white slid on a golden cord,
hung from her hands, fervently clasped
together. The beads glided through
her fingers. Yet the lips of this
Queen of Virgins remained motionless.
Instead of reciting the rosary,
she was, perhaps, listening to the eternal
echo in her own heart of that first
Ave! and the deep murmur of invocation
ever rising from this earth of
ours. Each bead was undoubtedly a
shower of heavenly graces that fell
upon souls like the liquid diamonds
into the chalice of the flower.</p>

<p>She kept silence; but later, her own
words and the miraculous facts which
we shall have to record, were to attest
that she was truly the Immaculate
Virgin, the sinless and stainless among
women, Mary, the Mother of God.</p>

<p>This wonderful apparition looked
upon Bernadette, who, as we have
seen, shrinking and speechless, had
fallen upon her knees.</p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>The child, in her first movement of
fear, had instinctively seized her rosary;
and, holding it in her hands, endeavored
to make the sign of the
cross. But she trembled so violently
as to render this impossible. "Fear
not," said Jesus to his disciples, when
he came walking on the waves of the
sea of Tiberias. The look and smile
of the Blessed Virgin appeared to say
the same thing to this frightened little
shepherdess.</p>

<p>With a sweet, grave gesture, which
seemed like a benediction to earth
and heaven, she, as if to encourage
the child, made the sign of the cross.
And the hand of Bernadette, raised,
as it were, by her hand who is called
the Help of Christians, repeated the
sacred sign.</p>

<p>"Fear not, it is I," Jesus said to his
disciples.</p>

<p>The child felt no more fear. Astonished,
charmed, scarcely trusting
her senses, and wiping her eyes, whose
glance was riveted by the heavenly
vision, no longer knowing what to
think, she humbly recited her rosary:
"I believe in God"&mdash;"Hail, Mary!
full of grace!"</p>

<p>When she had finished saying the
last "Glory be to the Father, and to
the Son, and to the Holy Ghost," the
bright Virgin suddenly disappeared,
reÃ«ntering that eternal paradise, the
dwelling of the Holy Trinity, whence
she had come.</p>

<p>Bernadette felt like one who has
suddenly fallen from a great height.
She stared vacantly around. The
Gave still flowed on, moaning over
the pebbles and broken rocks; but the
noise seemed to her more sorrowful
than before; the waters themselves
seemed more gloomy, the landscape
and sunlight less bright than formerly.
In front the cliffs of Massabielle
extended, and beneath them her companions
were still engaged in collecting
the sticks of wood. Above the grotto
were still the niche and the arch of
eglantine; but nothing unusual appeared
there; no trace remained of
the celestial visitor. They were no
longer the gate of heaven.</p>

<p>The scene which we have just related
must have lasted for a quarter
of an hour; not that Bernadette was
conscious of the lapse of time; but it
may be measured by the circumstance
that she had been able to recite five
decades of the rosary.</p>

<p>Completely restored to herself, Bernadette
finished removing her shoes
and stockings, and rejoined her companions.
Absorbed by what she had
seen, she did not dread the cold of
the water. All her childish powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[765]</a></span>
were concentrated in recalling the
facts of this strange apparition.</p>

<p>Jeanne and Marie had seen her fall
upon her knees and betake herself to
prayer; but as this, thank God, is not
a rare occurrence with these mountaineers,
and as they were occupied at
their task, they had paid no further
attention.</p>

<p>Bernadette was surprised at the
perfect calmness which her sister and
Jeanne evinced. They had just finished
their work and, entering the
grotto, began to play as if nothing
extraordinary had happened.</p>

<p>"Have you seen nothing?" asked
the child.</p>

<p>They then noticed that she seemed
disturbed and agitated. "No," they
replied; "have you seen any thing?"</p>

<p>Was it that Bernadette feared to
tell what filled her soul, for fear of
profanation? Did she wish to enjoy
it in silence? Or was she restrained
by a bashful timidity? Nevertheless,
she did obey that instinct which
prompts humble souls to conceal as a
treasure the special graces with which
God favors them.</p>

<p>"If you have seen nothing," said
she, "I have nothing to tell you."</p>

<p>The little fagots were bound up.
The three children began to retrace
the road to Lourdes. But Bernadette
could not conceal her trouble. On
the way, Marie and Jeanne teased
her, to find out what she had seen.</p>

<p>The little shepherdess yielded to
their entreaties and their promise of
eternal secrecy.</p>

<p>"I saw," she began, "something
dressed in white." And she went on
to describe her marvellous vision.
"This is what I saw," said she in
conclusion; "but do not, for the world,
say anything about it."</p>

<p>Marie and Jeanne did not doubt a
syllable. The soul in its first innocence
is naturally believing. Doubt
is not the besetting sin of childhood.
And even were they disposed to be
sceptical, the earnest accents of Bernadette,
still agitated and full of what
she had seen, would have irresistibly
led them to believe. Marie and
Jeanne did not doubt, but they were
frightened. The children of the poor
are naturally timid. Nor is it strange,
since sufferings come to them from
every side.</p>

<p>"It is, perhaps, something that will
do us harm," said they. "Let us never
go there again, Bernadette."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the confidants of the
little shepherdess reached the house,
when the secret fairly boiled over.
Marie told it all to her mother.
"What is all this stuff, Bernadette,
that your sister has been telling me?"
The little girl repeated her story.
Marie Soubirous shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You have been deceived, child.
It was nothing at all. You thought
that you saw something, but you did
not. This is all fancy and imagination."</p>

<p>Bernadette still adhered to her
story.</p>

<p>"At any rate," said her mother,
"never go near that place again. I
forbid it."</p>

<p>This prohibition wounded Bernadette
to the heart. For, ever since
the apparition had vanished, she had
felt the greatest desire to see it once
more.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she was resigned, and
said nothing.</p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>Two days, Friday and Saturday,
passed. The extraordinary event was
continually present to the mind of
Bernadette, and became the absorbing
topic of conversation with her
sister Marie, with Jeanne, and a few
other children. Bernadette still bore in
her mind the memory of this heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[766]</a></span>
vision; and a passion&mdash;if one may
use a word so profane to designate
so pure a sentiment in a heart so innocent
and girlish&mdash;a burning desire
to see again this incomparable lady
had taken possession of her soul.
This name of "lady" was the one
which they naturally used in their
rustic language.</p>

<p>Whenever she was asked if this
apparition resembled any one celebrated
in the place for beauty, she
shook her head and said sweetly,
"Not at all. This does not give the
faintest idea of her. She is of a
beauty impossible to express."</p>

<p>She longed to see her once more.
The other children were divided between
fear and curiosity.</p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>On Sunday morning, the sun rose
brightly; the weather was beautiful.
The open winter in the valleys of the
Pyrenees frequently has days which
equal spring.</p>

<p>On returning from mass, Bernadette
begged Marie and Jeanne and
two or three other children to insist
with her mother and persuade her to
take off the prohibition and permit
them to return to the cliffs of Massabielle.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it may be some wicked
thing," said the children.</p>

<p>Bernadette answered that she was
not afraid, for it had such a wonderfully
kind face.</p>

<p>"At all events," replied the children,
who, better taught than the poor
shepherdess of BartrÃ¨s, knew something
of the catechism&mdash;"at all
events, we must throw some holy
water at it. If it comes from the devil,
it will go away. Say to it, 'If
you come from God, approach! If
you come from the devil, be off!'"</p>

<p>This is not the precise formula for
exorcism; but these little theologians
of Lourdes could not have reasoned
better in this matter, if they had been
doctors of the Sorbonne.</p>

<p>It was therefore decided, in this
juvenile council, that one of them
should carry the holy water. A certain
feeling of apprehension had
stolen over Bernadette on account of
this talk. Nevertheless it only remained
to obtain permission.</p>

<p>The children assembled after dinner
to ask for it. The mother was
still unwilling to remove the prohibition,
alleging that the Gave ran close
to the cliffs of Massabielle, and that
there might be danger; that the hour
for vespers was near at hand, and that
they ought not to run the risk of being
late; and that the whole story was
pure childish prattle, etc. But every
body knows what a regiment of children
can do. All promised to be
careful, to be quick, etc., and the matter
ended by the mother's yielding.</p>

<p>The little band went to the church,
and there prayed for some time. One
of Bernadette's companions had provided
a small bottle. It was now
filled with holy water.</p>

<p>On arriving at the grotto, nothing
was to be seen.</p>

<p>"Let us pray," said Bernadette,
"and recite the rosary."</p>

<p>The children knelt and began the
rosary, each to herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly the face of Bernadette
appeared to be transfigured. Extraordinary
emotion was manifested on
her features, and her countenance
seemed to shine with heavenly light.</p>

<p>With feet resting upon the rock,
clad as formerly, the marvellous apparition
again stood before her.</p>

<p>"Look! look!" she cried, "there
it is!"</p>

<p>Alas! the vision of the other children
was not miraculously cleared from
the film which hides glorified bodies
from our sight. The little girls saw
nothing but the lonely rock and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[767]</a></span>
branches of eglantine, which descended
to the foot of that mysterious
niche, where Bernadette contemplated
an unknown being. The features of
Bernadette wore an expression that
made it impossible to doubt that she
really saw something. One of the
children placed the bottle of holy
water in her hands. Then, Bernadette,
remembering what she had
promised, arose and sprinkled the
wonderful lady, who stood in the
niche before her.</p>

<p>"If you come from God, approach!"
said the little girl. And, at
her words, the Blessed Virgin advanced
close to the edge of the rock. She
seemed to smile at the precautions
of Bernadette, and, at the sacred name
of God, her face shone even brighter
than before.</p>

<p>"If you come from God, approach!"
repeated Bernadette. But,
seeing the heavenly goodness and
love of her glorious visitor, she felt
her heart sink when about to add, "If
you come from the devil, go away!"
These words, which had been dictated
to her, seemed monstrous in the presence
of this incomparable being;
and they fled from her thoughts without
mounting to her lips. She prostrated
herself again, and continued to recite
her rosary, to which the Blessed
Virgin seemed to listen, telling also
her own. At the end of her prayer,
the apparition vanished.</p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>Returning to Lourdes, Bernadette
was full of joy. She rehearsed in
the secrecy of her heart these extraordinary
scenes. Her companions felt a
sort of terror in her presence. The
transfiguration of the countenance of
Bernadette had convinced them of
the reality of the supernatural vision.
And every thing that surpasses nature
brings with it a sense of awe. "Let
not the Lord speak to us lest we die,"
said the Jews of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>"We are afraid, Bernadette. Never
go to that place again. Perhaps what
you have seen will do us mischief."
So said the timid companions of the
little seer.</p>

<p>According to their promise, the
children returned in time for vespers.
When they were over, numbers of people
came out to walk and enjoy the last
rays of the sun, so delightful on these
fine winter days. The story of the
little girls was told among various
groups of walkers, and passed from
mouth to mouth. Thus it was that
the rumor of these strange things began
to spread in the town. The report,
which at first had agitated only
a humble band of children, increased
like a tide-wave, and reached every
fireside. Quarry-workers, (very numerous
at this place,) tailors, laboring-men,
peasants, servants, waiting-maids,
and other poor people conversed
about this matter, some believing,
some denying, others openly
scoffing at, and many exaggerating,
the facts of this rumored apparition.
With one or two exceptions, the bourgeoisie
did not pay the least attention
to all this talk. Strange to say, the father
and mother of Bernadette, while
they confided fully in her sincerity,
regarded the apparition as an illusion.</p>

<p>"She is only a child," they said.
"She thinks she has seen something;
but she has seen nothing. It is only
the imagination of a little girl." Nevertheless,
the extraordinary precision
of Bernadette's recital startled them.
At times, won by the earnest accents
of their daughter, they felt their incredulity
shaken. And while they desired
that she should not revisit the
grotto, they did not dare to forbid
her. She did not do so, however,
until Thursday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[768]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>During the first days of the week,
several persons came to see the Soubirous,
in order to question Bernadette.
Her answers were brief and
exact. She might be laboring under a
delusion, but it was only necessary to
see her to know that she was in good
faith. Her perfect simplicity, her innocent
age, her tone of earnestness, all
contributed to give her words a force
which carried conviction. All who
visited her were entirely satisfied of
her veracity, and persuaded that
something extraordinary had happened
at the cliffs of Massabielle.</p>

<p>The statement, nevertheless, of an
ignorant little girl could not suffice to
establish firmly an event so entirely
out of the ordinary course of things.
There must be other proofs besides
the word of a child.</p>

<p>But what was this apparition, supposing
it to have been real? Was
it an angel of light, or a spirit from
the abyss? Was it not some suffering
soul, wandering and seeking
prayers? Might it not have been so-and-so
or so-and-so, who, but recently
dead in the odor of sanctity, had appeared
to manifest the glory of the
life to come? Faith and superstition
each proposed their hypotheses.</p>

<p>Did the mournful ceremonies of
Ash-Wednesday help to incline a certain
lady and a young girl of Lourdes
to one of these solutions? Did
they see in the shining whiteness of
the garments which the apparition
wore, some likeness to a shroud or
some sign of a ghost? We know
not. The young girl was named Antoinette
Peyret, and was a member
of the society of the Children of
Mary; the other was Mme. Millet.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>"It is undoubtedly some soul from
Purgatory, who implores us to have
masses offered up for it." So they
thought; and they went to see Bernadette.</p>

<p>"Ask this lady who she is, and what
she wishes," said they. "Get her to
explain it to you; or, if you cannot
understand, let her put it in writing."</p>

<p>Bernadette, who felt a keen desire
to return to the grotto, obtained from
her parents a new permission; and the
following morning, Thursday, February
the 18th, about six o'clock, at daybreak,
and after having heard mass at
half-past five, she, together with Antoinette
Peyret and Mme. Millet,
turned her steps in the direction of
the grotto.</p>


<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>The repairs in the mill of M. de
Laffite had been completed, and the
canal which moved the machinery
had been opened to the current; so
that it was impossible to reach the
end of their journey by the old way
of the ChÃ¢let. They were obliged to
ascend the side of the EspÃ©lugues,
choosing a steep path which led to
the forest of Lourdes; then to descend
by a break-neck route to the
grotto, over crags, and the steep, loose
soil of Massabielle.</p>

<p>In the face of these unforeseen difficulties,
the two companions of Bernadette
were somewhat dismayed.
But she, on the contrary, even then
trembled with an eager desire to reach
their destination. It seemed as if an
invisible power sustained and endowed
her with unwonted energy. She,
usually so frail and weak, felt at that
moment stout and strong. Her steps
became so rapid as they began the
ascent, that Antoinette and Mme.
Millet, though both were strong and
in perfect health, had a good task to
keep up with her. The asthma, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[769]</a></span>
usually hindered her from running,
seemed to have left her for the time
being. On reaching the summit, she
was neither tired nor out of breath.
Although her companions were perspiring
and panting, her face was perfectly
calm. She descended the cliffs,
which she thus traversed for the first
time, with the same ease and agility,
feeling conscious that an invisible power
guided and sustained her. Over
these steep and sharp declivities,
among slippery stones, hanging over
the abyss, her step was as bold and
firm as if walking upon the highway.
Mme. Millet and Antoinette did not
endeavor to follow at the same gait.
They descended slowly, and with the
precaution required by so perilous a
way.</p>

<p>Consequently, Bernadette arrived
at the grotto some minutes before
them. She prostrated herself and
began reciting her chaplet, earnestly
regarding the niche, still empty and
embowered by the entwining boughs
of the eglantine.</p>

<p>Suddenly she uttered a cry. The
well-known light of the aureole shone
from the depths of the cave; she
heard a voice calling her.</p>

<p>The wonderful apparition was again
visible a few steps above her. The
lovely Virgin turned toward the child
her face lit up with eternal beauty,
and with her hand beckoned her to
approach.</p>

<p>At this moment, after surmounting
a thousand and one difficulties, the two
companions of Bernadette, Antoinette
and Mme. Millet, reached the spot.
They saw the features of the child
transfigured with ecstasy. She heard
and saw them.</p>

<p>"She is there!" the girl cried, "she
beckons me to draw near!"</p>

<p>"Ask if she is annoyed because we
are here with you. If so, we will go
away."</p>

<p>Bernadette looked at the Blessed
Virgin, invisible to all save herself.
Then she turned toward her companions.
"You may remain," she answered.</p>

<p>The two women knelt beside the
child and lighted a blessed taper,
which they had brought with them.
It was, beyond doubt, the first time
that such a light had ever shone in
this savage place. This simple act,
which seemed to inaugurate a sanctuary,
had in itself a mysterious solemnity.</p>

<p>This visible sign of adoration, this
humble flame lighted by two poor women,
on the supposition that the apparition
was divine, was never more to
be extinguished but to brighten daily,
and to grow with the lapse of years.
The breath of incredulity was to exhaust
itself against it in vain efforts.
The storm of persecution was to arise;
but this flame, lit by the devotion of the
people, was to point for ever toward
the throne of God. While these rustic
hands lighted the first illumination
in this strange grotto where a
child was praying, the east had changed
its color from gray to gold and
purple, and the sun had begun to
flood the world with light and to peep
over the highest crest of the mountains.</p>

<p>Bernadette, in ecstasy, contemplated
a cloudless beauty. "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tota pulchra
es, amica mea, et macula non est
in te</i>:" Thou art all beautiful, my beloved,
and there is no spot in thee.</p>

<p>Her companions spoke to her again.</p>

<p>"Go toward her, if she makes a
sign. Go, ask her who she is, and
why she comes here?... Is she
a soul from purgatory that needs our
prayers, or wishes us to have masses
offered up for her?... Ask her
to write on this paper what she desires.
We are willing to do any thing
she wishes&mdash;all that is needful for her
rest."</p>

<p>The little seer took the paper, ink,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[770]</a></span>
and paper, which were given her
and advanced toward the apparition,
whose maternal glance brightened on
seeing her draw near. Nevertheless,
at each step that Bernadette
made, the apparition receded into the
interior of the cave. The child lost
sight of it for a moment, and it went
under the arch of the lower grotto.
There, just above her and much
nearer at hand, she saw the Blessed
Virgin shining in the opening of the
niche.</p>

<p>Bernadette held in her hand the
objects which had been given her;
she stood on tiptoe to reach the
height of the supernatural being.
Her two companions advanced to
hear, if possible, the conversation
which was about to take place. But
Bernadette, without turning, and as
if obeying a gesture of the vision,
signed to them not to approach.
Abashed, they withdrew.</p>

<p>"My Lady," said the child, "if
you have any thing to tell me, will
you not please write what you wish?"</p>

<p>The heavenly Virgin smiled at this
naÃ¯ve request. Her lips parted and
she spoke:</p>

<p>"What I have to tell you I do not
need to write. Only do me the favor
to come here every day for two
weeks."</p>

<p>"I promise to do so!" said Bernadette.</p>

<p>The Blessed Virgin smiled again
and made a gesture of satisfaction,
showing her full confidence in the
word of this poor little peasant of
fourteen years. She knew that the little
shepherdess of BartrÃ¨s was pure as
one of those little ones whose golden
heads Jesus loved to caress, saying,
"Of such is the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>To the promise of Bernadette, she
replied by a solemn engagement:</p>

<p>"And I for my part promise to
make you happy, not in this world,
but in the next."</p>

<p>To the child who accorded her a
few days, she promised, in return,
eternity.</p>

<p>Bernadette, without losing sight of
the apparition, returned to her companions.</p>

<p>Following her glance, she noticed
the eyes of the Blessed Virgin resting
kindly and for some time on Antoinette
Peyret, who was unmarried
and a member of the Confraternity
of the Children of Mary.</p>

<p>Bernadette told them what she
had seen.</p>

<p>"She is looking at you now," said
the child to Antoinette.</p>

<p>The latter was filled with pleasure
by these words and always recalled
them with joy.</p>

<p>"Ask," said they, "if she is willing
to have us accompany you hither
during the fortnight."</p>

<p>Bernadette addressed the apparition.</p>

<p>"They may come with you," answered
the Blessed Virgin, "and also
any other persons. I desire to see
every body here."</p>

<p>Saying these words, she disappeared,
leaving behind her that brilliant light
with which she was surrounded, and
which slowly melted away.</p>

<p>In this instance, as in others, the
child noticed something which seemed
a rule with regard to the aureole
which always surrounded the Blessed
Virgin.</p>

<p>"When the vision appears," said
she, in her own language, "I see first
the light and then the 'Lady;' when
it disappears, the 'Lady' first vanishes
and afterward the light."</p>

<h2>THE "PARADISE LOST" OF ST. AVITUS.</h2>


<p>The indebtedness of Milton to Andreini
for the conception of <cite>Paradise
Lost</cite>, is proved not only by internal
evidence, but by the ascertained fact
that the English poet was well acquainted
with the work of the Italian.
Another poet of merit, centuries
before, had produced a noble
work on the subject, with which we
may suppose, from Milton's classical
and theological learning, he was
familiar, though no proof exists that
he had read it. We refer to the three
poems of St. Avitus, Bishop of Vienne,
<cite>The Creation</cite>, <cite>Original Sin</cite>, and
<cite>The Judgment of God</cite>, which form a
triad, or a poem in three parts. Its
resemblance to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, in general
idea and in some important details,
is very striking, and a curious
fact in literature. These, with other
works of the author, were published
at the beginning of the sixteenth century,
though written long before.</p>

<p>Alcimus Ecdicius Avitus, born about
the middle of the fifth century, was
of a senatorial family in Auvergne.
He became bishop <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 490, dying in
525. His part in the church of Gaul
was active and important, as he was
chief among the orthodox bishops of
the east and south of Gaul, and
Vienne belonged to the Burgundian
Arians. In the struggle to maintain
the true faith against the Arians, St.
Avitus had to contend not only
against theological adversaries, but
the civil power. In the year 499 he
held a conference at Lyons with
some Arian bishops, in the presence
of King Gondebald; and he influenced
King Sigismund to return to
the true belief.</p>

<p>He was the most distinguished
among all the Christian poets from
the sixth to the eighth century, and
only the obscurity of the age can account
for the oblivion into which his
works have fallen. It is true that his
poetry abounds in labored comparisons
and artificial antitheses; but in treating
of sacred subjects he adheres to the
scriptural simplicity, and though living
much nearer to the days of paganism
than Milton, has nothing like his mythological
allusions and ornaments. He
wrote a hundred letters on his own
times, besides homilies and treatises.
His six poems are in hexameter verse.
They are, <cite>The Creation</cite>, (<cite>De Initio
Mundi</cite>,) <cite>Original Sin</cite>, (<cite>De Originali
Peccato</cite>,) <cite>The Judgment of God</cite>, (<cite>De
Sententia Dei</cite>,) <cite>The Deluge</cite>, (<cite>De Diluvio
Mundi</cite>,) <cite>The Passage of the Red
Sea</cite>, (<cite>De Transitu Maris Rubri</cite>,) and
<cite>In Praise of Virginity</cite>, (<cite>De Consolatoria
Laude Castitatis</cite>, etc.) The first
three constitute what may be called
the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> of St. Avitus.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Creation</cite>, the peculiar features
of the descriptive poetry of the
sixth century appear, resembling the
school founded by the AbbÃ© Delille;
elaborate beyond good taste, dissecting
and anatomizing in details. This
is almost painfully shown in the account
of the creation of man, in which
the anatomical particulars are minute
and scientific to the utter destruction
of the picturesque. Then comes the
description of paradise, which is in
curious analogy to Milton's. We
translate part of it:</p>

<p>The Nile, according to religious
traditions, was one of the four rivers
of paradise. In his description of its
fertilizing inundation, St. Avitus paints,
in a poetical figure, the view presented
in after-years:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"When, swollen, the river overflows its banks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strewing the plains with dark slime, fertile then<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Memphis in the midst of a vast lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appears, and o'er their fields submerged in crafts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laborers sail. The flood's decree sweeps forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All boundaries, equalizing all, and stays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The season's labors. Joyful sees the shepherd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His meadows swallowed, and from foreign seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange shoals of fish where erst his herds were fed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when the waters have espoused the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impregnating its gems, the Nile recedes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls back its scattered waters, and the lake,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Its floods encompassed in the ancient dyke."<br /></span>

<p>An analogous phenomenon&mdash;far
more vast and terrible&mdash;the descent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[773]</a></span>
of the waters of the upper firmament,
and the overflow of earthly floods, is
described by St. Avitus in his poem
on <cite>The Deluge</cite>.</p>

<p>In the second part of the triad,
<cite>Original Sin</cite>, the sacred traditions are
implicitly followed; something is to be
found of Andreini's conception of the
prince of hell preserving in the demon
the grandeur of the angel, carrying
into the pit of evil the traces of a
heavenly nature. The Satan of St.
Avitus is not the devil of mere traditions,
odious, hideous, malignant,
with no elevation of feeling. He
retains some traits of his first estate
and a certain moral grandeur. Nevertheless
the conception lacks the sublimity
of Andreini's and Milton's,
presenting none of those fierce conflicts
of the soul, those appalling contrasts,
which are so effective. It has,
however, originality and energy, forcibly
impressing the reader.</p>

<p>Satan, first entering paradise, and
perceiving Adam and Eve, is thus
portrayed:</p>

<span class="iq">"When he beheld the new-created pair<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In peace their sway confessing&mdash;jealous rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like lightning raised a tempest in his soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to volcanic fires his fury burned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too recent his great loss; hurled down from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the infernal pit, and with him fallen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The troop who shared his fate! The agony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shame of such defeat, with added pangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And horror, rose afresh, when he beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those happy ones; and full of bitter grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Envy, despite, he poured his anger forth.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This odious race the offspring of our ruin!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We will not suffer any thing immortal<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here in its source! Oh! that its chiefs defeat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be the seed of death! Life's principle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give rise to pangs of death! all struck in one!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The root cut and the tree for ever prone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such consolation in my fall is mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I must never more ascend to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least its portals shall be closed 'gainst these!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The misery I suffer is less keen<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That the same pride which drove me out of heaven<br /></span>

<p>More elevated, impassioned, and
complex are the feelings of Milton's
Satan, more eloquent his expression;
yet the simple energy, the menacing
concentration of the arch-fiend painted
by St. Avitus, has a powerful effect.</p>

<p>The third book exhibits the despair
of Adam and Eve after the fall; the
coming of the divine Judge; his sentence,
and their expulsion from paradise.
Where Milton represents Adam
as giving way to indignation against
Eve, St. Avitus causes him to rage
against the Creator himself.</p>

better than Milton's ornamentation.</p>

<h2>THE WILLIAN GIRLS</h2>


<p>Some persons have a natural enjoyment
of tribulation. They take a
real pleasure in raising their eyebrows
lugubriously, holding their heads a
little on one side with a sorrowful
and resigned expression, and looking
at the world through blue spectacles.
They "always sigh in thanking God,"
and can find a cloud in the sunniest
sky. You can never conquer such
people on their own ground. If you
have a slight pain in your little finger,
they have an excruciating pain
in their thumb; if you have caught
your robe on a nail, theirs has been
rent on a spike; if you have been
wet in a shower, they have been
soaked in a torrent. These persons
have minor voices, make great use
of chromatics in speaking, and their
affections seem to be situated in the
liver.</p>

<p>Mr. Christopher Willian had a
taint of this "green and yellow melancholy"
in his disposition, and his
rapidly increasing family gave full
scope for its development.</p>

<p>"If Eva were a boy, now," he
sighed, "I could soon have some
one to help me in the shop. But&mdash;nothing
but girls!"</p>

<p>"Eva is a treasure!" Mrs. Willian
answered stoutly. "I wouldn't
exchange her for the best boy in the
world."</p>

<p>"But girls are so expensive," the
father objected, "and they can't earn
any thing; that is, mine can't. I
don't want a daughter of mine to
leave my house till she marries."</p>

<p>"And there is no need of their
doing any thing, my dear," the mother
replied cheerfully. "We own
our house, and your business is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[776]</a></span>
good. Then, when the mortgages
are paid off on your building, the
rent of the upper flats will make us
quite independent. In three or four
years we shall be out of the wood,
all our pinching and toiling over."</p>

<p>Mrs. Willian was a thrifty, clear-headed,
energetic woman; but, though
she would not have owned it, she
herself found the prospect appalling.
As she sat there after her husband
left her, she glanced out the chamber
window and saw Dinah, the one servant
of the house, putting out the
washing, her accusing face looming
darkly over the interminable lines of
wet dry-goods. Oh! the strings to
tie, the buttons to button, the hooks
to hook! And here on her knees
lay another candidate for such services,
an unconscious little affliction
of two weeks old! Oh! the rents
and rips to mend, the darnings and
makings over, the little faces to wash
and locks to comb, the faults to
chide, the teasings to bear, the questions
to answer! She had just got a
glimpse through the door of Eva
with her hair in a snarl, and of Helen
with soiled stockings on; she knew
that Frances had tumbled downstairs
and set her nose bleeding; she
could hear Anne crying pathetically for
mother to come and rock her to sleep,
and she was almost sure that every
thing was at sixes and sevens in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"But I will not lose my courage!"
she exclaimed vehemently, and, in
proof that she would not, burst into
hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>The fifth girl grew apace, and after
her came Josephine, and after Josephine
came Jane.</p>

<p>"Mr. Willian is among the blessed,"
said the priest when this seventh
daughter was carried to him for baptism.
"<i>Verily, he shall not be confounded
when he shall speak to his
enemies in the gate.</i>"</p>

<p>Others besides the priest had their
jest concerning this regiment of girls.
Tradesmen smiled when purchases
were made for them, people laughed
and counted when invitations were
to be sent to them, neighbors went
to their windows to see the Willian
procession start for church. They
became proverbial, especially with
their father.</p>

<p>But as years passed, words of praise
began to drop in among the jests.
Mothers marvelled to see how early
the Willian girls learned to sew and
mend, how deftly they could use the
broom and duster, what womanly
ways the elder had toward the
younger. These mothers reproachfully
told their shiftless daughters
what a dignified and careful maiden
Miss Eva was, and how even Anne
could put a room to rights after the
smaller fry, and sing Jenny to sleep
with a voice like a bobolink's. For
all these children took to singing as
naturally as birds do, and warbled
before they could speak.</p>

<p>Nor were their happy hearts less
valuable in the house than their helpful
hands. Half the mother's load
of care melted from her in the brightness
of their faces, and the anxious
cloud on Mr. Christopher Willian's
brow lightened in spite of him whenever
some gushing sprite, all laughter
and kisses, ran to welcome him home.
He was sometimes vexed on recollecting
how he had been lured from a
good grumble by their baby wiles.
Indeed, he was not nearly so dissatisfied
as he pretended to be. Such
sweet and healthy affections as theirs
were, which, never having been
checked, flowed out in joyous innocence;
such pure, unerring instincts,
that needed no knowledge of baseness
in order to shrink from its contact;
such open hands for the poor,
such tender hands for the afflicted;
and, crowning all, such steadfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[777]</a></span>
unassuming piety. Among the
young ladies who, dressed to attract
attention, promenaded the public
streets, the Willian girls were never
found; their father's house was the
place where they made new acquaintances
and entertained old ones. And
what did they conceal from their parents?
Nothing. Their hopes and
plans and fears, their mistakes, their
faults, all were freely told. And how
pretty they were! Their father secretly
made the most flowery comparisons
when looking at them. He
mentally challenged the dew-washed
morning roses and violets to vie with
their fresh faces around the breakfast
table. When at evening they formed
a ring of bloom around the piano,
and sang for their parents, or for
visitors, his private opinion was, that
a choir of angels could not far excel
them; and when the circle broke,
like a wreath falling into flowers, and
each went about some pretty employment,
then Mr. Willian had not
eyes enough with which to watch his
seven girls. But once own to any
such feeling, and there would be an
end to his privilege of grumbling.
He well knew what a chorus would
assail his first grievance: "Why,
papa, you said that we were&mdash;" etc.;
or, "Now, Mr. Willian, do be consistent!
With my own ears I have
heard you say&mdash;" etc. So he wrapped
the silver lining of his cloud inward,
and showed them only the
gray.</p>

<p>But one evening, for a wonder, he
came home with a joyful face and no
word of fault-finding. When Jenny,
the youngest, ran to meet him, he gave
her a toss nearly to the ceiling; he gave
one of Fanny's curls a pull in passing
her; he presented his wife with a bunch
of late flowers, he praised every thing
on the supper-table. Finally, when
they were gathered in the evening,
he told them the cause of this unusual
hilarity. He had that day made
the last payment on the building in
which he had his shop, and now their
weary economies were at an end.</p>

<p>"But don't imagine, you young
witches, that all this is to go in finery,"
he said, giving the nearest one a pinch
on the cheek. "The house here
needs a little fitting up, and perhaps
we will have a new piano. But I
must begin now to lay by something.
A man with such a load of girls on
his shoulders has to think of the future."</p>

<p>They were too much accustomed
to remarks like the last to be greatly
disturbed by them, but this threw a
momentary dampening. Then the
silence was broken by Miss Eva's calm
and musical voice: "The house needs
to be painted and papered and furnished
from basement to attic. It is
very shabby."</p>

<p>Mr. Willian forgot to exclaim at
the dimensions of this proposition
when he looked in the fair face of his
eldest daughter, and saw the serene
grace with which she seated herself
beside her mother, and smoothed down
the folds of her dress. Eva was now
twenty, calm, blonde, and stately.</p>

<p>"O papa!" cried Florence across
the fireplace; "do buy a lovely landscape
of Weber's we saw to-day. It
is just what we want to put over the
mantel-piece in the front parlor."
Again the father looked, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>Florence was a girl of artistic tastes,
was frail and excitable, and had brilliant
violet eyes and an unsteady scarlet
in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Now at last I can have a watch!"
cried Frances in a ringing voice. "I've
nearly got a curvature of the spine
from looking round at the clock to
see if I have practised long enough."</p>

<p>"My dear Fanny," interposed her
mother, "we need a new set of china
much more than you need a watch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[778]</a></span></p>

<p>Frances was the romp of the family,
a large girl of sixteen, with heaps of
brown curls around a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquante</i> face.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a little rosewood
writing-desk and a pearl pen-handle,"
came in a clear, insinuating voice very
high up the scale. Anne sat in a low
chair, with her chin in her hand, her
elbow on her knee, and her gaze fixed
intently on the cornice of the room.
But perceiving no notice taken of her
remark, she lowered her glance, and
gave her father a look out of the corners
of her eyes, which thereby got
the appearance of being nearly all
whites.</p>

<p>Anne was fourteen years of age,
and had a quiet way of doing as she
pleased and getting all she wanted
without seeming to try. Frances called
her pussy-cat.</p>

<p>"O papa!" broke in Georgiana,
"can't I have a pair of skates and
learn to skate?"</p>

<p>"I want a silver mug!" cried Jane,
the youngest, striking in before Josephine.</p>

<p>Josephine sat in the shadow of her
father's chair, and had two small
wrinkles between her brows.</p>

<p>"Is there any thing else any one
will have?" asked Mr. Willian with excessive
politeness, after having caught
breath. "Don't be bashful, I beg!
It is a pity there are only seven of
you, with your mother making eight.
Possibly by putting a mortgage on
the house, I may be able to gratify
your wishes. Speak up&mdash;do!"</p>

<p>Ever so slight a cloud settled upon
the gentleman's audience as he glanced
over them, bowing suavely, and
rubbing his hands with an appearance
of great cordiality.</p>

<p>"Papa!" came in a little voice out
of the shadow. Every one had forgotten
Josephine.</p>

<p>A real smile melted the waxen mask
of a smile on Mr. Willian's face.</p>

<p>"Poor Josie!" he said.</p>

<p>She came out of her corner and
stood by his side. "Papa, have you
got the block insured?" she asked.</p>

<p>Her father colored suddenly as he
put his arm about the child and drew
her closer to him. "Here girls," he
said, "is one who thinks of the means
as well as the end. She never will ruin
any one by her extravagance."</p>

<p>"But have you, papa?" she persisted.</p>

<p>"This house is all right, dear; and
I'm going to insure the store to-morrow."</p>

<p>He spoke carelessly, but there was
a slight stir of uneasiness perceptible
beneath.</p>

<p>His wife looked at him with surprise.
"Why, father, how happened
you to let it run out?"</p>

<p>"I was so busy to-day I forgot all
about it," he said almost pettishly.
"The policy expired only yesterday.
I'll see to it the first thing in the morning.
Go and sing something, girls."</p>

<p>All but Josie gathered about the
piano, and sang one of William Blake's
songs:</p>

<p>In the midst of the last soft strain
Eva's hands paused on the keys, her
sisters ceased singing, and her father
and mother lifted their faces to listen;
for a loud gamut of bells outside had
run up the first stroke of the fire-alarm.
At the last stroke, Mr. Willian started
up and went into the entry for his hat.
Not a word was said as he went out;
but the girls gathered about their
mother, and stood with the breath
just hovering on their lips, counting
the alarm over and over, hoping
against hope. But, no; they had
counted rightly at first. The loud
clear strokes through that silence left
no room for doubt.</p>

<p>The girls drew nearer their mother,
their faces losing color.</p>

<p>"I can't bear the suspense, Eva,"
she said. "Get our bonnets, and we
will go down-town. Don't cry, Josie!
You children all stay here and
say the rosary while we are gone.
We will soon be back, and perhaps
we shall bring good news."</p>

<p>Florence took her beads from her
pocket, put her arm around the weeping
Josie, and drew her down to her
knees before their mother's chair.
Mrs. Willian glanced back as the
others knelt too, then shut the door,
breathing a blessing on them. "If
it should be God's will to spare us
now," she said, "I shall be the happiest
mother in the world."</p>

<p>It was not God's will to spare
them, she soon found. As they turned
the last corner and came in sight
of Mr. Willian's building, they saw
it the centre of a vast crowd, firemen,
volunteer workers, and lookers-on.
There was no appearance of fire in
the lower stories, but smoke was gushing
through all the interstices of the
upper windows.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willian wrung her hands and
turned away. "There go the savings
and toil of a lifetime!" she said.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the firemen
to work well at that height, and the
flames were creeping to the air. In
a few minutes the smoke reddened, a
little tongue of flame crept through
a crevice, broadened, and the fire
burst forth. No effort could stay it.
Leisurely descending from floor to
floor, it carried all before it. A thread
of smoke in a corner of the ceiling,
a tiny flame, and soon the whole
room would be an intolerable brightness
with masses of falling flaming
timbers.</p>

<p>At midnight the family were all at
home again; Mr. Willian lying half-senseless
upon a sofa, his wife and
children ministering to him. In his
frantic efforts to save something from
the burning building, one of his arms
had been broken by the falling bricks.</p>

<p>Those were sorrowful days that followed,
verifying the proverb that it
never rains but it pours. Josephine
was taken ill the week after the fire;
but she was sure to be well soon,
they said. She was not very ill.
There was a little cough, a little fever,
and a great weakness. The girls
thought not much of it. They were
too much engaged, indeed, attending
to their father, and doing an immense
deal of mysterious outside business.</p>

<p>"If Eva were only a boy!" sighed
the father weakly. "A boy of twenty
could earn a good salary."</p>

<p>"Father," Eva began very decidedly,
"a girl of twenty can earn a
good salary. Let me tell you what
your good-for-nothing daughters are
going to do. We haven't been idle
the fortnight past. I am to take immediate
charge of a class in the N&mdash;&mdash;
school, with a salary of five hundred
dollars to begin with, and a yearly
advance. I shall stay at home, by
your leave, and nearly all my money
will go toward the housekeeping expenses.
Besides that, I have a music
class of four. So much for me. I
doubt if that wonderful son would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">[780]</a></span>
spare you more out of his earnings.
Florence is to take a few more lessons
in Indian-ink from Mr. Rudolf, and
he says that in four or five weeks she
will be able to earn ten dollars a
week, painting photographs. Frances
has got tatten and crochet-work
to do for Blake Brothers, and they
promise to pay her well. She does
such work beautifully. Anne is to
cut out paper bordering for Mr. Sales,
who is building blocks upon blocks
of houses. He says that he will keep
her busy three months. Georgiana is
to help mother about the house, and
Dinah is going away. So now, father,
you can lie on your sofa and
rest, and your troublesome daughters
will not let you starve."</p>

<p>Miss Eva ended with her cheeks
very red, and her head very high in
the air. But her pride softened immediately
when she saw her father's
quivering lips, that vainly attempted
to speak.</p>

<p>"It is our turn now, dear papa,"
she said, kissing him; "and we are
quite proud and eager to begin. You
have cast your bread upon the waters
in former times; now you must
lie still and see it float back to you."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" asked a weak
little voice from the arm-chair where
Josie reclined.</p>

<p>"You can see which will get well
the most quickly, you or papa," Mrs.
Willian said, bending with tearful
eyes to caress the child. In this
careful little one she saw embodied
all the unconfessed sadness and anxiety
of the one despondent period of
her life. Poor Josie was the scape-goat
on whose frail shoulders had
been laid her mother's doubts and
fears, and her father's selfish complaining.</p>

<p>Success almost always attends brave
and cheerful effort, and the Willian
girls succeeded. Besides, they were
heroines in their way, and every one
was sympathizing and helpful to
them. But for their father's depression,
they would have been happier
than ever before. At last they were
of use, and not only of use, but necessary.
They were no longer a burden
tenderly but complainingly borne,
but they bore the family cares and
labors on their own young shoulders.
What wonderful consultations they
held, what plans they laid, what economies
they practised! What latent
administrative powers were developed
at the hour of need, and what
superlative managers they proved
themselves to be! How elastic a little
money could be made when smoothed
out by such coaxing taper fingers,
and shone upon by such bright and
careful eyes! Besides, they could not
see but that they lived as well as ever.
Their breakfasts and dinners and suppers
were as good, and their home
was the same.</p>

<p>"Half the pleasure of wealth is in
the consciousness of possessing it,"
said Florence philosophically. "Was
it John Jacob Astor who said that all
he had from his riches was food and
lodging? Well, we have that. Of
course it is a pity that papa's arm is
still bad, though it gives him time to
develop his capacity for novels. What!
ascetical works are they? Yes; but
I have seen novels too, papa. And
here's a new one for you. Take it
easy. Just lie there and make believe
that you have become so rich that
you have retired from business. Oh!
what blocks of houses you have.
What ships, what lands, what bank-stock!
Isn't it weary to think what
heaps of money you have to spend
and give away. Don't let's think
about it!"</p>

<p>"I came past the ruins of the fire
to-day, papa," Eva said, seating herself
by his sofa, and looking at him
with her calm, sweet eyes. "At first
I was so foolish as to shrink and turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[781]</a></span>
my head away, but the next moment
I looked. And I thought, papa, that
may be what has seemed to us a calamity
may turn out a great blessing.
We had built a good many hopes
into that brick and mortar, and instead
of the fire destroying, perhaps
it has only purified them." Seeing
that tears came into his eyes, she
added hastily, "Fanny was with me,
and, of course, took a grotesque view
of the affair. She said that row of
tall buildings, with ours gone, looked
like somebody who had lost a front
tooth."</p>

<p>Mr. Willian smiled faintly, but
could answer nothing to their cheerful
talk. Even while it comforted
him, it made him feel bitterly ashamed
of himself. Besides, he was very
anxious about Josie.</p>

<p>It came upon them like a thunderbolt:
Josie was dying! They could
scarcely believe the doctor, or the
evidence of their own senses. They
hoped against hope. There was no
definable disease; but the child was
dying merely because, instead of having
had a healthy, careless childhood,
and time to learn gradually that life
is not all joy and sunshine, her infant
eyes had looked too early upon the
cross of pain, and she had seen the
shadow and felt the weight of it before
she could understand its consolation.</p>

<p>"That'll make one less, papa," she
said faintly, looking up with faded
eyes as he bent over her.</p>

<p>"One less what, my dear?"</p>

<p>"One less girl to support," says
Josie.</p>

<p>The father's face sank to the pillow.
Oh! what a bitter punishment
for his selfish complainings, when his
own child, in dying out of his arms,
thought only that she was ridding
him of a burden! He could scarcely
find words in which to sob out his
love, his regrets, his entreaties that
her tender spirit might be spared at
least long enough to witness his expiation.
But even while he prayed
it escaped him. He clasped only a
frail waxen form that answered no
kiss, uttered no more any childish,
plaintive word.</p>

<p>"God forgive me!" he said. "Now
I know what real loss is; and I deserve
it."</p>

<p>How they missed the careful, pathetic
little face! How often they
became suddenly speechless when, in
laying their plans&mdash;they found that
they had unconsciously included Josie!
But they worked on bravely in
spite of pain&mdash;worked the better for
it, indeed. And when in after-years,
all happy and prosperous and with
homes of their own, they talked over
the past, and Mr. Willian told of the
wonderful time when his daughters
had made caryatides of themselves to
support the edifice of his fallen fortunes,
Josie was gratefully mentioned
as the noblest helper there. "For it
was by her means that the cornerstone
of our new home was laid in
heaven," he said.</p>

<h2>RELIGION IN EDUCATION.</h2>


<p>In every century there has arisen
some question which, by reason of its intrinsic
importance, or immediate influence
on society, may be called the problem
of the age. Our century, though
differing in so many respects from all
the others, is not, however, an exception
to this seeming law of history.
Not a few long-standing grievances
have been righted, knotty political
intricacies severed, and brilliant scientific
triumphs achieved; yet important
as was the emancipation of 1829 or
the disestablishment of 1869, the laying
of the transmarine cable, or the
cutting of Suez, we believe with the
<cite>Dublin Review</cite> that the great problem
of our age is the adjustment of the oft-debated
educational question. Much
has been said, many editorials have
been written, and pamphlets published
on this subject. It has afforded
a noble theme for such orators
as Lacordaire, Montalembert, and
Archbishop Hughes; and a trying
task for the skill and practical wisdom
of such eminent statesmen as Thiers,
Lord Derby, and Gladstone. We
know no better proof of the vital importance
of education, than the active
part thus taken in its discussion
by men of every religious persuasion
and political shade. In fact, few questions
affect so directly the welfare and
interests of the people; and assuredly
in this country there is none of
more moment as regards the well-being
and permanence of our national
institutions.</p>

<p>Two centuries ago, Leibnitz declared
the proper training of youth
to be "the foundation of human happiness;"
in the last century, Washington
called it the "pillar" of society;
and in our own, Bishop Dupanloup
assures us that it and it alone "forms
the greatness of a nation, maintains
its splendor, and prevents decay."
But it may be argued that intellectual
discipline without the coÃ¶peration of
any religious element will produce
these great and inestimable results.
This we deny. Did polite literature,
for instance, save the most refined nation
of antiquity? Listen to the masters
of the lyre bewailing the degradation
of their countrymen, and sighing
for a purer and loftier virtue than
any their religion could inspire. Did
the plastic arts? Phidias and Apelles
will return the melancholy answer.
The eloquence of the orator? The
noblest appeals of duty, the most patriotic
harangue or spirit-stirring philippic
palled alike upon a degenerate
race. The wisdom of the legislator?
All the sagacity of Solon and Lycurgus
could but retard the downfall of
the country. In fine, did philosophy?
Its schools were often sinks of
immorality, and vice. A few great
minds, indeed, rose above the absurd
creations of mythology, and taught
the precepts of natural morality;
but, like the dragon-fly of the tropics,
they flitted across the night of paganism,
lights to themselves and mere
ornaments of the surrounding darkness.
No wonder that the Grecian
states declined, that their last day
soon "quivered on the dial of their
doom," and that they went down into
a night which never knew a morrow.
The Romans once added to the speculative
wisdom of the Greeks an
almost heroic practice of all the natural
virtues. Yet they, too, were
swept by a torrent of vice into the
common tomb of nations; and only
a few broken columns remain to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[783]</a></span>
to tell the traveller what was once
the seat of a world-wide empire.</p>

<p>Separate religion, then, from education,
as Mr. John Stuart Mill would
fain do; banish it entirely from the
class-room, and you will have taken
the most effective means of insuring
proximate dissoluteness and ultimate
ruin. Even the author of <cite>Lothair</cite> recognizes
that "without religion the
world must soon become a scene of
universal desolation." If, when children
are asked how they are occupied
in school, they cannot say with the
Joas of Racine,</p>

<p class="center">
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'adore le Seigneur, on m'explique sa loi</span>,"<br />
</p>

<p>sooner or later, we may have to say
with Abner,</p>

<p class="center">
"Juda est sans force, Benjamin sans vertu."<br />
</p>

<p>Intellectual culture, therefore, even
in its highest perfection, can gain at
best but an ephemeral triumph. It
cannot perpetuate the civilization to
which a people in the meridian of
their greatness may attain; and it certainly
has never raised a fallen empire,
nor poured a quickening stream
through the veins of a superannuated
nation. This inefficiency can be accounted
for only by the absence of
that pure and sublime faith which
commanded the respect of the hordes
that poured from the north, to batter
down the last remains of a gigantic
fabric, as well as of that sublime moral
code which tamed these rude nomads
and raised them from a savage
state to the loftiest heights of
Christian civilization.</p>

<p>The term education is from the Latin
<i>e</i> and <i>duco</i>, meaning literally to
lead or draw out. Some writers have
attempted to define it "the drawing
out or development of the mental faculties."
This may be a "scientific"
view of head-culture; but as a definition
of education, it is defective and
very unphilosophical. Defective, because
it embraces only a part;
unphilosophical, because it substitutes
the secondary for the essential. We
maintain that instruction is but a
branch of education, to which religion
is as the parent stem. If we
consult the masters of thought, and
those who shape the destinies of nations,
we shall be surprised to find
how unanimously they hold moral
training paramount to intellectual culture,
and how strongly they insist on
making the latter always subservient
to the former. The better to substantiate
our assertion against the cavillings
of sceptics, we will give a few
quotations, selecting only from Protestant
authors. The end of education,
according to Milton, "is to fit
man to perform justly, skilfully, and
magnanimously all the offices both
public and private of peace and war."
"The hard and valuable part of education,"
says Locke, "is virtue; this
is the solid and substantial good
which the teacher should never cease
to inculcate till the young man places
his strength, his glory, and his pleasure
in it." "The educating of a
young man," writes Lord Kames,
"to behave well in society is of still
greater importance than making him
a Solomon in knowledge;" and "We
shall never know," says Sir Walter
Scott, "our real calling or destiny,
unless we have taught ourselves to
consider every thing else as moon-shine
compared with the education
of the heart." And Lord Derby:
"Religion is not a thing apart from
education, but is interwoven with its
whole system; it is a principle which
controls and regulates the whole mind
and happiness of the people." And
Guizot: "Popular education, to be
truly good and socially useful, must
be fundamentally religious."</p>

<p>Thus, then, the essential element
of education&mdash;its pith and marrow, so
to speak&mdash;is the religious element. To
exclude it from the school-room is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[784]</a></span>
therefore, a crying injustice to the rising
generation and a crime against
society.</p>

<p>It is not one portion of the "triple
man," but the whole&mdash;the physical,
intellectual, and moral being&mdash;the
body, the mind, the head&mdash;that must be
cultivated and "brought up." Neglect
any one part of man's nature,
and you at once disturb the equilibrium
of the whole, and produce disorder;
educate the body at the expense
of the mind and soul, and you will
have only animated clay; educate
the intelligence at the expense of the
moral and religious feelings, and you
but fearfully increase a man's power
to effect evil. You store the arsenal
of his mind with weapons to sap alike
the altar and the throne, to carry on
a war of extermination against every
holy principle, against the welfare and
the very existence of society.</p>

<p>Catiline, the polished patrician,
was more dreaded by the Roman
senate than the steel of his hired assassins.
The French revolution, the
most violent outbreak that ever convulsed
society, was ushered in by a
blaze of genius; but, like the high intelligence
of the "archangel ruined,"
it brought desolation and death in its
fiery track. Science without religion
is more destructive than the sword in
the hands of unprincipled men. "Talent
if divorced from rectitude," says
Channing, "will prove more of a demon
than a god." It is these enlightened
infidels that arrest the progress
of true civilization and prepare those
terrible catastrophes which deluge a
country with blood. Who were the
leaders in the work of destruction and
wholesale butchery in the Reign of
Terror? The nurslings of lyceums in
which the chaotic principles of the
"philosophers" were proclaimed as
oracles of truth. Who are those turbulent
revolutionists who now long to
erect the guillotine by the Tuileries?
And who are those secret conspirators
and their myrmidon partisans who
have sworn to unify Italy or lay it in
ruins? Men who were taught to scout
the idea of a God and rail at religion; to
consider Christianity as a thing of the
past and a legion of "isms" as the
regenerators of the future; men who
revel in wild chimeras by night, and
seek to realize their mad dreams by
day.</p>

<p>The frightful excesses to which irreligion
directly leads so struck one of
the most frantic revolutionists of 1793
that, yet dripping with blood, he
mounted to the pediment of a temple
and with a pencil wrote this memorable
inscription, "The French nation
recognizes the existence of a Supreme
Being;" and a few hours before ascending
the scaffold to suffer the just
penalty of his enormities, he cried out
to his countrymen, "The republic can
only be established on the eternal bases
of morality." Terrible confession
wrung from a regicide in the most
impious moment of history!</p>

<p>Robespierre proclaimed the truth.
The only safety for a commonwealth,
the only source of greatness and prosperity
for a nation, as well as of tranquillity
and happiness for the individual,
is religion. When men reject its heavenly
guidance, duty becomes as void
of meaning to them as "honor" was
to a well-known Shakespearean character,
the most sacred obligations dwindle
down into mere optional practices,
and the moral code itself soon becomes
little more than the bugbear of the
weak-minded. "The safeguard of morality,"
says De Tocqueville, "is religion;"
and he concludes a chapter
of his <cite>American Republic</cite> with the
following pertinent remark: "Religion
is the companion of liberty in all
its battles and triumphs; the cradle
of its infancy, and the divine source
of its claims; it is the safeguard of
morality, and morality is the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">[785]</a></span>
security of law as well as the surest
pledge of freedom."</p>

<p>The philosophers of the eighteenth
century, by their monstrous errors
and shameless depravity, have shown
but too clearly that science without
religion</p>

<p class="center">
"Leads to bewilder, and dazzles to blind."<br />
</p>

<p>These vaunted <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprits forts</i> had entered
the realms of learning and returned
as conquerors laden with treasures;
but instead of consecrating the spoil
to the service of the true, the good,
and the beautiful, they paid it as a
votive tribute to the evil genius of
license and disorder. The world then
saw these very men to whom princes
had offered the incense of adulation enthrone
an impure goddess on the altar
of the Most High, and fall prostrate
before a public harlot.</p>

<p>If further proof were needed of the
immoral tendency of science separated
from religion, we could silently point
to the nameless abominations of the
Communists, Fourierists, and other
such vile and degraded fraternities; we
could dwell on the cold-blooded murders
and frightful suicides that fill so
many domestic hearths with grief and
shame; the scarcely concealed corruption
of public and professional
men; the adroit peculation and wilful
embezzlement of the public money;
those monopolizing speculations and
voluntary insolvencies so ruinous to
the community at large; and, above all,
those shocking atrocities so common
in unbelieving countries&mdash;the legal
dissolution of the matrimonial tie and
the wanton tampering with life in its
very bud. These humiliating facts
are sufficient to convince any impartial
mind that there can be no social
virtue, no morality, no true and lasting
greatness without religion.</p>

<p>Here we meet the question, When
should these salutary doctrines be inculcated?
As well might it be asked
when the builder should lay the foundation
of his edifice, or the farmer sow
his field. If religious principles be
not laid broad and deep in childhood,
there is great danger that the superstructure
will topple and fall. Youth
has been called the seed-time of life;
and experience as well as reason
proves the same law to hold good in
mental as in material husbandry;
"What you sow that you shall reap."
Men do not seek grapes from thorns,
nor figs from thistles. Yet, by a
strange inconsistency, some would
expect virtuous youths from godless
schools. But the order of nature
cannot be reversed. Like generates
like.</p>

<p>In childhood the mind is simple
and docile; the soul, pure and candid;
and the heart may easily be
cast into any mould. It is of the
highest importance for parents and
educators to bear in mind that the
first impressions are the last forgotten.
The pious child may in after-life, in
an evil hour, be led astray by the force
of passion or bad example, but
at least, when the fires of youth have
cooled with advancing age, there is
great probability that he will return
again to virtue and piety. With
great truth the poet has said,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Take care in youth to form the heart and mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>One of the greatest thinkers of our
age, thoroughly convinced of the paramount
importance of early moral
training, would have the air of the
school-room, as it were, impregnated
with religion. "It is necessary,"
says Guizot, "that natural education
should be given and received in the
midst of a religious atmosphere, and
that religious impressions and religious
observances should penetrate
all its parts." It would, indeed, be
well if those who advocate the exclusion
of religion from our schools
would read and maturely weigh these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[786]</a></span>
words of the illustrious Protestant
statesman and historian. A little
further on occurs the following remarkable
passage: "Religion is not
a study or an exercise, to be restricted
to a certain place and a certain hour;
it is a faith and a law which ought
to be felt everywhere, and which in
this manner alone can exercise all its
beneficent influence upon our minds
and lives." In the same spirit Disraeli
says, "Religion should be the
rule of life, not a casual incidence."
It is then absurd to devote six days
of the week to the teaching of human
learning, and trust to a hurried
hour in the Sunday-school for the
imparting of religious knowledge. By
such a system, we may make expert
shop-boys, first-rate accountants,
shrewd and thriving "earth-worms,"
as Bishop Berkeley says; but it would
be presumption to think of thus making
good citizens, still less virtuous
Christians.</p>

<p>To-day more than ever we need a
thorough religious education. The
enemies of Christianity are now making
war upon its dogmas more generally
and craftily than at any former
period. Their attacks, for being wily
and concealed, are all the more pernicious.
The impious rage of a Voltaire,
or the "solemn sneer" of a
Gibbon, would be less dangerous
than this insidious warfare. They
disguise their designs under the appearance
of devotion to progressive
ideas, hatred of superstition and intolerance,
all the better to instil the slow
but deadly poison. By honeyed
words, a studied candor, a dazzle of
erudition, they have spread their
"gossamer nets of seduction" over
the world. The press teems with
books and journals in which doctrines
subversive of religion and morality
are so elegantly set forth that the unguarded
reader, like Roger in Ariosto,
is very apt to be deceived by the fascination
of false charms, and to mistake
a most hideous and dangerous
object for the very type of beauty.
The serpent stealthily glides under
the silken verdure of a polished style.
Nothing is omitted. The passions
are fed and the morbid sensibilities
pandered to; firmness in the cause
of truth or virtue is called obstinacy;
and strength of soul, a refractory
blindness. The bases of morality
are sapped in the name of liberty;
the discipline of the church, when
not branded as sheer "mummery,"
is held up as hostile to personal freedom;
and her dogmas with one or
two exceptions are treated as opinions
which may be received or rejected
with like indifference.</p>

<p>Nor is this irreligious tendency
confined to literary publications; it
finds numerous and powerful advocates
in men of scientific pursuits,
who, like Belial in Milton, "strive
to make the worse appear the better
cause." The chemist has never
found in his crucible that intangible
something which men call spirit;
so, in the name of science, he pronounces
it a myth. The anatomist
has dissected the human frame; but
failing to meet the immaterial substance&mdash;the
soul, he denies its existence.
The physicist has weighed
the conflicting theories of his predecessors
in the scales of criticism; and
finally decides that bodies are nothing
more than the accidental assemblage
of atoms, and rejects the very
idea of a Creator. The geologist,
after investigating the secrets of the
earth, triumphantly tells us that he
has accumulated an overwhelming
mass of facts to refute the biblical
cosmogony and thus subvert the authority
of the inspired record. The
astronomer flatters himself that he
has discovered natural and necessary
laws which do away with the necessity
of admitting that a divine hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[787]</a></span>
once launched the heavenly bodies
into space and still guides them in
their courses; the ethnographer has
studied the peculiarities of the races,
he has met with widely-different
conformations, and believes himself
sufficiently authorized to deny the
unity of the human family; in a word,
they conclude that nothing exists but
matter, that God is a myth, and the
soul "the dream of a dream."</p>

<p>Thus do men attack these sacred
truths which, in the words of Balmes,
"cannot be shaken without greatly
injuring and finally destroying the
social edifice." What, then, must be
done to save society from the perils
that menace it&mdash;to stem the tide that
bids fair to sweep away eventually
even civilization itself? What is the
remedy for the profligacy that disgraces
some of our crowded centres,
and the demoralization that is fast
gangrening our rural districts? There
is <em>one</em>, and we believe there is <em>but</em>
one. Let the rising generation be
"brought up" in a "religious atmosphere."
If we Christianize our youth,
we may be sure of having a virtuous
and a virile people; for it is an ethical
truth, that "the morals are but
the outward forms of the inner life."</p>

<p>The Father of our country, then,
was right, when he said, in his farewell
address to the American nation,
that religion and morality are the
"props" of society and the "pillars"
of the state. History tells in its every
page that the decline and downfall
of nations have ever been caused by
immorality and irreligion.</p>

<p>Our national institutions, our prosperity
and civilization depend for
their permanence and perpetuity not
so much on the culture of the arts,
sciences, literature, or philosophy, as
on the general diffusion of the salutary
and vivifying principles of religion.</p>

<p>Let us then infuse good morals by
the most powerful of all means, Christian
education; let doctrine be taught

<h2>THE JOURNAL OF THE CAMPAIGN OF CLAUDE BLANCHARD,<br />

<small>COMMISSARY-GENERAL TO THE AUXILIARY TROOPS SENT TO AMERICA UNDER
THE COMMAND OF LIEUTENANT-GENERAL THE COUNT DE
ROCHAMBEAU. 1780-1783.</small></h2>


<p>"I spent three years, in the capacity
of commissary-general, with the
body of troops which General Rochambeau
brought to the assistance
of the Americans. During the entire
war, I wrote down every day, dating
from our departure from Brest, both
the events I witnessed, and those that
were personal. This journal is not
in very good order, and now that
I have leisure, (Messidor, second year
of the Republic,) I intend to copy it
out clearly, without making any important
change in either the style or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">[788]</a></span>
the matter. I wrote, however, merely
for my own amusement, and for an occupation
in idle moments."</p>

<p>Thus begins a manuscript, hitherto
unpublished and entirely unknown,
which appears worthy of being noticed
and rescued from oblivion. The
author of this journal, Commissary
Blanchard, became later commissary-general,
but was deprived of this position
by the government of the Reign
of Terror, whose persecutions at the
time&mdash;the eve of the fall of Robespierre&mdash;ending
generally in a sentence
of death, he hid himself in Paris.
Such is the leisure he speaks of in
the passage cited above; leisure very
short, however, and which he occupied
in the manner indicated, by
reviewing his notes of past times and
collecting his personal reminiscences
of the American expedition so dear
to all who had taken part in it. Soon
afterward he was restored to active
service, and thought no more, in a
career occupied with the wars of
the period, of the manuscript which
he had not intended for publicity, and
which, after his death in 1803, remained
forgotten among family papers, as
so many other documents have which
are still unknown. Compared with
the works published on the same
events which he writes of, this journal,
now ninety years old, certainly
has its own value and special interest.
It is apparent from the first lines of
the manuscript, quoted at the beginning
of this article, that M. Blanchard
wrote without special thought&mdash;merely
for his own satisfaction, and prompted
by the natural desire to note down
whatever he saw, without any intention
of composing a history or a
book of memoirs. This is an excellent
disposition for sincerity, and our
epoch loves and prefers to all others
these unstudied writings, when they
refer, as they do in this case, to interesting
periods of the past.</p>

<p>The author of this journal was forty
years of age at the time of the
American war. Though now completely
forgotten, he attracted considerable
attention in his day, and he figures
in the "Biographies Universelles"
of the beginning of the century.
Born at Angers, on the 16th of
May, 1742, and sprung from a distinguished
family of that city, he
appears, for the first time in 1762
in the war bureau, under the orders
of one of his relations, M. Dubois,
"Chief of the War Bureau and
General Secretary of the Swiss and
Grisons."<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> He was appointed commissary
in 1768, and served in this capacity
throughout the Corsican campaign,
remaining on the island ten
years. As commissary-general, in
1780 he accompanied General Rochambeau
to America. In 1788, he
was commissary at Arras, where the
following year he was put in command
of the national guard of the
city; and soon afterward became,
with Carnot, then unknown, its representative
in the legislative assembly.
Here M. Blanchard played a modest
but active and useful part, and he,
with LacuÃ©e and Matthieu Dumas,
formed the standing committee on
military questions. Removed by the
Committee of Public Safety, he afterward
held the position of commissary-general
successively to the army of
Sambre-et-Meuse, to that of the interior,
to the army of Holland, and
finally to the Hotel des Invalides,
where he died, leaving the reputation
of an officer "remarkable for his
talents and virtues."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>The First Consul, on hearing of his
death, expressed deep regret, according
to the testimony of General LacuÃ©e.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[789]</a></span>Blanchard, although at the time but
sixty years of age, was the oldest
among the commissaries of the army.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The journal of M. Blanchard will
give a more correct idea of the character
of the man, of his upright and
honest nature, and of his strong and
good sense. A few words are necessary,
however, on the events of which
we have to speak, and of the writers
who have related them at first hand.</p>

<p>The violent struggle of the English
colonies against the mother country
began in 1775; Declaration of
the Independence of the United States&mdash;the
hundredth anniversary of which
is near at hand&mdash;was made on the
4th of July, 1776. Soon afterward,
when the Americans were hard pressed,
France came to their aid, and the war
with England opened with the fight
at Ouessant on the 17th of June, 1778.
It was at first a naval war which
spread over the whole ocean. Subsequently,
when the American cause
was in a most critical condition,
France, at the request of Congress,
sent pecuniary assistance, and also a
body of troops, who were placed under
the chief command of General
Washington.</p>

<p>This war, in which we acquired
glory at sea, and which raised up our
navy&mdash;this reappearance of the white
flag in the new world, from which
the seven years' war had excluded
it<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>&mdash;the part taken by France in
establishing the independence of the
United States, and in founding a nation
destined for so grand a future&mdash;are
events of far more than ordinary
importance, and which possess the
same interest to-day as when they
transpired. Nevertheless their details
are, as a general thing, but imperfectly
known; and particularly the
campaign of the corps sent to America,
which brought into close contact
the soldiers of old France and the
militia of the young republic, is in the
larger histories usually summed up in
a few lines.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> This doubtless arises
from the fact that no work of importance
has treated this subject in
a special manner. It is true that
the little army commanded by General
Rochambeau had few opportunities
of distinguishing itself. But, although
its active services were confined
to a few important marches,
and to the taking of York town, which
was forced to surrender, together with
a division of the English army, it
gave the Americans no inconsiderable
moral support, as well as effective assistance
which was most opportune.
The revolution which followed soon
after, and the twenty-five years of
war rendered glorious by so many
famous campaigns, effaced the remembrance
of the naval combat of
Chesapeake Bay and the taking of
Yorktown, and turned attention from
military operations which are insignificant,
if we consider the number of
troops engaged, but important, if we
look to the result. In fact, these
battles between a few thousand men,
decided the fate of one of the most
powerful of modern nations as well
as the future balance of the world.</p>

<p>It is not, however, because documents
on the American campaign are
wanting; on the contrary, they are numerous
and interesting; our archives
should possess intact the official reports;
while individual reminiscences
contained in a number of books
published at different times, are valuable
sources of information from
which as yet nothing has been drawn.
Four distinguished officers engaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">[790]</a></span>in this expedition among the French
(not to mention American or English
writers) have found pleasure in
recalling the memory and narrating
the incidents of what they considered
the noblest or the dearest portion of
their career; the <cite>MÃ©moires du MarÃ©chal
de Rochambeau</cite>, (1809,) the first
source of information, give with
clearness and precision, but without
embellishment, a detailed account of
the campaign which above all else
has served to render his name illustrious.
Next comes the <cite>Correspondance
et Manuscrits du GÃ©nÃ©ral La
Fayette</cite>, (1837,) although La Fayette
took part in the war of independence
as a volunteer and an American general,
independent of the action of the
royal forces. The <cite>Souvenirs du Comte
de SÃ©gur</cite>, (1835,) and those of <cite>Comte
Matthieu Dumas</cite>, (1839,) young and
brilliant aides-de-camp to General
Rochambeau, also furnish some particulars
about this campaign worthy
of note. We must not forget the
<cite>MÃ©moires du Duc de Lauzun</cite>, (1822,)
colonel of a regiment in the expeditionary
corps, and the <cite>Voyages dans
l'AmÃ©rique Septentrionale de M. le
Marquis de Chastellux</cite>, (1786,) major-general;
this work, though full of
description and of anecdote, is of
only moderate ability; but the name
of its author, a member of the Academy
and a friend of Voltaire, gave
it a certain degree of success at the
time of its appearance, owing to curiosity
and to circumstances.</p>

<p>After these works, which possess
each a peculiar interest, and without
pretending to the importance which
they derive from the names of their
distinguished authors, the journal of
Commissary Blanchard (who is mentioned
in all of them) deserves certainly
an honorable place. It is remarkable
for great exactness, variety
of information, and a genial and pleasant
tone. Moreover, as it is devoted
solely to the American expedition, it
is naturally more diffuse on this special
subject than books which treat
of an entire life.</p>

<p>We shall now let the journal speak
for itself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Lieutenant-General the Count de Rochambeau,
having been appointed to the command
of the corps which was under orders
to embark, although their destination was
not yet positively known, engaged me to
serve with these troops, in my capacity of
commissary.</p>

<p>"I accordingly repaired to Brest on the
20th of March, 1780. M. de TarlÃ©, commissary
of provisions, who performed the
duties of purveyor to the troops, did not
arrive for eight or ten days after; he
brought me a commission as commissary-in-chief.
Finding myself alone at Brest, I
assisted both the land and naval commanders
to ship all the supplies and whatever
would be necessary for the troops after they
had landed. As the navy had not been able
to furnish a sufficient number of transports,
they were obliged to leave in France the
regiments of Neustrie and Anhalt, which
were to have accompanied the expedition
as well as two or three hundred men of
the legion of Lauzun. Those who embarked
numbered five thousand, consisting of
the regiments of Bourbonnais, Soissonnais,
Saintonge, Royal-deux-Ponts, about five
hundred artillery-men, and six hundred of
the legion of Lauzun, of whom three hundred
were to form a body of cavalry. These
troops, their baggage, the artillery, and
other things necessary to an army, were
put on board twenty-five to thirty transports
or store-ships; they were accompanied
by seven vessels of war and seven frigates.
La Fantasque, an old vessel, was
armed as a store-ship and intended for a
hospital; they put on board of her the
money, the heavy artillery, and a considerable
number of passengers.</p>

<p>"All the general officers slept on board
the 14th of April; I was there also, and
embarked on the ConquÃ©rant, commanded
by La GrandiÃ¨re.</p>

<p>"The following are the names of the principal
persons who composed our army:</p>

<p>"Count de Rochambeau, lieutenant-general,
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>"The Baron de ViomÃ©nil, the Count de
ViomÃ©nil, the Chevalier de Chastellux, field-marshals,
(the last mentioned performs the
duties of a major-general.)</p>

<p>"De BÃ©ville, brigadier-general and quartermaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">[791]</a></span>
(de Choisy, brigadier, did not
arrive till the 30th of September.)</p>

<p>"De TarlÃ©, general commissary, acting
as purveyor.</p>

<p>"Blanchard, commissary-general.</p>

<p>"De Corny, de Villemanzy, chief of ordnance.</p>

<p>"D'Aboville, commander-in-chief of artillery.</p>

<p>"DÃ©sandrouins, commander of the engineers.</p>

<p>"Daure, purveyor of provisions.</p>

<p>"Demars, purveyor of the hospitals.</p>

<p>"There were yet many other purveyors,
for forage, meat, etc.; in general there
were too many employed, particularly as
purveyors-in-chief; all this was according
to the taste of M. de VeymÃ©rangers, in
whose hands had been left the organization
of the commissary department of our army;
a man skilful in business matters, but given
to expense and extravagance, and who needed
looking after.</p>

<p>"M. de MÃ©nonville and the Chevalier de
TarlÃ©, brother of the commissary, were general
staff officers; M. de BÃ©ville junior,
and M. Collot, were assistant quartermasters.</p>

<p>"M. de Rochambeau had for his aides-de-camp
M. de Fersey, de Damas, Charles
Lameth, Closen, Matthieu Dumas, LamberdiÃ©re,
de Vauban, and Cromot-Dubourg.</p>

<p>"M. de ViomÃ©nil had also several, among
whom were MM. de Chabannes, de Pange,
d'Olonne, etc.</p>

<p>"Those of M. de Chastellux were MM.
Montesquieu, grandson of the president,
and Lynch, an Irishman.</p>

Deux-Ponts, brothers.</p>

<p>"Of the Saintonge, MM. de Custine and

<p>I have copied this page because it
shows to some extent the formation
of the staff of an army corps of the
last century, and also on account of
the names which it gives. They are
those of the very highest nobility of
France, who threw themselves with
enthusiasm into this expedition, which
they called the "crusade of the eighteenth
century."</p>

<p>Among the companions in arms of
M. Blanchard, whose names often recur
in his journal, many who were
then young afterward became celebrated.
Not to speak of two generals
already distinguished, Rochambeau
and La Fayette, and the Chevalier,
later the Marquis, de Chastellux,
known by his connection with the encyclopedists,
and who died in 1788,
the following are worthy of mention:
Biron (the Duke de Lauzun) and Custine,
two generals of the republic,
who shared the same tragic fate; the
Prince de Broglie, field-marshal in
the army of the Rhine, indicted before
the revolutionary tribunal, and
executed in 1794; the Count de Dillon,
general in 1792, falsely accused
of treason, put to death by his troops,
and to whom the Convention, in gratitude
for his devotion, decreed the
honors of the Pantheon; Pichegru,
at that time only an artillery-man; the
Viscount de Noailles, who, on the
famous night of the fourth of August,
was the first to propose the abolition
of the feudal laws; (his military future
promised to be brilliant when he died
in consequence of a wound received
in the expedition to San Domingo.)
By the side of these men, whose careers
were cut short by death, we
find others whose lives were long and
illustrious. Berthier, then an under-officer,
destined to become marshal of
France and minister of war, Prince
of Wagram and NeufchÃ¢tel, etc. The
Count de SÃ©gur, general, diplomatist,
historian, whose son, equally distinguished
and still alive, is the author
of the <i>Campaign of</i> 1812, that touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">[792]</a></span>
recital of an eye-witness. Matthieu
Dumas, a general, an able commissary
and esteemed military writer,
a peer of France in 1830; Aubert-Dubayet,
an inferior officer in the expeditionary
corps, minister of war under
the republic.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> The Duke de Damas,
the faithful companion of the
Bourbons during their exile; Charles
de Lameth, equally brilliant in speech
and in action, a member of the assembly,
lieutenant-general in 1814,
deputy, and peer of France. The
Count de Vauban, aide-de-camp to
the Count d'Artois, who fought in
the army of CondÃ© and of Quiberon;
the Duke de Castries, who died in
1842, a peer of France, etc.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July 1780, after a
voyage of sixty-nine days, America
was signalled by the French squadron.
Nevertheless, the disembarkment did
not take place at Newport, Rhode
Island, for some days after.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 12th, the troops had not yet landed;
there had even been an express prohibition
against their going ashore; and I had
not permission to do so until four o'clock
in the afternoon. I then landed at Newport.
This town is small and pretty; the streets
are straight, and the houses, though for the
most part built of wood, make a good appearance.
There was an illumination in
the evening. A citizen invited me to his
house and treated me well. I there took
tea, which was served by the daughter of
my host."</p></blockquote>

<p>The daily business and special occupations
of a commissary as well
as the incidents of a campaign
life, date from this day for M.
Blanchard. In an army in active
service, the position of a commissary
affords him an opportunity, if he is
so inclined, to carefully observe, if
not military operations, at least the
strange country to which the war has
brought him. After his immediate
duties, he should acquaint himself
with its resources, and have relations
with the population, be they
friendly or otherwise, of every kind.
Hence arises a great variety of impressions
and remarks which we accordingly
find in this journal.</p>

<p>A short time after landing, M.
Blanchard was sent to the assembly
in Boston, to ask the immediate assistance
of the provincial troops in case
of an attack upon Rhode Island by
the English, which they anticipated.
A German dragoon in the American
service, with whom he was obliged to
converse in Latin, acted as his guide.
Boston, with its Presbyterian population
descended from some of Cromwell's
followers who had emigrated
to America, was still the active head
of the revolution. M. Blanchard
met there some of the remarkable
men connected with it: Dr. Cooper,
John Adams, and Hancock. He describes
the general appearance of the
city which reminded him of Angers.
He met among the inhabitants of
Boston two who bore the same name
as himself; they were the descendants
of refugees driven from this country
by the revocation of the edict of
Nantes, and who in less than a century
had become completely American.</p>

<p>The expedition to America lasted
from July, 1780, to December, 1782,
a period of two years and a half,
and during that interval it seems to
us that comparatively little was done.
Certainly in those days they did not
move so fast as now, and no one appeared
to be in a hurry; it was reserved
for our revolution to give a
quickening impulse to the world.</p>

<p>The corps of five thousand men
under General Rochambeau had, when
they landed in America, no less than
eight hundred on the sick-list; a
frightful number, being nearly one
fifth of the effective force. The length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">[793]</a></span>
of the voyage, and the bad quality
of the food on shipboard, were the
causes of this. We learn, however,
from another statement of a similar
kind made by M. Blanchard, that
such a proportion on the sick-list after
a sea voyage was by no means unusual.
The first thing to be done was
to restore the health of the army, and
for that purpose it remained a whole
year inactive at Rhode Island, if we
except the sailing of an expedition
with a party on board intended for
land-service, which was the occasion
of a naval engagement in Chesapeake
Bay. Finally the army moved from
its quarters to effect a junction with
Washington and La Fayette, and, supported
by the flotilla of M. de Grasse,
commander of the squadron, who
landed an additional body of three
thousand men, they proceeded in concert
to invest Yorktown, where Cornwallis,
the English commander, was
besieged, and not long after was forced
to capitulate.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The small French
army passed its second winter in America,
in the State of Virginia, in the
vicinity of Yorktown. In 1782, it
returned northward, threatened New
York, the last place of which the
English held possession, and reÃ«mbarked
at the close of 1782.</p>

<p>Such is the framework to the descriptive
reminiscences of M. Blanchard.
Those two long marches from
north to south, and again from south
to north, gave him particular facilities
for observing the country. Sometimes
with the army, oftener alone,
and going in advance to make preparations
for the sick and the commissariat
of the army&mdash;a double duty
with which he was charged&mdash;he visited
the chief cities of the United
States, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Hartford,
Fredericksburg, Williamsburg,
Wilmington, Alexandria, Providence,
etc. Philadelphia, then the seat of Congress,
counted at that time thirty-five
thousand inhabitants; it has now seven
hundred thousand. Every village,
every station passed through, is recorded
and described by M. Blanchard;
frequently they are but the
small beginnings of what are now
great and flourishing cities. These
pictures of other times extracted from
the note-book of a French officer,
the rude attempts at agriculture, improvements
then in their infancy, the
plantations, as they then existed, and
roads and public works just laid out
but incomplete, present the contrast
of what existed then with what is to
be seen to-day, and give us an idea
of the immense progress that has
been made in the interval. There is
also for the American reader a particular
interest attached to the names
given of several families with whom
he merely lodged, or whose hospitality
was pressed upon him, and whose
great-grandchildren perhaps still reside
in the same places.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> When our troops
marched on Yorktown, they traversed
that portion of Virginia so often
the scene of conflict in the late
civil war; and in this recital, which
seems to treat of times and events
long since gone by, we meet with
many names of localities common to
both wars. There were, even at this
time, indications of different tendencies
on the part of the populations of
the North and South, and the following
extract from the journal makes
allusion to this in very striking terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The inhabitants of these southern provinces
are very different from those of the
North, who, as I have already said, cultivate
their own lands. In the South, they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[794]</a></span>negro slaves whom they compel to work,
while they themselves lead an idle life,
chiefly occupied with the pleasures of the
table. In general, neither as to morality
nor honesty can they compare with the Americans
of the North, and in some sort the
North and South represent two different
races."</p></blockquote>

<p>Expeditions sent out for provisions,
wood, and forage; transports for the
troops; difficulties arising from want
of roads and bridges, and the depreciation
of American paper money; remarks
on the food, the furniture, the
price of articles, the fuel, (they had
great wood fires,) the quality of the
soil and state of cultivation; frequent
accidental meetings with refugees from
the edict of Nantes, (not far from
New York there was a village built
entirely by refugees from Rochelle,
called New Rochelle, which a number
of our officers went to see;) such
are the usual matters treated of in
his journal, on which in a few words
he frequently throws much light, and
makes his journal interesting to those
who take pleasure in such details.
Agriculture and the aspects of nature
are among the subjects that most occupied
the attention of M. Blanchard:
he does not omit to name the plants
and shrubs, both such as reminded
him of France, and such as were till
then unknown to him. This life of
movement and activity seemed to be
his delight. On one occasion, he explored
a large portion of the forest
to find the most suitable place for
cutting down winter fuel for the army,
and superintended the work himself.
"I love the woods," says he, "I was
there in some sort alone, far from the
world. I rode on horseback, and led
the life of a man who dwelt upon his
own estate." That expression of feeling
recurs more than once in his journal,
and mingles with some natural
observations, like the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To-day, after dinner, while walking as
usual alone in the woods, (not far from Baltimore,)
I saw a humming-bird. I knew
such birds were to be found in North America,
and some had already seen them; but
this was the first I met with. I easily recognized
it from the description given of it.
Its small size, its swiftness on the wing, its
beak, and the brilliancy of its colors are remarkable.
It makes a humming noise with
its wings while flying. At first one might imagine
that he had met the insect called the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demoiselle</i> in some provinces of France. It
is no larger; it has also a peculiarity of
stopping suddenly without beating its wings.
I saw it rest upon a shrub very close to me;
after that, I had the pleasure of observing it
for a long time."</p></blockquote>

<p>All the documents in reference to
the war in America agree in stating
that the relations of our troops with
the army and population of the United
States were excellent, and that the
discipline of the auxiliary corps was
admirable; every one in fact seems
to have carried away the most favorable
impressions of the expedition.
The universal enthusiasm which gave
rise in France to this expedition still
lasted; the Americans were everywhere
popular, and the new ideas
which prepared the way for our revolution
led our countrymen to look
with interest and partiality on institutions,
manners, and characteristics so
different from ours. We find this
bias, so general at the time, in the
journal of M. Blanchard, but still
without leading him into exaggeration,
and with some of those slight
criticisms that a regard to truth
made necessary.</p>

<p>At that period, the American character,
if well examined, foreshadowed
all that it has become since; but the
manners were still very different, and
contrast singularly with those of Americans
of to-day. M. Blanchard,
brought into daily intercourse with
their ancestors, says of them that they
are "slow, distrustful, and wanting in
decision of character." In another
place he speaks of them as spending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[795]</a></span>
a great portion of the day at table,
even in the cities of the North.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As they have little occupation, and seldom
go out during winter, but pass their
days by the fireside, and by the side of
their wives, without reading or any employment,
it is a great distraction, a remedy
against <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>, to eat so frequently."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Oh! we have changed all that,"
will be the answer of the Americans
of 1869.</p>

<p>Their morals were singularly pure,
and it is on that basis that liberty
grew to its present greatness. The
journal speaks of but one woman in
an important city, who was talked
of for her levity of conduct, and she
was a European. Here and there
throughout the journal we find allusion
to young American girls, already
possessed of that liberty and that
queenly dignity, founded on universal
respect, which have continued there
to be the privilege of their sex. Here
are two charming illustrations of the
manners of that period:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"During my stay at Boston, I dined with
a young American lady in whose house M.
de Capellis lodged. We had made the acquaintance
of her sister and brother-in-law
at Newport. It was a singular contrast to
our customs to see a young girl who, at
most, could not have been more than twenty
years of age, lodge and entertain a young
man. I shall surely find an opportunity of
explaining the causes of this singularity."</p></blockquote>

<p>On another occasion, it is the
daughter of the host who comes to
keep company with M. Blanchard in
the room assigned to him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"She remained there a long time; sometimes
we conversed. At other times she
would leave me to attend to my business,
and this without constraint and with a natural
and innocent familiarity."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was the period when our eighteenth
century, disgusted with the
corruption of the court of Louis XV.
and the upper classes, indulged in
dreams of a golden age, and a
morality pure and unaffected. The
Americans seemed to offer the realization
of this day-dream; hence the
success of their cause, and the universal
enthusiasm in their favor throughout
France.</p>

<p>The general morality of a people
who boldly founded a republic in the
face of the old monarchies of Europe,
was naturally to Frenchmen of the
old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rÃ©gime</i> the most interesting spectacle
in the new world. The journal
abounds in this respect with facts
and significant remarks written incidentally
in the course of the narrative.
I shall limit myself to a few
quotations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The inhabitants of these provinces
(those of the North) are in general more
affable and more sprightly than those of
Virginia. When our soldiers come into
camp, they are met by crowds of women
anxious to hear the music, and even to
dance when they find an opportunity, which
sometimes happens. Afterward they return
home to attend to household duties, milk
the cows, and prepare the meal for the family.
During this time the men are at
work cultivating the fields without any distinction
or inequality, all well housed and
well clad. They choose from among themselves
those whom they wish, by reason of
their merit or consideration, to be captains
of the militia or deputies to Congress. At East
Hartford, I was lodged in a very excellent
house furnished with order and good taste.
I had a bed as elegant in appearance as any
to be found in our best country houses in
France. The house belonged to the widow
of a merchant who had two very handsome
and very modest girls; one of these was
affianced to a shoemaker, the owner also of
a very beautiful house. I have often made
this remark, but I cannot help repeating it;
the greatest equality prevails in these Northern
States. All the husbandmen have farms
of their own; there is no one who does not
know how to read and write, and there are
no poor to be met with. This is as it should
be in all the states."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It was in 1782 I made those
reflections. I did not think that ten years
after I should see the same equality established
in France."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">[796]</a></span></p>
<p>M. Blanchard remarks everywhere
this equality in education, and a high
standard of manners accompanied by
dignity and elegant refinement. One
day, having negotiated for the transport
of some wood with a rich proprietor,
a man of position in society,
and brother of the celebrated American
General Green, he saw him afterward
come up driving his own wagons.
He mentions the fact on his
journal that evening, adding this exclamation,
"Such are the customs of
America!"</p>

<p>In general, the towns, villages, and
country houses strike him as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Possessing a something indescribably
becoming that pleases one. Instead of
tapestry, the walls are papered; and the
effect is pleasing to the eye. The houses
are, almost without exception, well-built,
and kept remarkably clean, whether they
chance to belong to a farmer or an artisan,
a merchant or a general. Their education
is pretty nearly the same, so that a mechanic
is often sent as a deputy to the assembly
where no distinction is made; there
are no separate orders. I have already said
that all the inhabitants of the country cultivated
their own fields; they work themselves
on their farms, and drive their cattle.
This kind of life, this pleasing equality, possesses
a charm for every thinking being."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we recognize the language
of the reign of Louis XVI., an echo
of Jean-Jacques and Bernardin de
Saint-Pierre.</p>

<p>We have theorized on equality, and
often lulled ourselves with chimerical
dreams regarding it; but we find that
a hundred years ago the Americans
had practically realized it by adopting
as a basis the participation of all citizens
in the benefits of instruction and
education, and the respect paid to all
honorable labor.</p>

<p>So much for equality. We pass on
to some facts of practical liberty.</p>

<p>While the French corps was passing
through the little town of Crampond,
an American asked a very high
indemnity for some depredations committed
by the troops on his property.
This claim was taken into consideration;
but without waiting for a decision,
the American carried his complaint
before the judge of his district,
who, according to law, could not refuse
to send an officer to arrest the
commander of the French troops.
This officer, in accordance with the
legal custom, put his hand, with many
apologies, however, on the shoulder of
General de Rochambeau, in the presence
of the troops. All the officers
present were indignant, and wished to
interfere; but General de Rochambeau
said he would submit to the
laws of the country; and he was dismissed
on giving bail. This anecdote,
related by Rochambeau himself, and
by La Fayette, in their memoirs, is also
mentioned by M. Blanchard, with the
additional circumstance that he (M.
Blanchard) found himself, a few days
after, quartered on the same officer
of the law to whom the mission of
arresting the French commander-in-chief
had been intrusted.</p>

<p>A Masonic procession is described
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was St. John's day, a great day with
the Free-Masons, and they held a meeting at
Providence. It was announced in the public
papers; for these kinds of societies are
authorized here. I met these Free-Masons
in the streets, formed in ranks and marching
two by two, holding each other by the
hand, all wearing their aprons, and preceded
by men carrying long rods. The one
who closed the procession, and who appeared
to be the chief, had two brothers by
his side, and all three had ribbons round
their necks, as ecclesiastics do when they
wear the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon bleu</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>What conclusion must we draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">[797]</a></span>
from these facts? That it would seem
that republican manners had been anterior
in the United States to the constitution
itself. The laws of Congress
have only ratified, so to speak, that
which already existed.</p>

<p>General Washington frequently appears
in the recital of M. Blanchard,
who sometimes had personal relations
with him. Even at that time, in the eyes
of all who knew him, the commander-in-chief
of the American troops was
a great man. No one doubted that
this judgment of his contemporaries
would be ratified by posterity. At
the close of the first interview of our
generals with Washington, M. Blanchard
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A gracious and noble air, broad and
upright views, the art of making himself beloved&mdash;these
points in his character were
observed by all of us who saw him. It is his
extraordinary ability that has defended the
liberty of America, and if she one day enjoys
freedom, it will be to him she will owe it."</p>

<p>In a note; "I wrote the above in 1780.
The Americans are indebted for their success
to the courage of Washington, to his love for
his country, and to his prudence. He never
committed an error, and was never discouraged.
In the midst of successes as well as in
reverses, he was ever calm and undisturbed,
always self-possessed, and his personal qualities
have kept more soldiers in the American
army, and procured more adherents to
the cause of liberty, than the enactments of
Congress."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is, I think, something to
blame in this judgment, where there
is evidently a tendency to personify a
cause in a single man&mdash;a tendency so
prevalent among us.</p>

<p>An American dinner in the tent of
Washington is thus described:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 29th, (June, 1781,) I mounted
my horse to look at the barracks in which an
American regiment had been quartered during
the winter at Fishkill Landing. My intention
was to establish a hospital there. On
the way I met General Washington, who,
having recognized me, stopped and invited
me to dine with him that day at three o'clock.
I went. There were twenty-five covers laid.
The guests were officers of his army, besides
the lady of the house in which the
general was stopping. We dined in a tent.
The general placed me beside him; one of
the aides-de-camp did the honors. The dinner
was served in the American style, and
every thing was in abundance. There were
vegetables, roast-beef, lamb, chicken, salad,
pudding, and a pie&mdash;a kind of tart very
much in use in England and among the
Americans; and all was served together.
They gave on the same plate, meat, vegetables,
and salad, (which was eaten without
dressing except vinegar.) When dinner
was over, the cloth being removed, Madeira
wine was passed round, and they drank the
health of the King of France, the army, etc.
The general made apologies for the reception
he had given me; to which I replied
that I had enjoyed myself very much in his
company, as I did everywhere in America,
which I liked much better than Corsica,
where I had been for many years. He then
told me that the English papers announced
that the Corsicans were about to rise in rebellion.
I replied that I did not believe it;
that the Corsicans were not dangerous, and
besides, that Paoli was not General Washington.
The countenance of the general
has something grave and serious about it;
but it is never severe. On the contrary, it
is gentle, and usually wears a pleasant smile.
He is affable, and talks in a familiar and
lively manner with his officers. I forgot to
mention that at the beginning of the meal
a clergyman who was present asked a
blessing, and at its close returned thanks.
I knew that General Washington was accustomed
to say grace himself when he had
no clergyman at the table, as is the custom
of the heads of families in America; the
idea being that a general in the midst of his
army is as the father of a family."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is a last quotation, in which
we see the American general at a very
critical period of his career:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 24th and 25th, (August, 1781,)
the troops finished crossing the North River.
The passage was a tedious one, as the river
was wide, and they were obliged to cross it
on boats and rafts, which had been brought
together in great numbers. On the 25th, I
went myself to the place, and saw many
troops cross with their baggage. General
Washington was there. They had arranged
a sort of observatory for him, whence he
superintended every thing with close attention.
He seemed to see in this passage,
in the march of our troops toward Chesapeake
Bay, and in our junction with M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[798]</a></span>
de Grasse&mdash;he seemed, I say, to see the
dawn of a better destiny for America, which,
at that stage of the war, with her resources
exhausted, had need of some great success
to raise her courage and her hopes. He
shook my hand with much emotion when he
quitted us, and crossed the river himself.
It was about two o'clock. He immediately
joined his army, which marched the next
morning.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The event justified his anticipations;
for the taking of Yorktown, after our
junction with M. de Grasse, did much toward
bringing about peace, and the acknowledgment
of American independence."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As for General Rochambeau, wisely
chosen by Louis XVI. himself to
command this expedition undertaken
under such peculiar circumstances,
he made the French character appear
in his own person in the noblest light.
The Americans, before his arrival, imbued
with English prejudices&mdash;prejudices
often justified in the eighteenth
century&mdash;against the light tone and
reputed affectation of our young nobility,
were prepared to find the French
general (as several of them afterward
confessed) a mere courtier, opposed
to their ideas and customs, and
with whom their relations would be
constrained, in consequence of difference
of character. They saw, on the
contrary, a type of our old France,
who seemed formed on the same
model as their own leading men, loving
justice, seeking good, worthy and
dignified.</p>

<p>"He has served well in America,"
wrote our commissary, "and has
given a favorable idea of our nation.
They pictured to themselves a
French fop, and they found a thoughtful
and dignified gentleman. '<i>Your
general is very self-possessed</i>,' said an
American who dined beside me, and
who observed the moderation with
which General Rochambeau responded
to the numerous toasts proposed,
and which were drunk as they went
round by all present. He has given
many other proofs of moderation and
wisdom."</p>

<p>He had also his faults, and they
are related with impartiality: a mistrustful
character, unamiable manners,
and an unpleasant temper, of which
his officers often complained. Nevertheless,
General Rochambeau remains
on the whole a fine specimen of
the old army.</p>

<p>We meet many allusions, also, to
La Fayette:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On that day, (September 17th, 1781, a
short time before the taking of Yorktown,)
and the following days, I was constantly
with M. de La Fayette, who wished to assist
me in the provisioning of the troops. It
would be difficult to find more clearness,
patience, and honesty in the discussion of
business matters. He reminded me of
Scipio Africanus in Spain, equally young
and modest, and with the reputation already
of an able general; for his recent campaign,
in which, with inferior forces, he maintained
himself against Cornwallis, has brought him
much glory, and justly."</p></blockquote>

<p>If America and the Americans of
the war of independence constitute
the chief interest of this journal, whatever
relates to the organization of our
troops at that time, as well as to their
spirit and military customs, is not the
less deserving of attention.</p>

<p>In this "<i>memento</i>" of an expeditionary
army corps, there naturally
appear, in the course of the recital,
the shortcomings of the past, and in
contrast the progress since made&mdash;for
instance, in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">materiel</i> and weapons
of war. It was necessary, at that
time, to erect the baking-houses in the
neighborhood of the encampments;
and when the army advanced, men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[799]</a></span>
were sent to establish them ahead.
But they did not march very rapidly
in those days.</p>

<p>There was a certain want of discipline
among our soldiers, and a carelessness
on this point in the officers,
which shock our modern ideas; and
yet the army corps of General Rochambeau,
which was composed of
picked troops, was cited for its exemplary
conduct at that period.
The Marquis de Custine,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> then colonel
of a regiment, having allowed
himself, in a fit of passion, to make
use of intemperate language toward
one of his officers, the latter committed
suicide. The news spread
at the moment of parade, when M. de
Custine was hooted, insulted, and his
life threatened by his soldiers. "Unless
some officers had interfered, worse
would have happened to him," says M.
Blanchard. It does not appear that
any punishment was inflicted for this
serious insubordination. It would
seem as if a disturbance of this kind
did not cause much uneasiness to the
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>The distinctions between the officers
were less marked than at present.
The military spirit was not then what
it has since become, and, in truth, war
was a less serious matter at that time
than it is now.</p>

<p>We might mention, also, the punishments
of the past, and thus mark the
changes that have since been made.
A French soldier struck an officer
with his sword. He attempted to
kill himself afterward, but was taken,
tried, and condemned to death. What
kind of death? His hand was cut
off, and he was then hanged. Some
years have elapsed since 1789!</p>

<p>These soldiers of Rochambeau are
of our race and blood. They are our
great-grandfathers. Nevertheless, how
widely the French army of that period,
which is so near and so far at
the same time, differs from our present
army in its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</i>, its conduct, and
its habits!</p>

<p>We said in the beginning that the
history of the French intervention
had not been written by any contemporary
historian. If one were to
appear to-day who would treat fully
this subject, hitherto so much neglected,
we should have lost nothing by
the delay. Indeed, after nearly a
century of the greatest changes, the
moment would doubtless be excellent
to treat this important episode of our
military and political history, and compose
a work based on authentic documents,
which would have at each step
the interest of thrilling contrasts. The
author would draw a parallel between
the military organization of the expedition
of 1781 and of one of the
present day of equal importance. The
means of action, the expenses, and
the general way of doing things, the
improvements of every kind, would
be compared, and give rise to curious
and useful observations. But above
all, we would see in this retrospective
view the dawning of a nation which
has since developed to a degree
which has no parallel, when we
consider the shortness of the time.
A century has not yet elapsed, and
these three millions of rebellious
English colonists have become the
forty millions of Americans who hold
so important a place in the world of
to-day. Finally, the author would endeavor
to depict the extraordinary part
assigned to this nation toward whose
foundation we contributed, and of
which we might be truly called the
god-parents. He would show its tendencies,
its work, its future. Has not,
in fact, the birth of the United States,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">[800]</a></span>
even to the dullest mind, become an
historical fact of equal importance
with the French Revolution? In an
important document of recent date,
(the diplomatic circular of M. de La
Valette, of September 16th, 1866,)
appear the following words, which
deserve attention:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While the old populations of this continent,
in their confined territories, increase
with measured slowness, the republic of the
United States may, before a century, number
a hundred millions of men."</p></blockquote>

<p>Some will say that the independence
of the United States was a
necessity, and that it would have been
accomplished without any assistance
from France. In the course of time,
very likely. But if France had not
come forward when she did, with men
and money, we can readily believe
that the new state would have fallen
again, for some time to come, under
the yoke of the mother country. As
a consequence, the development of
this people, which has been owing
largely to the principles of the American
constitution, would have been
greatly retarded, and the United
States would not be to-day at that
point where we now behold her.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is curious to
see the old French monarchy lending
its aid to the birth of a society most
opposed to its principles and traditions.
This arises from the fact that
all unite to aid a cause when its hour
has come. However, Bourbon royalty,
carried away by the national
sentiment, performed then a wise and
generous act of the highest importance,
the remembrance of which will
never be effaced on either side of the
Atlantic.</p>

<h2>THE EMIGRANT.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>"Willy, Willy darlin'! Rise,
agra, rise; day is breakin', and ye've
many a long mile afore ye this mornin'&mdash;and
for many a mornin' after it."</p>

<p>As she spoke the last words the
woman's voice trembled, and she hid
her face in the bed-clothes to stifle
the grief that was welling up in great
sobbing waves from her breaking
heart. As the sound of her voice
broke in upon his slumbers, a man
rose from the bed where he had
thrown himself, half-dressed, a couple
of hours before, and, not yet quite
awakened to consciousness, he looked
around the room in a bewildered way.</p>

<p>Then he sat down on the side of
the bed, and covered his eyes with
his hand, vainly endeavoring to hide
the tears that half-blinded him.</p>

<p>A chair stood near the bedside,
and the wife drew it toward her and
sat down, laying her head upon his
knee. Very softly and tenderly he
stroked the dark hair two or three
times, then, while a great sob convulsed
his frame, he bent his own head
till his lips touched her forehead.
"Willy, Willy, don't you give way,"
she said passionately, looking up at
him with sorrowful eyes; "keep a
brave heart, asthore; it's often ye'll
need it where ye're goin'."</p>

<p>With a desperate effort he checked
his emotion, and smiled sadly, still
tenderly smoothing her hair.</p>

<p>"Shure it's dreamin' I was, Mary,"
he said; "and the strangest dream! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[801]</a></span>
thought I was away in America, and
walkin' in the purtiest greenwood
your heart ever picthured. The birds
were singin' and the daisies growin'
as they wud be in heaven; the sky
was as bright and as blue as our own.
But through the middle of the land
ran a great wide river, and it was between
you and me. I didn't care for
the beauty and greenness, Mary, when
I hadn't you wid me; and although
where you stood wasn't half so purty
a spot as where I was, it seemed the
most beautiful place in the world,
because ye wur there. Ye were longin'
to cross over to me, and the children
pullin' at your gown and pintin' to me
always. Some how, it seemed to me
of a sudden that if I stretched out my
hands to ye, ye might come; and I
did it; and ye came without any fear
of the wather, right through and across
it, and I almost touched Katie with
my hands, and felt her sweet breath
on my cheek. But just as ye would
have set your feet on the ground beside
me, something came between us
like a flash of fire, and ye were gone,
all o' ye, and I held out my hands to
the empty air. And then, thank God!
I heard ye callin' 'Willy, Willy darlin','
and I saw yer own sweet face
bendin' over me as I woke."</p>

<p>The wife put one arm around her
husband's neck as he ceased speaking,
and with the other smoothed back
the masses of wavy brown hair that
fell over his forehead, while she said
in tones scarcely audible through her
tears, "It's nothin', nothin', alanna;
shure it's a sin to mind dreams at
all; and ye know that it's often when
we're throubled, we carry the throuble
wid us into our sleep. It was all owin'
to the talk we had before ye lay down
of the weary, weary way ye were goin',
and leavin' us behind. But we won't
feel the time passin' till we'll be together
again, and we'll all be as happy
as the day is long. 'As happy as
a queen;' do ye mind it, Willy, the
song ye wur so fond of hearin' me
sing when I was a colleen and you
the blithest boy in the three parishes?"</p>

<p>"Do I mind it, <i>acushla</i>&mdash;do I mind
it? Ah! well as I mind the merry
voice, and the bright eye, and the light
step that are gone for ever. God is
good, Mary, God is good; but English
tyrants are cruel, and Irish hearts
are their meat and dhrink."</p>

<p>"God <em>is</em> good to us, Willie; better
than we deserve. He's leadin' us to
himself by hard and bitter ways; but
he loves his own. He's takin' you to
a land of plenty, where there'll be no
hard landlords nor tithe proctors to
make yer blood boil and yer eyes
flash, and me and the little ones'll
soon follow."</p>

<p>By this time two little girls had
crept from a bed at the foot of the
larger one; tiny things, scarcely more
than babies, either of them, and they
stood looking wonderingly up into
the faces of their father and mother.</p>

<p>The elder of the two, dark-eyed
and black-haired like her mother,
seemed, as she nestled close to her
parents, to take in some of the sorrow
of the situation; but the younger, a
beautiful blue-eyed, fair-haired little
creature, buried her curly head in
the bed-clothes, and began to play
"peep" with all her heart.</p>

<p>"May be I'm foolish, Mary," said
her husband as he watched the playful
child, "and it's ashamed I ought
to be, breakin' down when you're so
brave; but you'll have the little ones
to comfort ye, and I'll be all alone."</p>

<p>Then with an effort he arose, and
busied himself in completing the arrangements
of his dress, while his wife
placed breakfast on the table. It was
a very poor and scantily furnished
room in which the little family sat
down to take their last meal together,
but it was exquisitely clean and neat.
They had known comfort and prosperity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[802]</a></span>
and even in their poverty could
be seen the traces of better days.</p>

<p>When William Leyden married
Mary Sullivan, "the prettiest and
sweetest girl in the village," they were
unanimously voted the handsomest
couple that ever left the parish church
as man and wife. All the world
seemed bright before them; they had
youth, health, and strength, and sorrow
and pain seemed things afar off
from them then; and they loved one
another. Smile, cynic! as cynics do&mdash;but
love is the elixir of life, and without
it any life is poor and incomplete.</p>

<p>For a time&mdash;a sweet, short, happy
time&mdash;all went well. Then misfortunes
began to gather, one by one.</p>

<p>First the crops failed, the cows died,
and Leyden fell ill of a fever, and lay
helpless for many months. Little by
little their savings dwindled into insignificance,
and to crown all, the landlord
gave them notice to vacate their
farm, for which he had been offered
a higher rent.</p>

<p>There was but one hope and prospect
for the future. Through many a
sorrowful day and weary night the husband
and wife endeavored to combat
the alternative, but at last they could
no longer deny that the only hope
for days to come lay in a present
parting.</p>

<p>So it had come to pass that Leyden
was starting for America, leaving his
wife and children partly to the care
of a well-to-do brother of the former,
partly to the resources she might be
able to draw from fine sewing and
embroidery, in both of which she was
very skilful. Our story opens on the
morning of his departure.</p>

<p>It did not take the sorrowful couple
many minutes to finish their morning
meal. As the hour for parting
approached, each strove to assume a
semblance of cheerfulness before the
other, while each read in the other's
eyes the sad denial.</p>

<p>Soon kind-hearted neighbors dropped
in, one by one, to wish the traveller
God-speed, and to take a sorrowful
leave of the friend from whom
poverty and misfortune had not estranged
his more prosperous neighbors.
For it is in adversity that the
fidelity of the Irish character manifests
itself, and proves by what deep
and enduring ties heart clings to
heart.</p>

<p>It was not long before the car that
was to convey Leyden to the next
town came rolling along the road.
As he heard the sound of the wheels,
he turned from the fire-place where
he had been standing, and motioned
to a young fellow near him to carry
out the heavily-strapped box that
contained all a thoughtful though
straitened love could provide for his
comfort.</p>

<p>As though respectful of their grief,
the neighbors passed from the room
and the husband and wife were left
alone.</p>

<p>Very quickly but tenderly the
man lifted each of the children from
the floor, and kissed them several
times.</p>

<p>Then he turned to where his wife
stood, close to him, yet not touching
him, as though she felt that a nearer
presence would destroy her well-assumed
calmness. He looked at her
for an instant yearningly, then held
her away from him for another, while
she buried her face in her hands;
then with a convulsive sob he flung
both strong arms around her, and they
wept together.</p>

<p>"God and his blessed mother and
the angels guard ye, mavourneen," he
said at last; "guard ye and keep every
breath of evil away till I hold you again.
The great sea seems wider than ever,
darlin', and the comfort and the meetin'
further and further away. You wur
always dear to me, always the dearest;
but I never thought it wud be so hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[803]</a></span>
to part wid ye till now. Mauria, Mauria,
acushla machree."</p>

<p>No answer&mdash;no wail of anguish
from her woman's lips; but her woman's
heart grew cold as death, her
head leaned more heavily upon his
shoulder, the clasp of her arms about
his neck grew tighter, then slowly relapsed;
and placing her gently upon
the bed, with one long, lingering look
he left the house.</p>

<p>When Mary Leyden lifted her aching
head from the pillow, kind, womanly
hands and compassionate voices
were near to soothe and comfort her;
but her husband was far on his lonely
journey.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>Swiftly the emigrant ship cut the
blue waves, boldly her sails wooed
the winds, and hearts that had been
despondent at parting grew hopeful
and buoyant as they neared the promised
land.</p>

<p>Port at last; and, with a party
of his countrymen, William Leyden
sought the far West, and before many
months had elapsed, the letters he
dispatched to the loved ones at home
contained not only assurance of his
good fortune, but substantial tokens
of the fact; and Mary wrote cheerfully
and hopefully, ever looking forward
to the time when they would be reunited.</p>

<p>For two years our brave Irishman
struggled and toiled. Sometimes his
heart would almost fail him when he
thought of the ocean that intervened
between him and his dearest treasures;
but these sad thoughts were not familiar
visitants, for unusual good fortune
had attended his efforts. By the end
of the second year he had cleared and
planted several acres of rich, fruitful
land, and the first flush of autumn
saw the completion of as neat and
compact a little dwelling as ever western
pioneer could claim. Then went
"home" the last letter, glowing with
hope and promise, and sending wherewith
to defray the expenses of wife
and children, who were at length
to rejoin him in the land where he
had toiled for them so hard and so patiently.</p>

<p>"My heart is so light," Mary wrote
to him; "my heart is so light that I
can hardly feel myself walkin'; it seems
to be flyin' I am all the time. And
when I think of how soon I'll be near
you, of how short the time till ye'll be
foldin' yer arms about me, many and
many's the time I'm cryin' for joy.
Was there ever a happier woman?
And Katie and Mamie haven't forgotten
a line o' your face or a tone of
your voice; ye'll not know them, Willy,
they've grown so tall. My tears
are all happy ones now, alanna; my
prayers are all thankful ones, asthore
machree."</p>

<p>How often Leyden read and reread
this letter, its torn and ragged
appearance might indicate, and as the
intervening days sped by, each seemed
longer than the last. Mary and
the children were to come direct from
New York with a party who also expected
to meet friends in the West,
and he felt quite easy as to their safety
and companionship. But ever and
anon, as the time drew near, he half
reproached himself that he had not
gone to meet them, a pleasure he had
only foregone on account of his scanty
resources.</p>

<p>At last they were in St. Louis&mdash;they
would be with him in three days.
How wearily those days dragged on.
But the beautiful October morning
dawned at last; a soft mist hung over
the tree-tops, and the balmy breath
of the Indian summer threw a subtle
perfume over the thick forest and its
wide stretch of meadow-land beyond.</p>

<p>It was fifteen miles to the nearest
town, and fifteen more to the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[804]</a></span>
station. The earliest dawn saw William
Leyden up and impatient to be
away. In company with one of his
old neighbors, he took his place in the
rough wagon that was to figure so
prominently in the "hauling home."
About eight o'clock they reached their
first stopping-place, where Leyden's
friend had some little business to
transact that would detain him a short
time in the town.</p>

<p>Not caring to accompany him, too
restless to sit still in the public room
of the tavern, the impatient husband
and father wandered into the spacious
yard behind the house. A young girl
stood washing and wringing out
clothes near the kitchen door. Mechanically
he took in every feature of
the place; the long, low bench over
which she leaned; her happy, careless
face; her bare, red arms and wrinkled
hands; the white flutter of garments
from the loosened line; the green grass,
where here and there others lay
bleaching; the broken pump and disused
trough; two or three calves
munching the scattered herbage; in
the distance a wide, illimitable stretch
of prairie.</p>

<p>How well he remembered it all
afterward!</p>

<p>As he stood watching her, the girl
nodded smilingly and went on with
her work. After a while she began to
hum softly to herself. Leyden caught
the sound, and listened. "What tune
is that?" he asked eagerly. "Sing it
loud."</p>

<p>"Shure I dunno," the girl answered.
"I heard my grandmother sing it
many's the time in the ould counthry,
and I do be croonin' it over to mysel'
sometimes here at my washin'."</p>

<p>"Have you the words of it a', colleen?"
he inquired. "I'd give a dale
to hear them again. 'Tis the song
my own Mary likes best; and, thanks
be to God! I'll hear her own sweet
voice singin' it shortly. It's to meet
her this mornin' I'm goin'&mdash;her and
the childer, all the way from Ireland;
but if ye have the words of it and will
sing it for me, I'd like to hear it."</p>

<p>"Ayeh but you're the happy man,
this day!" she replied. "I'm not much
of a hand at singin', but I believe I
have all the words, and I'm shure
ye're welcome to hear them as well
as I can give them."</p>

<p>With a preparatory cough and a
modest little blush, the girl began in a
timid voice the familiar melody. It
was a sad, dirge-like air, as are so
many of that sad, suffering land,
"whose children weep in chains."</p>

<p>And yet it was not in itself a mournful
song. Ever and anon the glad
refrain broke forth exultingly and joyously
from the monotone of the preceding
notes.</p>

<p>Simple as were the words, they found
a welcome in the heart of the listener;
and unpretending as they seem written,
they may find a like responsive echo
in the heart of the Irish reader.</p>

<p>William Leyden wiped the tears
from his eyes as the girl concluded
the song.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear. God bless you,"
he said, "for singin' me Mary's song!"</p>

<p>The next moment he saw his friend
advancing toward him, and in another
they had resumed their journey.</p>

<p>Not much was said on either side
as they rode along. At intervals our
hero's heart gave a great throb, almost
painful in its joy, and once in a while
he made some casual remark; but
that was all.</p>

<p>As they neared their destination,
they noticed an unusual stir and excitement
in the vicinity; and as they
approached the depot, they saw knots
of men scattered at intervals, apparently
engaged in discussing some
event that had recently transpired.</p>

<p>"There must have been a fight hereabouts,
Will," said his friend; "but as
every minute will seem an hour to
you now, we'll not stop to ask questions.
The train has been in half an
hour by this time. I wonder if Mary'll
know ye with that great beard?"</p>

<p>Leyden had no time to answer him,
for at that moment a man advanced
from a crowd that blocked up the
road in front of them, and, checking
the horses, said quickly, "Can't drive
any further. Way up yonder blocked
with the wreck."</p>

<p>"What wreck?" exclaimed both
men with a single voice. "Haven't
heard about it?" he replied. "Down-train,
this morning, met the up-train,
behind time&mdash;collision&mdash;cars smashed&mdash;fifty
or sixty killed&mdash;as many
wounded&mdash;terrible accident&mdash;no fault
anywhere, of course."</p>

<p>But he checked his volubility at
sight of the white face that confronted
him, and the strong, convulsive
grasp that seized his hand. Then in a
softened tone he said,</p>

<p>"Hope you an't expecting no one;"
and moved back a pace.</p>

<p>There was no answer; for William
Leyden had sprung from the wagon,
dashing like a lunatic through the
group of men on the road-side, and in
an instant had cleared the hundred
yards between him and the station.</p>

<p>The crowd that stood upon the
platform made way for him as he advanced;
for they felt instinctively that
he had come upon a melancholy quest,
and the man whom he had clutched
violently as he asked, "Where are the
dead?" pointed to the inner room,
where lay the mangled corpses of the
victims.</p>

<p>Alas! in a few minutes after he had
stepped across the threshold his eye fell
upon the corpse of a fair-haired little
girl, beside whom, one arm half thrown
across the child, a woman lay, with
a calm, holy expression on her dead
face. Just at her crushed feet, which
some merciful hand had covered, the
body of another child was lying; but
the black, wavy hair had been singed,
and the white forehead burned and
scarred, and the little hands were
quite disfigured.</p>

<p>And they had left the dear old land
for this! They had borne poverty and
separation, and the weariness of waiting;
through lingering days of anticipation
they had traversed miles
upon miles of dangerous ocean to be
dashed, on the threshold of a new life,
at the portal of realization, into the
pitiless, fathomless abyss of eternity!
Ah! no; rather to be gathered into
the arms of a merciful God&mdash;to be
folded close to his heart, for ever and
ever. Truly his ways are not our
ways, and who can understand them?</p>

<p>In a moment more the husband
and father had sunk upon his knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[806]</a></span>
beside the lifeless group; but no
words came from his lips save "Mauria,
Mauria avourneen, acushla machree."
Then he would pass his hands
caressingly over the ghastly faces,
pressing tenderly and often the little
childish fingers in his own, and kissing
the scarred and disfigured forehead.</p>

<p>He never knew who it was that
bore him away from the dreadful spot;
what hands prepared his loved ones
for the grave, he never knew, and never
asked to know. He only remembered
waking momentarily from a stupor
on that sad night, and seeing the
benevolent face of the priest bending
over him, and hearing something he
was saying about Calvary and the
cross, to which he replied half unconsciously,
but with a feeling as though
there were angels near him, "God's
will be done."</p>

<p class="p2 center">TRANSLATED FROM THE HISTORISCH-POLITISCHE BLATTER.</p>

<h2>NICOLAUS COPERNICUS.</h2>


<p>The material for the biography of
this remarkable man is not very abundant.
More than a century after his
death, Gassendi published a life of
Copernicus in Latin; this life, however,
was compiled from printed sources
only. A German biography, by Westphal,
appeared at Constance in 1822.
In 1856, an anonymous author in Berlin
wrote concerning Copernicus. Besides
these we have essays by L. Prowe.
Last of all, a life of Copernicus has
appeared by Dr. Hipler; of which we
purpose in this article to give a compendium.</p>

<p>There are nineteen folio volumes
among the episcopal archives of
Frauenburg, which contain the remnants
of an uncommonly rich correspondence
by Dantiscus, Bishop of
Ermland, who was for a time the ambassador
of Sigismond of Poland at
the court of Charles V. Rich as this
collection still remains, it is to be regretted
that the greater part of it was
carried off to Sweden by Gustavus
Adolphus and his successors, to be
there divided and scattered.</p>

<p>A portion of the fragments was collected
and returned in 1833, upon a
demand made by the Prussian government;
another portion was subsequently
discovered by Prowe in the library
of the university of Upsal. Through
the mediation of the Prussian minister
of worship, this collection was put at
the disposal of Dr. Hipler. In both
collections, that of Frauenburg and
that of Upsal, very interesting essays
on Copernicus are contained. Of
these Dr. Hipler has made good use,
and thereby elucidated the history of
the celebrated canon. According to
Hipler's researches, the life of Copernicus
may be summed up as follows:</p>

<p>Nicolaus Copernicus was born on
the 19th of February, 1473, at Thorn.
His father, "Niklas Copernigk," was
a respectable merchant of extensive
business relations. His mother Barbara
was the daughter of Lucas Watzelrode,
who left besides Barbara a
son, also named Lucas, afterward
Bishop of Ermland and the chief patron
of his nephew Copernicus. It is
probable, as Hipler shows, that after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[807]</a></span>
receiving primary instruction in the
excellent schools of his native town,
Copernicus completed his third and
fourth years' course in the high-school
of Kulm. In the autumn of 1491,
we find him matriculated at the university
of Cracow, which was then
famous for the remarkable ability of
its professor of mathematics, Adalbert
Blar, commonly known as Brudjewski.</p>

<p>It was in this university that the
foundations were laid of the subsequent
success of Copernicus in astronomy.
He commented already
on the writings of the great astronomers,
Peurbach and Regiomonban;
and he afterward declared that he
was indebted for the principal part
of his learning to the university
of Cracow; a fact to be attributed,
without doubt, to the superior instructions
of Brudjewski.</p>

<p>At the expiration of four years,
being then twenty-two, he returned to
Prussia, where he obtained from his
uncle, the bishop a canonry at Frauenburg
in 1495. A statute of the chapter
required that every canon who had
not received a degree in theology, jurisprudence,
or medicine, should before
taking rank enter one of the chartered
universities, and there during three
years apply himself without interruption
to one of the three afore-mentioned
branches. Copernicus not being
a graduate, went to Bologna in 1497,
and there gave his attention to law.
His choice of this branch of learning
was determined by the circumstance
of his being a member of the cathedral
chapter, which naturally constituted
the senate or council of the bishop,
who in those days was also a temporal
sovereign. We can easily conceive that
the youthful canon would make special
endeavors to excel in his department,
that he might by the eminence of his
knowledge be able to cast a veil, as it
were, over his great youth. We know
nothing further concerning his legal
studies, but the skill with which as ambassador
of the chapter and administrator
of the diocese he defended, both
orally and by writing, the privileges of
the seignory of Ermland against the
aggressions of the German order clearly
proves that he had passed his three
years in the study of law with great
success.</p>

<p>At Bologna, his legal studies did
not hinder him from perfecting his
mathematical and astronomical acquirements.
An efficient aid to him
for this purpose was his intercourse
with the learned Dominican, Maria
of Ferrara. It seems that he first
led Copernicus to doubt the truth of
the system of Ptolemy. It is possible,
also, that through him he became acquainted
with Pythagorean and Platonic
philosophy, and its theory regarding
the motion of the earth. In
1499, Copernicus was still sojourning
at Bologna, where he experienced
the common misfortune of students,
financial embarrassment. The maintenance
of his brother Andrew, who
had followed him to that city, occasioned
him considerable expense; but
he was finally rescued from his troubles
by his uncle, the bishop. In
1500, we find him at Rome lecturing
on mathematics before a large assembly
of hearers. He returned to Frauenburg
with the resolution, however,
to revisit Italy at any cost. It was a
cause of annoyance to him, as he
himself discloses, that the motion of
the great mechanism of the world,
devised for our sake by the greatest
and most orderly of artificers, had
not been more clearly and satisfactorily
explained. That he might enter
upon this investigation with a greater
prospect of success, he determined to
learn Greek also; for the acquisition
of which, Italy alone at that period
afforded good opportunities. He
therefore, in 1501, applied to the
chapter for another leave of absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[808]</a></span>
for two years. At the same time his
brother Andrew, who had become a
canon, requested permission to enter
upon the three years' course prescribed
by a statute of the chapter.</p>

<p>Copernicus pledged himself, in case
his brother's request was granted, to
apply during his stay in Italy to the
study of medicine also, that he might
afterward act as physician to the chapter.
The chapter had previously numbered
among its members a practical
physician, whose death had left in
their midst a painful void. From this
circumstance it is plain that Copernicus
had not as yet received any of
the higher orders; nor did he subsequently
receive any; for the practice
of medicine, including, as it necessarily
did, dissecting and searing, constituted
an irregularity which debarred
from holy orders.</p>

<p>Moreover, Mauritius, Bishop of
Ermland, wrote in 1531 that his
chapter had but one priest among its
members. Copernicus had probably
received minor orders only; nor does
he mention himself that he ever received
any others.</p>

<p>In 1501, with the consent of the
chapter, he went to Padua, began
the study of medicine, made himself
master of Greek, had frequent intercourse
with Nicolaus Passara, and
Nicolaus Vernia, of the Aristotelian
school of philosophy, and, after graduating
in medicine, returned to Frauenburg
in 1505.</p>

<p>At the episcopal residence of Heilberg
he served as private physician to
his uncle, and took a lively interest
in the extensive projects and undertakings
of that prelate. One of these
projects was the establishment of a
high-school at Elbing. It failed, however,
in consequence of the narrow
prejudices of the people of that town,
who were opposed to having many
strangers in their midst The failure
of this enterprise is much to be regretted;
for without a doubt this institution
would have afforded a fine field
for the intellectual activity of the
great astronomer. His life under these
circumstances continued to be simply
that of a physician and canonist. His
monumental work on the revolutions
of the heavenly bodies progressed in
secret, according as the ailments of
members of the chapter and the lawsuits
of Ermland left him leisure for
such occupation.</p>

<p>In his case, as in the case of so
many others, modesty exhibits itself
as the characteristic of genius and
true greatness. After the death of
his uncle, in 1512, Copernicus returned
to Frauenburg, where the residence
of the canons on the banks of the
Haff, affording an unobstructed view,
presented great facilities for astronomical
observations. Here he continued
to enjoy much popularity as a
physician. It must, however, be admitted
that a prescription and a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">regimen sanitatis</i> which we have
from him show that he possessed but
the limited science of those times.
Still he enjoyed the confidence of the
people. His brother Andrew, who
was afflicted with a species of leprosy,
engaged much of his attention.</p>

<p>From 1512 to 1523, Fabian Tettinger
was Bishop of Ermland. At
his decease, Copernicus was chosen by
the chapter as administrator. When
he had filled this office for nearly one
year, Mauritius Ferber became bishop,
and administered the diocese from
1523 to 1537. This prelate, who also
was an invalid, placed great reliance
on the medical skill of the learned
canon.</p>

<p>After his death, Copernicus was associated
with three others on the list
of candidates for the bishopric. But
Dantiscus, Bishop of Kulm, the same
who has left the valuable manuscripts
for the biography of Copernicus, was
nominated. The canon lived on terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[809]</a></span>
of the closest intimacy with this prelate.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of his administration,
the new bishop was attacked
by a dangerous illness; which, however,
the skill of Copernicus succeeded so
effectually in relieving, that the bishop
was enabled to undertake a long journey
as a special envoy. Copernicus
rendered effective medical assistance
to his friend also, and former classmate,
Tiedemann Giese, who in 1538 had
been appointed Bishop of Kulm.
Tiedemann prevailed on him to dedicate
his work on the revolutions of the
heavenly bodies to Pope Paul III.;
and in return, at the instance of Copernicus,
composed a work, entitled
<cite>Antilogicon</cite>, against the errors of Luther;
a circumstance which is of decisive
significance as regards the religious
views of the great astronomer.
They lived together thirty years on
terms of the most intimate friendship.
Duke Albrecht also summoned him
to KÃ¶nigsberg to the sick-bed of
one of his jurists, notwithstanding
that KÃ¶nigsberg boasted several physicians
of eminence.</p>

<p>In 1539, Joachim Rheticus, then
twenty-six years of age, who had been
for two years associated with Luther
and Melancthon, came from Wittenberg
to Frauenburg to place himself
under the tuition of Copernicus. In
a work which has not been preserved,
he described the impression made on
him by the astronomer. There is, however,
another production from the same
pen, <cite>Rhetici Narratio Prima</cite>, in which
much is said about Copernicus, and
which is, consequently, a valuable
source of information for his biographer.
Rheticus is full of admiration
for his instructor. It was he who superintended
the publication of the latter's
famous work, which appeared at
Nuremberg, in 1542. Rheticus repaired
to that town expressly for this
purpose.</p>

<p>But the last moments of the great
scholar were drawing near. After an
illness of six months, fortified with the
rites of the church, he died on the
24th of May, 1543, yielding up his
spirit to Him "in whom is all happiness
and every good," as he expresses
himself in the preface of his work, the
first printed copy of which was placed
in his hands on the day of his death.</p>

<p>Such is the miniature biography
given by Dr. Hipler of the great reformer
of astronomy. We would gladly
have learned more about his political
career, which Hipler only notices
in passing. It is to be hoped that he
will some day present us with a full-sized
portrait of his great countryman.</p>

<p>Dr. Hipler has, however, succeeded
in establishing, on documentary
evidence, drawn from archives, the
chronology of the life of Copernicus,
which rested before on the unsustained
authority of Gassendi. He has,
likewise, exhibited in a clear light,
and with that certainty which results
only from the study of reliable sources,
the education, teachers, friends,
and offices of Copernicus, the origination
of his system, and the attitude
he assumed in regard to the Reformation.</p>

<p>We have seen that his attitude was
decidedly unfriendly. Hence, it naturally
occurred to his biographer to
show how the reformers were affected
toward Copernicus. Protestant writers
generally indulge in the strange
fancy that all the great minds of the
period of the Reformation belong to
their ranks; and it is almost a subject
of surprise that Copernicus escaped
an inscription on the monument raised
to Luther, at Worms. No doubt,
however, at Luther's feet would have
been an uncomfortable place for the
man of whom we read in Luther's
<cite>Table-Talk</cite>: "People gave ear to an
upstart astrologer, who strove to show
that the earth revolves, not the heavens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[810]</a></span>
or the firmament, the sun and
moon.... But such is now the state
of things. Whoever wishes to appear
clever, must devise some new system
which of all systems is, of course, the
very best. This fool wishes to reverse
the entire science of astronomy. But
sacred Scripture tells us that Joshua
commanded the sun to stand still, and
not the earth."</p>

<p>Later on, Melancthon wrote in a
work entitled, <cite>De Initiis DoctrinÃ¦
PhysicÃ¦</cite>: "The eyes are witnesses
that the heavens revolve in the space
of twenty-four hours. But certain men,
either from the love of novelty or to
make a display of their ingenuity,
have concluded that the earth moves,
and they maintain that neither the
eighth sphere nor the sun revolves.
Now, although these clever dreamers
find many ingenious things wherewith
to recreate their minds, it is, nevertheless,
a want of honesty and decency
to assert such absurd notions publicly,
and the example is pernicious. It
is the part of a good mind to accept
the truth as revealed by God, and to
acquiesce in it."</p>

<p>Both reformers condemned the system
of Copernicus, as opposed to the
teaching of the sacred Scriptures.</p>

<p>How differently did Rome deal with
the doctrine of Copernicus! From an
entry made in the <cite>Codex GrÃ¦cus</cite>, CLI.,
in the State Library of Munich, it
appears that as early as 1533, Clement
VII. had the learned Widmanstadt
to explain the system to him in
the gardens of the Vatican, and that
he recompensed Widmanstadt for his
services with the gift of the Greek
work above mentioned. The entry in
the book, setting forth these facts,
was made by the hand of the recipient
of the gift.</p>

<p>Paul III. accepted the dedication
of the work of Copernicus. The sentence
pronounced on Galileo by the
Congregation of the Index was never
ratified by the pope, and was actually
afterward revoked. The Catholic
Church has always ignored that extravagant
notion of inspiration, so
justly censured by Lessing, according
to which the Bible is to be received
as a text-book even of astronomy,
geography, and other natural
sciences.</p>

<p>The importance of the system
of Copernicus cannot be over-rated.
It was a bold and successful
attempt to explain the mechanism
of the world. According to his
theory, the world was no longer to be
considered the centre of the universe,
but merely a wandering planet of an
inferior order. Its <i>rÃ´le</i> in the economy
of the spheres seemed to be that
of the lost sheep which the Good
Shepherd came to find. The system
of Copernicus contained also a caution
against trusting over-much to those
appearances which are made known
to us by the senses, and against attending
to the dead-letter of the Bible
merely. Hence it was calculated to
exert an influence in other departments
of science, as well as in that of
astronomy. At first it met with no
sympathy. The inhabitants of Elbing,
who had refused the university with
which Lucas Watzelrode felt disposed
to present them, were the first to exhibit
a burlesque play directed against
Copernicus. The people of Nuremberg
had a medal struck, whereon
were ironical inscriptions directed
against him. Nevertheless, his discovery
gradually won the recognition
of the intelligent scientific world.</p>

<p>In searching the archives of Ermland,
Dr. Hipler has met with two pictures,
the one of Luther, the other of Copernicus&mdash;both
from the pen of Dantiscus,
the last spiritual superior of the
latter&mdash;between which there exists so
great a contrast that he has thought
it worth while to give them to the
public. As has been already observed,
Dantiscus was at one time the
ambassador of Sigismond of Poland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[811]</a></span>
at the court of Charles V. He had
travelled over nearly one half of the
globe, had been at all the European
courts, and also in Asia and Africa.
He was a great admirer and patron
of literary and scientific accomplishments,
and he corresponded with
many statesmen and men of learning,
among whom were Wicel, Thomas
Cranmer of Canterbury, Melancthon,
CochlÃ¦us, and others. In 1523, happening
to be in the neighborhood of
Wittenberg, a desire to see Luther,
rather inordinate, as he himself acknowledges,
took possession of him.
Luther consented to see him. The
following is Dantiscus's account of
the interview: "We sat down and
entered upon a conversation which
lasted four hours. I found the man
witty, learned, and fluent; but I
also noticed that he uttered scarce
any thing but sarcasm and invectives
against the pope, the emperor,
and several other princes. Were I
to attempt to write it all down, the
day would pass before I would have
done. Luther's countenance resembles
his books. His eyes are sharp,
and sparkle with the weird fire to be
noticed in lunatics. His manner of
speaking is violent, and full of irony
and ridicule. He dresses so as not
to be distinguished from a courtier.
He seems like a first-rate boon companion.
So far as holiness of life is
concerned, which some have attributed
to him, he differs not at all from
the rest of us. Haughtiness and vanity
are very apparent in him; in abusing,
slandering, and ridiculing he observes
no moderation whatever." The
comparison between Luther and Copernicus
which then follows is indeed
very instructive:</p>

<p>"It would be difficult to imagine
a more decided contrast than exists
between these two men, the dates of
whose birth and death differ but by a
few short years. For indeed, to say
nothing of the striking dissimilarity
in talents, disposition, and other particulars,
what could be more unlike
than the character and destiny of the
great revolutions in the sphere of intellect
which were originated by the
gigantic powers of these men? On the
one hand, we behold reason, through
an excessively mystic tendency, enslaved
to a blind faith&mdash;in fact, stifled;
and faith itself, as a consequence, deprived
of its foundation, lifeless and
powerless. On the other hand, we
behold reason in a wisely adjusted
harmony with faith and science, triumphing
over the dead-letter of the
Bible, the deceiving testimony of
sense, and every other illegitimate influence,
and thereby imparting firmness
to faith in the suprasensible, and
in all real authority.</p>

<p>"On the one hand, we perceive the
joyous acclaim with which the Reformation
was at first hailed, and the
general desertion, at the present day,
of the principle of salvation by faith
alone, a principle destructive of all
church organization. On the other
hand, we behold the universal recognition,
at the present time, of the system
of Copernicus, which, at its first
appearance, was assailed with mockery,
and branded with the title of revolutionary."</p>

<p>Dr. Hipler has plainly shown that
Copernicus belongs to the Catholic
ranks. The question now arises, Does
he belong also to Germany? Politically,
the bishopric of Ermland was
in his time under Polish dominion.
Nevertheless, to say nothing of the
quiet, modest, and genial industry
which Copernicus seems to have possessed
as a German inheritance, it is
certain that not only he, but also his
mother, wrote letters in German; and
a Greek inscription in a book belonging
to his library shows that his name
was pronounced KÃ³pernik, with the
German accent. Justly, therefore,
does his statue occupy a place in the
Walhalla of Ludwig I.</p>

<h2>THE CHURCH BEYOND THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.</h2>


<p>The States and territories of the Pacific
coast are, in many respects, "a
land apart" from the rest of the Union.
Separated from the other States
by an immense tract of unsettled territory,
no inconsiderable part of which
must ever continue a desert, as well
as by the great barrier of the Rocky
Mountains, the western slope of that
chain presents to the new-comer an
aspect not less different from the
shores of the Atlantic than the latter
differ from the countries of Europe.
The climate, with its semi-tropical division
of wet and dry seasons, the evidently
volcanic formation of its surface,
the huge mountain chains, with
all their accessories of valleys, precipices,
torrents, and cataracts, which
occupy most of its area, and the
peculiar vegetation that covers its
soil, all wear a foreign appearance to
an Eastern visitor; and the people
themselves, though forming an integral
part of his own nation, are scarcely
less strange to his eyes. Men of
races hardly known on the eastern
side of the Rocky Mountains meet
him at every step; and not only do
the different European and Asiatic
races retain their national customs
and characters much more tenaciously
than the immigrant population of
the Eastern States, but they have very
considerably modified the character
of their American fellow-settlers. The
way in which California, and, to a
considerable degree, Oregon, were settled
was altogether different from the
usual system of colonization which
has added so many States to the
Union, from Ohio to Nebraska, and
from Mississippi and Texas to Minnesota.
The journey to the Pacific
coast before the completion of the
Pacific Railroad involved as complete
a separation from home associations,
and as great a change from early habits,
to an American, as does the voyage
across the Atlantic to the European
immigrant; and at its end he
found himself in a country entirely
different, both physically and socially,
from all that he had been previously
accustomed to. The influence of the
old Spanish settlements, in which for
years was to be found the only established
society of the country, the mixture
of men of all the European races
on a footing of perfect equality in
the pursuit of wealth, and the peculiarly
adventurous and uncertain nature
of mining life, which long formed
the chief employment of the whole
population, all tended to rub off the
new-comers' national peculiarities and
prejudices; and the result has been the
growth of a well-marked national
character among the few hundred
thousand inhabitants of the Pacific
coast.</p>

<p>Amid this cosmopolitan population
the Catholic Church has taken firm
root, and in no other part of the country
does she reckon as large a proportion
of the people within her fold, or
exercise more influence over the public
mind. She had preceded the
march of American enterprise and the
rush of gold-seekers on the shores of
the Pacific; and when the pioneers
of the new population pushed their
way across the continent and descended
the slope of the Sierra Nevada,
they found her missions already established
in California. While the
American Republic was yet a thing
of the future, and the west of the Alleghanies
was still an almost untrodden
wilderness, Catholic priests had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[813]</a></span>
begun to gather into the fold of Peter
the tribes beyond the Rocky Mountains.
In the early half of the eighteenth
century, the Jesuit Reductions
of Lower California were only less famous
than those of Paraguay; and to
the zeal of the Franciscans who succeeded
the Jesuits in 1767, Upper
California owes the introduction of
Christianity and civilization. In 1769,
or a few months more than one hundred
years ago, Father Junipero Lerra,
with a company of his Franciscan
brethren and a few Mexican settlers,
founded the mission of San Diego,
the first settlement made by civilized
men within what is now the State of
California. Before that year, indeed,
although the ports of Monterey and
San Diego were well known to the
Spanish navigators, no European had
ever penetrated into the interior of
California, and even the existence
of the noble bay of San Francisco
was unknown to the civilized world
until it was discovered and named
by the humble friars. The salvation
of souls, the hope of making known
to the Indians the doctrines of Catholicity,
were the motives which inspired
the Franciscans to undertake
a task which had long been deemed
impracticable by the Spanish court in
spite of its anxiety to extend its dominions
to the north of Mexico.
To raise up the despised aborigines
to the dignity of Christian men, to
show them the road to eternal happiness
in another life, and, as a means
to that end, to promote their well-being
in this world, such were the objects
for whose attainment the devoted
missionaries separated themselves
from their native land and the society
of civilized men, to spend their lives
among savages, who often rewarded
their devotion only by shedding
their blood. The Indians of California
are in every respect a much
inferior race to the tribes on the east
of the Rocky Mountains. Many of
them went wholly naked, they had
no towns or villages, and although
the country abounded in game, they
were indifferent hunters, and depended
mainly for subsistence on wild
berries, roots, and grasshoppers. In
tribal organization they were little if
at all superior to the Australian savages,
and of religious worship or morality
they had scarcely an idea. Many
of the southern tribes, especially, were
fierce and warlike, and belonged to a
kindred race to the Apaches, who still
set at defiance all the attempts of the
United States government to dislodge
them from Arizona. Such were the
men from whom the Franciscans undertook
to form a Christian community;
and of their success in so
doing, the history of California for
over sixty years is an irrefragable witness.</p>

<p>In spite of occasional outbreaks of
hostility on the part of the Indians,
and the destruction by them of a mission,
the whole of the region between
the coast range and the ocean, as
far north as the Bay of San Francisco,
was studded with such establishments
before the close of the
century. Fifteen thousand converted
Indians enjoyed under the mild
sway of the Franciscans a degree of
prosperity almost unparalleled in the
history of their race. The missions,
which were eighteen in number, differed
in size and importance, but
were all conducted on the same general
plan. The church and the
community buildings, including the
residence of the fathers, the store-houses
and workshops, formed the
centre of a village of Indian huts, the
inhabitants of which were daily summoned
by the church bells to mass,
as a prelude to their labors, and again
in the evening called back to rest by
the notes of the Angelus. Religious
instruction was given to all on Sundays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[814]</a></span>
and holidays, and to the newly
converted and the children also. At
other times during the day, the men
worked at agricultural labor, or looked
after the cattle belonging to the
mission, and the unmarried women
were employed at spinning, or some
other labor suited to their strength, in
a building specially provided for the
purpose. The fathers, two or more
of whom resided in each Reduction,
were the rulers, the judges, the instructors,
and the directors of work
of their neophytes, who held all property
in common. The white population
was few in number, consisting
mainly of small garrisons at different
posts, intended to hold the wild Indians
in awe, and some families of
settlers who were chiefly engaged
in stock-raising. The military commandant,
who resided at Monterey,
might be regarded as the governor
of the country; but the fathers and
their converts were entirely exempt
from his jurisdiction, and were independent
of all authority subordinate to
the Spanish crown. The mission farms
usually sufficed for the support of their
inhabitants, but the external expenses
of the communities were defrayed by
a subsidy from the Spanish government
and the "pious fund" of Spain,
an association very similar to the Society
for the Propagation of the Faith.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of California
down to the end of the Spanish rule;
and during the whole of that period,
and for several years afterward, the
missions continued to grow in numbers
and prosperity. The payments of the
government subsidy and the remittances
from the pious fund became
indeed very uncertain and irregular
during the struggle of Mexico for independence;
but the industrial condition
of the missions was then such
that they stood no longer in need of
external aid, and indeed they were
able to contribute largely to the support
of the administration of the territory.
The establishment of the Mexican
Republic made for some years
little change in the condition of the
missions of California, and the services
rendered by the fathers to civilization
were more than once acknowledged by
the Mexican Congress. But the mission
property was too tempting a bait
to the needy revolutionists who disputed
for supreme power in that ill-starred
country. In 1833, a decree of Congress
deprived the Franciscans of all
authority over the missions, and placed
their property in the hands of lay administrators.
The Indians were to
receive certain portions of land, and
some stock individually, and the rest
was to be applied to the use of the
state. The results were such as might
be expected from the history of similar
confiscation in foreign lands. The
fruits of sixty years' patient toil were
wasted during a few years of riotous
plundering, in the name of state administration;
the cattle belonging to
the missions were stolen or killed; the
churches and public works allowed to
fall into ruin; the cultivation of the soil
neglected; and the unfortunate Indians,
deprived of their protectors, and
handed over to the tender mercies of
"liberal" officials, wandered away in
thousands from their abodes, and either
perished or relapsed into barbarism.
The population of the missions in nine
years dwindled from upward of thirty
to little over four thousand Indians;
and when their property was sold at
auction in 1845, its value had fallen
from several millions to a mere nothing.
The native Spanish Californians,
who clearly saw the fatal results of
the overthrow of the missions to the
prosperity of the country, made several
attempts to restore them to their
former condition, but in vain. The
constant revolutions of which Mexico
was the theatre effectually prevented
such a restoration, and the fate of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[815]</a></span>
Indians was sealed by the political
changes which shortly afterward
threw the country into the hands of
another race and another government.
Under the American <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rÃ©gime</i> they
have dwindled to less than one tenth
of their former numbers, and, with the
exception of a certain number of the
converts of the Franciscans, who
have adopted partially the usages of
civilized life, and become amalgamated
with the Spanish population, the
whole race seems doomed to disappear
from the land.</p>

<p>Serious, however, as was the blow
which the church received from the
overthrow of the Franciscan missions,
she did not abandon her hold upon
California. From the date of Father
Lerra's arrival in the country, a small
stream of Spanish or Mexican immigration
had been flowing into it,
and building up its "pueblos" near,
but altogether distinct from, the mission
establishments. The separation
of the races was one of the points
jealously attended to by the Franciscans,
as essential to the success of
their civilizing efforts among the Indians;
and the Indian churches and
Indian cemeteries, which still remain
in several of the missions, at a short
distance from the Spanish churches
and Spanish burying-grounds, show
how far this policy was carried out.
The experience of centuries of mission
work had taught the Franciscans
that free intercourse between a civilized
and an uncivilized race invariably
leads to the demoralization of
both, and much of their success must
be ascribed to the care with which
they kept their neophytes apart from
the white settlements. The latter, at
the time of the secularization, contained
a population of some five or
six thousand, and, including the half-civilized
Indians who still remained
around the missions, the whole Catholic
population probably amounted to
fifteen thousand at the epoch of the
American conquest. For the benefit
of this population, after the overthrow
of the missions, the holy see established
in 1840 the diocese of California,
including the peninsula of
Lower California within its boundaries.</p>

<p>Had Upper California continued a
portion of the Mexican republic, there
would have probably been little difference
between its ecclesiastical history
and that of Sonora or Chihuahua;
but the American conquest, and still
more the subsequent discovery of
gold in the Sacramento River, entirely
changed the face of affairs.
The crowd of immigrants that flocked
into the country was so great as
to reduce the original population to
comparative insignificance in a few
months. A single year sufficed to
quadruple the number of inhabitants,
and two to increase it tenfold. The
new population was indeed a strange
one. American it was in its dominant
political elements, but fully one
half of it was made up of natives
of other countries than the United
States. Frenchmen, Spaniards, Italians,
Germans, Scandinavians, Irish,
English, Mexicans, South Americans,
Indians, Kanakas, and Chinese all
poured by thousands into the New
Eldorado, which might with equal
justice be styled the modern Babel.
Seldom has so radical a change taken
place in the population of a country
in so short a time, and the church, if
she did not wish to lose the territory
she had conquered with so much toil,
had to commence her mission work
over again, and under entirely different
circumstances from those under
which the Franciscans had begun the
work. A very large number of the
new-comers were Catholics; but in
the excitement of gold-seeking, the
hold of religion on their minds had
been seriously loosened, and a reckless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[816]</a></span>
disregard of all social and moral
restraint pervaded the whole population.
To restore the sway of religion
over minds that had forgotten it, to
provide priests, churches, schools,
and all the various institutions of
Catholic charity, for thousands of her
own children, and to make known
her doctrines to a still larger number
of those who did not belong to her
fold, such was the task before the
church in California, and to its accomplishment
she addressed herself
almost as soon as the first immigrants
landed in San Francisco.</p>

<p>A frame church, the first in California,
was erected in that city for the
use of the Catholic miners in 1849,
and, as the different "camps" sprang
up through the State, other churches
were rapidly built up in the more important
centres of population. The
following year, a new diocese was
formed of the territory lately acquired
by the United States, and its government
intrusted to the Right Reverend
Bishop (now Archbishop) Allemany,
who was called to that office from
his Dominican convent in Kentucky.
The new bishop lost no time in hastening
to his post, and began his
arduous task with rare wisdom and
energy. The ranks of the secular
clergy were largely recruited from
various countries; the Jesuits, who
had long been engaged in evangelizing
the Indians of Oregon, were installed
in the old mission of Santa
Clara; a branch of the Sisters of Notre
Dame was established in the neighboring
town of San JosÃ©; and the Sisters
of Charity took charge of an
orphan asylum and hospital in San
Francisco.</p>

<p>All this had been done before the
close of 1853, or in the height of
the excitement of the early colonization,
an excitement such as it is hard
for the sober dwellers of more settled
communities to form any idea of.
The population of California resembled
an ill-disciplined army rather
than a well-ordered community; the
immense majority of its members had
neither families, fixed abodes, nor permanent
occupations, and were ready
to rush anywhere at the slightest rumor
of rich "diggings." The mines
were the great centre of attraction to
all, and, as the old ones were worked
out or new ones discovered, the entire
population moved from one part of
the country to another. Towns were
built up only to be abandoned in a
few months, and even San Francisco
itself, in spite of its unrivalled commercial
position, more than once was
nearly deserted by its inhabitants.
Fortunes were made or lost in a few
hours, not merely by a few bold speculators,
but by every class of the
people; and the wild excitements
which now and then cause such commotion
in Wall street, were constantly
paralleled in every mining camp of
California. The sudden acquisition
of fortune was the hope of every
man; and while men were thus uncertain
about what position they
might occupy on the morrow, few
cared to settle down to the routine
of domestic life. Except among the
Spanish Californians, scarcely any families
were to be found in the country,
and the standard of morality was
such as might be expected under the
circumstances. Laws there were, indeed,
but the authorities were utterly
unable to enforce them, and bullies
and duellists settled their quarrels
with arms, even on the streets of San
Francisco, unchecked by police interference.
Murderers and robbers
promenaded the towns unmolested,
and the idea of official honesty, or of
seeking redress for wrongs at the
hands of the law, was deemed too absurd
to be entertained by a sensible
man. Vigilance committees, the last
refuge of society seeking to save itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[817]</a></span>
from destruction, offered almost the
only protection to persons and property
that could be had in many districts.
Bands of desperadoes, such as the
"hounds" in San Francisco, and
Joaquin's gang in the southern counties,
openly set the law at defiance,
and, in the fever of gold-seeking
that pervaded the whole community,
no force could be obtained to
make it respected.</p>

<p>Such was the population of California
when Bishop Allemany commenced
his episcopal career; and the
prospect of making religion flourish
on such a soil was indeed such as
might well dismay a fainter heart.
Nevertheless he addressed himself to
the task, and his toils were not unrewarded.
Gradually but decidedly,
the moral character of California began
to improve, and the more glaring
offences against public decency to
grow rare. The rush of immigrants
slackened in 1852, and something
like settled society began to form
among the older residents. Of
the agents which helped to bring
order out of the social chaos of
"'49," none was more powerful
than the influence of the Catholic
Church. Most of the Protestant
population had thrown off all allegiance
to any sect, and this fact, while
it contributed to make them to a
great extent regardless of the rules of
morality, had at least the good effect
of banishing anti-Catholic prejudices
from their minds. The church and
her institutions were regarded with
much respect by all classes in California,
even at the time when the
Know-Nothing movement was exciting
such a storm of fanaticism in the
Eastern States. Many Americans
had married Catholic wives, or been
long settled among the Spanish Californians;
the history of the Franciscan
missionaries was well known to all,
and their devotedness appreciated by
Catholics and Protestants alike. All
these causes combined to give Catholicity
considerable importance in the
public opinion, and lent immense
strength to her efforts in behalf of
morality and religion. Catholic charities
stood high in the public favor; the
public hospital of San Francisco, after
an experience of official management
which swept away no small portion
of the city property, was intrusted to
the charge of the Sisters of Charity;
Catholic schools for a long time shared
in the public school funds; and
Catholic asylums and orphanages
were liberally aided by the public.
Bishop Allemany was not slow in
taking advantage of this favorable
state of public feeling to provide his
diocese with Catholic institutions.
New churches were erected all over
the State; schools established wherever
it was practicable; and so great progress
made generally that, in less than
three years after his arrival in San
Francisco, it became necessary to
divide his diocese. The southern
counties of the State, comprising most
of the Spanish Californians among its
inhabitants, were formed into the diocese
of Monterey and Los Angeles in
1853. At the same time San Francisco
was raised to the archiepiscopal rank.
The membership of the Protestant
churches of all denominations in the
State was then almost nominal, scarcely
amounting to two per cent of the
population, while the Catholics formed
at least thirty per cent. The public,
as a general rule, regarded the
Catholic Church as <em>the</em> church, and
this feeling to a great extent still prevails.</p>

<p>For some years after the erection
of the diocese of Monterey, there
was little increase in the population
of California; indeed, owing to the
falling off in the yield of the precious
metals, and the discovery of new
mines in the neighboring territories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[818]</a></span>
there was at times a considerable decrease
in its numbers; nevertheless,
the number of Catholics continued
to increase, owing partly to
the large proportion of Irish among
the later immigrants, and partly to
the natural growth of the Catholic
population, which was more settled
than the rest of the community. A
further division of the archdiocese of
San Francisco was found necessary
in 1861. The northern portion of
the State, with the adjoining territories
of Nevada and Utah, was formed
into the Vicariate of Marysville,
which was subsequently raised to the
rank of a bishopric, with its see at
Grass Valley.</p>

<p>Since that period no changes have
been made in the episcopal divisions
of California; but the second order
of the clergy, the Catholic population,
Catholic institutions, and Catholic
churches have continued to grow
in numbers. At present, the proportion
of priests to the whole population
is nearly three times greater in
California than the average for the
whole of the Union, being about one
priest to every three thousand five
hundred inhabitants; while throughout
the United States the average
does not exceed one to ten thousand.
Nevertheless, owing to the extent of
the country over which the population
is scattered, and the very large
proportion of Catholics in it, there is
still a great want of more priests and
churches, and it will doubtless be
some years before it can be adequately
supplied.</p>

<p>In no State of the Union have the
religious orders taken deeper root or
thriven better than in California. The
Franciscans, the Dominicans, the Jesuits,
the Vincentians, the Christian
Brothers, the Sisters of Charity, of
Mercy, of Notre Dame, of the Presentation,
of the Sacred Heart, and
of the order of St. Dominic, all have
establishments within its boundaries.</p>

<p>The Franciscans, as we have seen,
were the pioneers of Christianity in
California, and, in spite of the oppression
of the Mexican government, they
have never abandoned the land. A
number of them continued to attend
to the spiritual wants of the population,
both Spanish and Indian, after
the control of the latter had been
taken from them, and the order has
shared in the growth of the church
since the American conquest. Two
of their former mission establishments
are still in their hands, in the diocese
of Monterey, in which they have also
two schools.</p>

<p>The Vincentians have the only establishment
they possess in California
in the same diocese, where they opened
a college some two and a half
years ago, and have since conducted
it with considerable success. Los
Angeles City also possesses an orphan
asylum and a hospital, under the
management of the Sisters of Charity,
and there are several convents of
nuns in different parts of the diocese.</p>

<p>The Jesuits were the first missionaries
of California, though the tyrannical
suppression of their order, and
the barbarous exile of its members
from the dominions of the king of
Spain, prevented them from extending
their spiritual conquests beyond
the peninsula of Lower California.
It was not until after the American
conquest that they were permitted to
enter Upper California; but as soon
as that event opened the country to
them, their entry was not long delayed.
In 1851, several fathers of
the society, who had been previously
engaged in the Indian missions of
Oregon, arrived in California, and
were put in possession of the old
Franciscan Mission at Santa Clara,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[819]</a></span>
about fifty miles south of San Francisco.
There they founded a college,
which at present ranks perhaps first
among the institutions of learning on
the Pacific coast, and is one of the largest
houses of the order on the American
continent. The crusade against
the monastic orders, which had been
inaugurated in Italy shortly before,
proved highly profitable to California,
as a large number of Italian Jesuits
were thus obtained for Santa Clara.
A second college was subsequently
opened in San Francisco, which has
attained an equal degree of prosperity
with the older academy, and, in addition,
the parishes of Santa Clara
and San JosÃ© are administered by the
priests of the order. Altogether, the
Jesuits number about thirty priests,
and as many, or rather more, lay
brothers in California. In the internal
administration of the order, California
is dependent on the provincial
of Turin in Italy, whence most
of its missionaries came, and has
no connection with the provinces established
in the Eastern States. It
possesses a novitiate of its own at
Santa Clara, and only requires a house
of studies to have all the organization
of a province complete in itself.</p>

<p>The Dominicans are also established
in the archdiocese of San Francisco,
where they have a convent at Benicia
on the Sacramento River, besides furnishing
pastors to several other parishes.
The archbishop himself is a
member of the order, which well
maintains in California its reputation
for learning and strictness of discipline.
Several of the Californian Dominicans,
including the archbishop, are
natives of Spain, but the majority are
Irish or Irish-Americans. The Dominican
nuns also have a convent
and academy at Benicia, which ranks
deservedly high among the educational
institutions of the State; and a free
school in San Francisco, which affords
instruction to several hundred children.</p>

<p>The Christian Brothers are, in point
of time, the newest of the religious
orders in California, having only come
to the State some two years ago, at
the invitation of Archbishop Allemany.
Their system of education is
eminently adapted to the requirements
of her people, as is shown by
the rapid success of their first college,
which already numbers more than
two hundred and twenty resident students.
The marked success which
has so far attended the efforts of the
brothers gives every reason to believe
that they (and it may be added, they
alone) can solve the great problem
of Catholic education in California,
which is, how to provide Catholic
common schools for the children of
the working-classes. Those classes
there, as everywhere else throughout
the Union, form the bulk of the Catholic
population, and desire to procure
for their little ones the advantage
of schooling. If possible, they
wish to obtain it from Catholic sources;
but if this cannot be, they will, there
is ground to fear, avail themselves of
the educational facilities offered by
the State schools, even at the risk of
their children's faith. As the number
of these children must be reckoned
by tens of thousands, the task of providing
them with suitable education
is no easy one; but the object and
spirit of the order instituted by the
venerable De La Salle, and the success
which has attended its system
of parochial schools in Missouri and
other States, give good grounds to
hope that it will prove equal to the
work that lies before it in California,
where the circumstances of the
country are peculiarly favorable to
the growth of Catholic institutions.
Nowhere else has anti-Catholic bigotry
less power in the government,
or is public opinion more favorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[820]</a></span>
to the church; and though the
infidel common-school system finds
strong support in a numerous class,
yet we believe that in no part
of the Union can the battle for religious
education be fought out under
more favorable auspices. The urgent
need that exists for Catholic
schools at present, may be judged of
from the fact that while the different
colleges and boarding-schools under
the management of the Jesuits, Franciscans,
Christian Brothers, and Vincentians,
provide education for about
a thousand boys, the Catholic common
schools throughout the State
contain a number scarcely greater, or
less than a tenth of their due proportion.
Female education is better provided
for in this respect. The Presentation
and Dominican Sisters, and
the Sisters of Charity and Mercy,
have about four thousand pupils in
their free schools in San Francisco, and
there are also several similar establishments
in different parts of the State;
but even these are inadequate to the
wants of the Catholic population,
and in California, as in the Eastern
States, the problem of how to provide
schooling for the children of the poor
is the most serious and difficult one
that the church has to solve.</p>

<p>California, in proportion to its
population, is rich in institutions for
the relief of suffering and distress.
The male and female orphan asylums
in the dioceses of San Francisco,
Grass Valley, and Monterey maintain
about six hundred of these bereaved
little ones. The Sisters of
Mercy and Charity have each a
general hospital under their charge
in San Francisco, where the latter
have also a foundling hospital. They
have also a hospital in Los Angeles,
and the Sisters of Mercy have a
Magdalen asylum in San Francisco.
Altogether, the number of religious,
of both sexes, engaged in works of
instruction or charity in California,
approaches three hundred, and this in
a population of little over half a million.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made
to the variety of races that forms so
peculiar a feature in the Californian
population. It may not be amiss to
devote a few words to each separately,
especially with regard to their relations
with the church.</p>

<p>As the original settlers of the country,
the Spanish element deserves to be
mentioned first, although no longer
occupying the chief place in political
or numerical importance. The Spanish
Californians are mostly descended
from a few families, chiefly Europeans,
who settled in the country in
the palmy days of the missions, and
whose posterity have increased in the
course of a century to a population
of several thousand. The prevalence
of a few family names among them
is quite as remarkable as in certain
districts of Ireland and Scotland,
where a single sept name is borne by
almost all the inhabitants of a parish
or barony; and nearly all the more
wealthy families are connected with
one another by the ties of blood or
marriage. As a general rule, they
have less intermixture of Indian blood
than the southern Mexicans, though
such of the mission Indians as have
survived the overthrow of their protectors
regard themselves as Spaniards,
and are so styled by the rest
of the population. Some of these Indians
occupy respectable positions in
society, and one at least, SeÃ±or Dominguez,
was a member of the convention
which drew up the State constitution
of California. The Spanish
Californians are generally hospitable
and generous, and, though imperfectly
acquainted with the refinements of civilization,
they display much of the old
Spanish politeness in their dealings
with each other and with strangers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[821]</a></span>
They retain the Spanish taste for music
and dancing, and, we are sorry to say,
for bull-fights and games of chance;
in Los Angeles and the other southern
counties, all the scenes of the
life of Leon or Castile may still be
witnessed. Cattle-raising forms their
chief occupation, and in the management
of stock they display a
good deal of skill and energy; but
their inexperience in the ways of modern
life, and their ignorance of American
law, have gradually deprived
them of the ownership of most of
the lands they held at the discovery
of the gold "placers." Many of them
sold their property at ridiculously low
prices, others were deprived of them
by the operation of the land tax,
which was entirely new to their ideas;
while the distaste for settled industry
and the improvident habits engendered
by their former mode of life unfitted
them for competing in other pursuits
with the enterprise of the new-comers.
The generation which has
grown up since the American conquest,
however, displays a much greater
spirit of enterprise than its fathers
have shown, and promises to play a
more important part in the country.
Politically and socially, the Spanish
Californians enjoy a good deal of consideration;
some of them usually occupy
seats in the State Legislature,
and on the judicial bench; the
Spanish language is used as well
as the English in legal documents,
and the acts of the Legislature; and
one of the higher State offices is generally
filled by a Spaniard.</p>

<p>There is also a considerable Spanish-American
population, chiefly Mexicans
and Chilenos, in the Pacific
States. Most of them are engaged
in mining or stock-raising; but a
considerable number are engaged in
business, in which several of them
occupy prominent positions. The
Chilenos are generally possessed of
at least the rudiments of schooling,
and are tolerably well organized for
mutual aid; but the Mexicans, owing
to the political condition of their
country, are much behind them in
both these respects. Altogether, the
population of California of Spanish
origin must number from forty to fifty
thousand.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the Spanish
population are the Portuguese,
who, of late years, have begun to immigrate
to California in considerable
numbers, and now number several
thousands there. The majority of
them are engaged in farming or gardening.
They are, as a class, sober,
industrious, and peaceable. They are
settled principally in the counties
around the Bay of San Francisco,
and very few of them are to be found
in the city itself.</p>

<p>The American population, as it is
customary in California to style the
natives of the other States of the
Union, has been drawn in not very unequal
proportions from the North and
South, and its character partakes of
the peculiarities of both sections, with
a general spirit of recklessness and
profusion that is peculiarly its own.
The public opinion of California is
much more liberal and tolerant than
that of the Eastern States, and it is
rarely indeed that Catholics have to
complain of any open display of offensive
bigotry on the part of any influential
portion of their fellow-citizens.
On one occasion, about a year
ago, a leading evening paper of San
Francisco attempted to raise an anti-Catholic
cry during the excitement of
a political campaign; but the attempt
met with such reprobation from all
parties, that the proprietors found it
expedient to apologize for it in the
course of a day or two as best they
could. The great foe of the church
in California is not Protestantism, but
unbelief; and although the latter is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[822]</a></span>
its nature as full of bitterness against
her as the former, yet its champions
find it necessary to assume liberality,
even if they do not feel it, in obedience
to public sentiment. Some of
the Protestant sects are indeed outspoken
in their bigotry, but their power
is very trifling, as the entire Protestant
church membership does not
amount to five per cent of the population,
and not one sixth of the whole
people comes under the influence of
any Protestant denomination whatsoever.
The number of converts in
California and Oregon is considerable,
including several individuals of high
political and literary eminence, and
there are also many American Catholics,
chiefly from Kentucky, Maryland,
and Missouri, scattered through
the State.</p>

<p>The Irish are the most numerous
of the European nationalities represented
in the Californian population,
and enjoy a much greater degree of
prosperity than their countrymen in
any other State of the Union. A much
larger proportion of their numbers are
engaged in farming than is the case
in the Eastern States, and the advantages
arising from such an employment
of their labor are evident to the dullest
eye. Much of the cultivated land
of the State is in their possession, and
some of them are among its largest
land-owners. The city population
also enjoys a greater degree of comfort
than the same class in New York
or Boston. Three of the savings-banks
of San Francisco, representing
nearly half the capital of the entire
number of such institutions in that
city, are under Irish control, and
Irishmen are also among the most
successful merchants, bankers, and
manufacturers of California. The late
mayor of San Francisco, and an ex-governor
of the State are Irishmen and
Catholics, and three Irish-Americans
in succession have filled the office of
United States senator, one of whom
still represents the State in Washington.
We are not able to give
the precise amount of the Irish population
in California; but, including
the children of Irish parents, it
cannot be less than a fourth of the
whole. It is needless to state that
the immense majority of the Irish in
California are Catholics, and that their
zeal for every thing pertaining to religion
forms a marked contrast to the
indifference of their non-Catholic fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>The Germans come next to the
Irish in importance, probably amounting
to two thirds of their number.
They are more blended with the rest
of the population than in the Eastern
States, and there is only one distinctively
German settlement in California,
namely, the town of Anaheim on
the southern coast. About one fourth
of them are Catholics, but they only
possess one German church in the
state, forming, in this respect, a strong
contrast to their countrymen in the
Mississippi Valley and on the Atlantic
seaboard. Of the non-Catholic Germans,
the Jews form a considerable
and very wealthy portion, and preserve
their distinctive national habits
much more tenaciously than the rest
of their countrymen. The synagogue
Emmanuel in San Francisco is the most
costly and elegant place of worship
on the Pacific coast, while the German
Protestants have scarcely a church
in California, and indeed, few of them
can be regarded as Christians in any
sense.</p>

<p>The French population of California
is very considerable, amounting
to probably from ten to fifteen thousand,
though, as comparatively few
of its members become naturalized, it
is not so easy to estimate its numbers.
In itself it is more completely organized
than any other class of the population,
having its own benevolent societies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[823]</a></span>
hospitals, military companies,
savings-banks, press, and other institutions,
all distinctively French in their
management. The Italians, who are
nearly as numerous as the French,
resemble them in the number of their
national organizations; but they are
not as well managed as those of
the former. The Italians are engaged
chiefly in trade, fishing, and gardening,
in which pursuits they are industrious
and usually prosperous. The
French are engaged in almost every
avocation. The Italians have a national
church in San Francisco, and
the French have a special pastor attached
to one of the parochial churches
of the city for their benefit.</p>

<p>The Sclavonians from Austria are
also a numerous body; they usually
are classed with the Italians, though
possessing several associations of their
own nationality. Nearly one half of
them are schismatics; and the Russian
government has lately established a
schismatic church in San Francisco for
their use and that of the few Russians
residing there. It is even in contemplation
to make that city the residence
of the Bishop of Sitka, who has recently
been transferred along with his flock
to the allegiance of the United States,
but who, nevertheless, still receives his
orders from the Russian synod. It is
a curious example of the way religious
affairs are managed among the
subjects of the czar, that the president
of the Sclavonian Church Society is a
German Lutheran, who fills the office
of Russian consul, and on that account
alone is considered sufficiently qualified
to direct the spiritual concerns of
his fellow-subjects.</p>

<p>The Chinese form a very large, and,
in many respects, the strangest element
in the population of the Pacific
coast. They are spread through all
its States and territories, and, according
to the most reliable accounts,
number at least a hundred thousand.
Few of them have families,
or ever intend to settle permanently
in the country, but after a few
years' toil as servants or laborers they
almost invariably return to China.
The immense majority of them are
pagans or atheists, and they have several
temples or joss-houses in different
cities of California. A few Catholics,
however, are to be found
among them, and a small chapel has
lately been opened in San Francisco
for their special use. The morals of
the pagan Chinese are of the most
licentious kind, and slavery in its worst
form exists among them in spite of the
laws, their ignorance of the language
acting as an effectual bar to their
availing themselves of its safeguards
to personal freedom. As in all other
Chinese settlements, so in California,
they have practically a government
of their own, under the name of companies,
the chief men of which exercise
almost absolute authority over
their countrymen, extending, it is believed,
occasionally to the infliction
of capital punishment. The white laboring
classes are bitterly opposed to
the Chinese, on account of the low
rate of wages for which they work,
and the belief that they are slaves of
the companies; but nevertheless their
numbers are steadily on the increase,
and it is not impossible but they may
eventually become the majority of the
population of the entire Pacific slope.</p>

<p>The greater part of the preceding
remarks are applicable mainly to California
and the adjoining mining territories
of Nevada, Montana, Idaho,
and Arizona, which have been chiefly
settled from it, and whose inhabitants
partake of the character of its people.
The State of Oregon and the adjoining
territory of Washington number a population
of nearly two hundred thousand,
of an entirely different character
from that of California.</p>

<p>While Catholic missionaries were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[824]</a></span>
first settlers in California, the colonization
of Oregon was mainly effected
under the direction of Methodist ministers
and the auspices of the Methodist
Church. Catholic priests, it is
true, had preceded Methodism on its
soil, and the present Archbishop of
Portland and the Vicar-Apostolic of
Vancouver had visited its Indian
tribes in 1838; but the Methodist
colonies, which arrived in the country
a few years later, were deeply imbued
with hatred to Catholicity, and a good
deal of their intolerant spirit still remains
among the people. The Jesuits
have been, indeed, very successful
in converting and civilizing
the Indians; but the white population,
with the exception of a few Canadian
colonies and a not very large
number of Catholics in the city of
Portland and the mining districts of
southern Oregon, is mainly under
Methodist influence. Indeed, so high
did anti-Catholic prejudice run among
the first settlers of Oregon, that a Methodist
conference seriously proposed
to Mr. Lane, the first governor of the
territory, to expel all Catholics from
his jurisdiction by force, a proposition
which it is scarcely needful to say he
indignantly rejected. Of late years,
however, the number of Catholics is
on the increase, and with the greater
facilities for settlement offered by the
lines of railroads now in course of
construction, their numbers will no
doubt grow still faster in the future.
Portland in Oregon is an archiepiscopal
see, and Washington territory is
a separate diocese, so that Catholic
immigrants need not fear the want of
religious aids in spite of the limited
number of their fellow-worshippers in
these northern districts of the Pacific
coast.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, is the past history
and the present state of the church
beyond the Rocky Mountains; and a
Catholic can hardly fail to find in
them the brightest hopes for its future.
Obstacles will have to be encountered,
no doubt; fights be fought and sacrifices
made; but the successes which
Catholicity has already achieved, and
the vantage-ground she now occupies
in California, leave little reason to
doubt of her final triumph. The soil,
fertilized by the sweat and blood of
the Franciscan missionaries, cannot
prove a barren one; and no part of
the Union gives promise of a richer
harvest than that California which a
few years ago was regarded throughout
the world as the chosen abode of
lawlessness and crime.</p>

<h2>PLUTARCH.</h2>


<p>The moral influence which Plutarch
exerts over posterity is of a very
peculiar kind. He has not, like Aristotle,
laid down the law to an entire
world for nearly two thousand years.
He has not been deemed so perfect a
master of style as Virgil or Cicero, who
were the models, first of the Benedictines,
and then of the prose writers
and poets of the humanitarian school.
His reputation pales by the side of the
brilliant fame which the resurrected
Plato enjoyed during the fifteenth
century; and yet he has done what
all these immortals, whose authority
far surpasses in extent and duration
that of his biographies, have failed to
do. Among the revived ancient authors
none has surpassed Plutarch in
inspiring the moderns with the same
keen appreciation of the classic characteristics,
with the same love and enthusiasm
for whatever is really or supposedly
great in antiquity; and none
has therefore contributed so much to
the revelation of what we understand
by the purely human in man's nature.</p>

<p>From the days of Macchiavelli and
Charles V. down to the present, we
rarely fail to meet with the name of
Plutarch among those writers who
have made an abiding impression on
the youthful minds of prominent statesmen
and warriors. In turning over
the leaves of the biographies of our
modern great, we are constantly reminded
of the words which Schiller
puts into the mouth of Carl Moor:
"When I read of the great men in
my Plutarch, I loath our ink-staining
age." This sentiment has found an
echo in every civilized land, and especially
in France.</p>

<p>The first French translation of Plutarch's
Parallels was welcomed by
Montaigne with expressions of the
liveliest joy. "We would have been
swallowed up in ignorance," exclaims
he, (essay ii. 4,) "if this book had
not extricated us from the slough;
thanks to Plutarch, we now dare to
speak and write." Rabelais refreshes
his soul with the <cite>Moralia</cite>. "There
is," writes the translator Amyot to
King Charles IX., "no better work
next to holy writ." The "perennially
young" Plutarch is the "breviary,"
the "conscience" of the century, and
he remains until the beginning of the
most modern time&mdash;as Madame Roland
calls him&mdash;"the pasture of great
souls," and the "fellow-companion of
warriors." CondÃ© had him read out
aloud in his tent, and in the historical
part of the books for a camp library
which Napoleon Bonaparte ordered
from the citoyen J. B. Soy, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">homme
de lettres</i>," March, 1798, Plutarch
stands first, and Tacitus, Thucydides,
and Frederick II. last.</p>

<p>The home of Plutarch's admirers is,
as we have already observed, France.
Like all Latin races, the French delight
to revel in pictures of ancient
greatness; their historical imagination
is governed by fantastic ideals of antiquity,
especially of ancient Rome, and
the fountain from which they drew,
mediately and immediately, their inspiration,
is Plutarch's Lives. Hence
the exaggerated estimate of Plutarch's
historical merits, against which modern
criticism begins to protest with
much vigor, is greatest in that country.
Indeed, the principle upon which
Plutarch has selected his historical
authorities, and the manner in which
he has used them, are decidedly open
to objection. They are not chosen
according to their scientific or critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[827]</a></span>
value, but according to their wealth
of picturesque detail and psychologically
remarkable characteristics. He
follows a leading author, whose name
he usually omits to state, and whose
testimony he only compares with that
of other writers when there is a conflict
of authorities. The text is never
cited. He reproduces the sense, but
with that latitude which is natural to
an imaginative mind endowed in an
unusual degree with the gift of realizing
the past. In the choice of his
subject matter he follows the instincts
of a historical portrait-painter. To
describe campaigns, to analyze great
political changes, is not his province.
His acquaintance with the political
and military systems of the ancient
Greeks and Romans is very superficial,
and he seems to care little for a more
intimate knowledge of them. His
main purpose is not the study of history,
but that of the personal career
of interesting individuals. "It is not
histories we write," Plutarch tells us
himself in his introduction to the life
of Alexander the Great; "but life-pictures;"
and for these, he maintains,
some small trait, some apt expression,
be it only a witticism, is often more
available than the greatest military
deeds, the most bloody victories, or
the most splendid conquests.</p>

<p>In making this distinction, which
Plutarch repeatedly acknowledges to
be a rule with him, he forgets that he
violates the natural connection, inasmuch
as all historical personages are
part and parcel of the time they live
in; he forgets also that, thus treated,
historical characters degenerate into
ordinary mortals. But Plutarch does
not aspire to the dignity of a historian;
he simply claims to "paint souls;" and
those readers who ignore this distinction
have never comprehended him.</p>

<p>Some of the works which Plutarch
was still able to consult are lost, and
we depend, therefore, upon him for
light on certain important periods of
history. This has led many to regard
him as a historical authority, to consider
his biographical narratives as the
main object of his writings, and to
skip the moralizing comparisons of
the parallel biographies which show
that these portraits are to him nothing
more than a means of illustrating his
peculiar ethics by examples. This
point is of great importance; for it
proves the only view from which the
literary character of Plutarch can be
justly estimated.</p>

<p>Not only his narratives, but the
judgments which he bases upon them,
and the views of the world from which
they spring, have left their mark on
posterity, and this to an extent surprising
even to the initiated. And
here it behooves us to exercise still
greater caution, a still greater distrust,
than we entertain for his statements
of fact. Plutarch stands as far removed
from the times of the heroes upon
whom he passes judgment, as we are
from the characters of the Crusades.
The full effects of this remoteness can
only be estimated by those who have
made Plutarch's age and the moral
condition reflected in his non-historical
writings their special study. "Plutarch's
biographies," remarks a French
scholar of this class, "are an explanatory
appendix to his <cite>Moralia</cite>; both
equally reflected a Greek provincialist's
views of the world under the empire;
the views of one who sought to
console himself for the degradation
and emptiness of the present by a romantic
idealization of the real and
imaginary grandeur of a former age."
Plutarch is an out-and-out romancist,
and to this must be mainly ascribed
the influence he wields over a certain
order of minds. The historical errors
which we are so slowly correcting are
due to this discovery. To show how
little Plutarch was fit to play the part
of interpreter to a period which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[828]</a></span>
already become remote antiquity in
his day, we need only cast a single
glance at the times in which he lived.</p>

<p>From Plutarch's own writings we
glean nothing that is authentic in regard
to his life. Rich as they no
doubt are in interesting contributions
to the moral and intellectual history
of his times, they are barren as regards
every thing relating to the author's
biography. In truth, the biographer
of the ancients is himself without a
biography. We know, in the main,
that he was born in ChÃ¦ronea, about
the time of Nero's visit to the Delphic
temple; that he studied at Athens
under the philosopher Ammonius;
that he visited Greece, Egypt, and
Italy as a peripatetic scholar. After
having taught many years at Rome,
he finally returned to his native place
and commenced that prolific literary
activity which he displayed in nearly
all departments of ancient knowledge.
In these labors the indefatigable student
was rather assisted than retarded
by his various public duties, first on
the urban police, then as archon, and
lastly as the high-priest of the Delphic
Apollo.</p>

<p>The story that Plutarch was once
the teacher of Trajan, and that the
latter appointed him governor of Hellas
and Illyricum, first told by Symkellas
and Suidas, then repeated by
John of Salisbury and the scholars
of the Renaissance, is a silly Byzantine
fable. The latter portion of Plutarch's
life, as we learn from his confessions,
passed in a retirement entirely
inconsistent with the Byzantine
story. The world within whose
bounds the archon of ChÃ¦ronea and
priest of Apollo lived was a contracted
one, and only romance could gild
such an existence with the halo of
departed glory.</p>

<p>Plutarch may be said to have done
wonders. At a time when the old
love of country and state had long
died out, he, the philosopher, determinedly
opposed the petty, baneless
cosmopolitanism of his day. In a
world which had long lost its ancient
faith, and in which the Gospel of Christ
had not yet attained the ascendency,
the priest of the Delphic oracle battled
undismayed for the old gods and
against the anarchy of the renegade
schools of philosophy. In both cases
he is, however, himself, and more than
he seems aware or is willing to concede,
tainted by the prevailing scepticism,
and it is this, in consequence,
which colors his own views of the
world with what we call romanticism.</p>

<p>Let us follow Plutarch for a moment
on those two battle-fields of his
polemics, and observe the distinctive
features of the <cite>Moralia</cite>.</p>

<p>The warm appreciation which he
displays for every thing that is great
in humanity or history is surprising
when we remember the incredible
hollowness of the surroundings amidst
which his heroes were drawn, and
the society in which he lived, not as
a soured misanthrope, but as a stirring
official. The petty ChÃ¦ronea
was hardly the place to prepare the
mind for the reception of great
thoughts. The population of the municipality,
though active and bustling,
lived far from the great world. It
had its share of orators, sophists,
lecturers; it had party divisions to
quicken the heart to love and hate;
it had games to excite the passions
and to stimulate ambition. But what
were the questions which the people
quarrelled about with all the readiness
and vehemence proverbial of the Hellenic
race? They were mainly where
the best baths might be found; which
party was most likely to triumph at
the next dog or cock-fight; what kind
of man the new official from Rome,
or the next travelling sophist, would
turn out to be; how such a one had
made his fortune, or how Ismenodora,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[829]</a></span>
the wealthy widow, could have espoused
an obscure man? These were
the principal topics which the ChÃ¦roneans
of Plutarch's day discussed
when they went to sleep at night, and
resumed again on waking in the morning.
And yet how dearly Plutarch
loved this small, petty fatherland!
How happy he appears to be that it
should enjoy the golden peace which
at last fell upon the world after the
empire had put an end to the terrible
civil wars! Under the iron rule of
Rome all provinces once more breathed
freely. Whatever imperialism meant
at the capital, in the provinces it was
still popular; and even under Domitian,
as Suetonius assures us, the moderation
and justice of the CÃ¦sars was
the theme of general praise. In contemporary
Hellas, in the province of
Achaia, the people appreciated these
blessings, though they felt most painfully
the loss of their former power
and renown. Even the monuments of
their ancient glory, which attracted
annually crowds of strangers, became
so many tombstones full of bitter memories,
and the explanations of the
garrulous guides must have sounded
like reproaches in the ears of the degenerate
race.</p>

<p>The policy which imperial Rome
pursued toward the land from which
she had received in the palmy days
of her transition to a more refined
culture the most admired models in
science and art, and from which she
obtained in the following centuries
the best instructors, the most learned
writers, and the most desirable
nurses, was a strange compound of
severe brutality and flattering caresses.
When the great Germanicus, accompanied
by a single lictor, reverentially
entered the sacred precincts of
Athens, and graciously listened to the
vaunts of the rhetoricians on the
splendor and glory of Greece, and
when immediately afterward the brutal
Piso descended on the city like a
thunderbolt to remind the frightened
provincials in a bullying manner that
they were no longer Athenians, but
the sweepings of nations, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conluvies
nationum</i>, Tac. Annal. iii. 54,) then
this people learnt by abrupt changes
how they stood in the regard of the
Romans.</p>

<p>When the Greeks became the subjects
of Rome, they were but too
speedily taught what she meant by
the "liberation of the oppressed."
All the accustomed safeguards of the
law were suspended at one sweep.
No marriage contract, no negotiation,
no purchase, no sale, between city
and city, village and village, was binding
unless ratified by special act of
grace from Rome. All sources of
prosperity, all public and private rights,
passed into Roman hands. Nothing
remained to the Greeks save the memory
of their former prestige, and
the old rivalry between the tribes and
cities, which invariably burst out
afresh whenever the emperor or one
of his lieutenants favored one more
than the other. So humiliating and
painful were the results of this state
of things, that even such a zealous
local patriot as Plutarch advises the
people, in his pocket oracle for embryo
statesmen, to forget the unfortunate
words Marathon, PlatÃ¦a, and
Eurymedon. And yet the same Plutarch
is so thoroughly B&oelig;otian, that
he cannot prevail on himself to forgive
the "father of history" the malicious
candor with which he relates
the bad conduct of the Thebans in
the Persian war.</p>

<p>ChÃ¦ronea, the home of Plutarch,
ranked among the most favored cities
of the empire, being a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">municipium</i>, or
free city, under the protectorate of
Rome, but governed in accordance
with its ancient laws by officers elected
by the people. Plutarch gives us
a very interesting picture of the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[830]</a></span>
administration. His political precepts,
and his treatise on the part which it
behooves an old man to play in the
state, thoroughly enlighten us on all
these points. The municipal officers,
though merely honorary and unsalaried,
were as much an object of contention
as in former days when they
were lucrative. The candidates were
often obliged to make extraordinary
exertions for popular support; they
erected public edifices; endowed
schools and temples; built libraries,
aqueducts, baths; distributed bread,
money, and cakes; got up games and
feasts, and many wealthy men were
thus ruined by their ambition. The
benefits secured by public office were
exemption from local taxation, precedence
at the theatres and games,
the erection of busts, statues, inscriptions,
and pictures; and, after the expiration
of office, perhaps promotion
in the imperial service.</p>

<p>In addition to the expenses incident
to such a canvass, the candidates,
if not of low extraction and mean
spirit, had to give up many prejudices
which must have greatly hurt the
pride of every true Greek. Plutarch
fully explains in his political precepts
what a patriot might expect in those
days on entering the public service.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whatever position," he tells his young
countrymen, "you may attain, never forget
that the time is past when a statesman can
say to himself with Pericles on putting on
the chlamys, Remember that thou presidest
over a free people, over Hellenes, or
Athenians. Rather remember that though
thou hast subjects, thou thyself art a subject.
Thou rulest over a conquered people,
under imperial lieutenants. Thou must
therefore wear thy chlamys modestly; thou
must keep an eye on the judgment seat of
the proconsul, and never lose sight of the
sandals above thy crown. Thou must act
like the player, who assumes the attitudes
prescribed in his part, and, turning his ear
toward the prompter, makes no mien, motion,
or sound but such as he is ordered."</p></blockquote>

<p>Even the officials of this free city
were therefore only puppets, whose
functions presented no temptation to
the ambitious. All that was left to
the local government were the inferior
market and street police, the care of
the local security and order, and a
partial participation in the apportionment
of the imperial taxes. But while
there was nothing to stimulate the
ambition of the ChÃ¦roneans, the system
had a tendency to promote sycophancy.
The subordinate officials
entirely ceased to think and act independently,
and applied to the emperor
in person for directions on the
veriest trifles, especially when the ruler
seemed inclined to encourage this
spirit of subserviency. Such an emperor
was Trajan, admired by Pliny
for his untiring activity, which led
him to meddle with every thing. He
took up his pen to defend the exchange
of two soldiers, to decree the
removal of a dead man's ashes, and
to assign an athlete's reward. Pliny,
his lieutenant, ruled Bithynia like an
automaton. In Prusa, Nicodemia,
Nicea, not a man, not a sesterce,
not a stone, was suffered to change
its place without the imperial sanction.
The selection of a surveyor
was made a question of state. The
emperor seems finally to have found
the work too much for him; for he
writes on one occasion to his lieutenant:
"Thou art on the spot, must
know the situation, and shouldst determine
accordingly." In the correspondence
of these two men can
be traced the corruption which gradually
seized and overwhelmed rulers
and ruled in the Roman empire on
the inclined plane of a rapidly spreading
super-civilization.</p>

<p>It is greatly to the honor of Plutarch
that he condemns this mischievous
tendency. He does not find
fault with it for the political reasons
which would lead us to oppose a paralyzing
centralization, but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[831]</a></span>
sake of the manly dignity, the moral
self-respect, which should never be
forgotten. "Let it suffice," exclaims
he, "that our limbs are fettered; it
is unnecessary to place our necks
also in the halter."</p>

<p>We perceive here in the honest
archon of ChÃ¦ronea still something
of the sturdy spirit of ancient Hellas.
Not in vain had he read the history
of his ancestors; in spite of the unpropitious
times, he still holds what
survives of their virtues worthy of
preservation; and it is gratifying to
find a man of this stamp serving an
ungrateful public, while the conceited
philosophers of his day regarded
politics a contamination. Nor was
it without a good influence upon the
literary labors of Plutarch that he did
not boast, with Lucan, to know "no
state or country," but was content to
contribute his share to a better state
of things. Yet it is nevertheless easy
to see that in such an atmosphere no
state like the one for which Themistocles,
Pericles, and Demosthenes had
worked and striven on the field and
the tribune&mdash;no country like that for
which heroes had fought and bled at
Marathon, Salamis, and PlatÃ¦a&mdash;could
hope to thrive. In this cramped,
commonplace sphere, amidst the
provincial gossip and the petty interests
of such surroundings, the fierce
passions which had once inspired parties,
which in Rome had fired the
hearts of the Gracchi and the other
martyrs of the declining commonwealth,
were altogether impossible.
Here were only the citizens of a small
provincial town, the descendants of
an ancient and highly renowned nobility
but of beggarly presence, the
wards of a subjugated land. The enthusiasm
with which the higher minds
of such an era revelled in the reminiscences
of departed greatness was
perfectly natural; no less natural was
the dim twilight in which its heroes
appeared to eyes so little accustomed
to discriminate. We can understand
why such a profound impression should
have been made by all that was foreign
in the olden times, especially
when the means to analyze, probe,
and comprehend it were wholly wanting.</p>

<p>Plutarch's keen appreciation of all
the qualities in which the ancients
had the advantage over his own contemporaries
reflects much credit upon
him. Yet he is incapable of comprehending
them individually, for there
was nothing to correspond with them
in the world he lived in. His ideas
of state and freedom, of country and
virtue among the ancients, are distorted,
because in his time their meaning
had partly been changed, and
partly been lost. To Plutarch's susceptible
mind, the heroes of Roman
and Grecian history appeared like
the effigies preserved in some ancestral
hall. He experienced, however,
something of the thrill of exultation
which electrified Sallust, when he, a
warm-hearted youth, first tasted the
same sensation; but when he endeavors
to communicate this feeling to
the reader, he succeeds only in demonstrating
his unfitness for the task.
An historian, in our sense of the word,
Plutarch, we know, does not aspire
to be; he claims merely to "paint
souls" and "to teach virtue," but
even herein he fails. His men are
no real personages, no flesh and blood
beings, whom he makes step out
from the frame of tradition, but puppets
gaudily and incongruously arrayed
in all kinds of odds and ends. He
has never produced a single <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i>
portrait, but merely supplied the raw
materials; and these may be even
more valuable than any artistically
finished but misdrawn historical likeness
would have been. This is, however,
all that can be said in the behalf
of Plutarch's creations, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[832]</a></span>
we have followed him to his home
and visited his mental laboratory, we
perceive that it could not well have
been otherwise. It is in this light
that we have to depict to ourselves
Plutarch in the character of the romancist
of the ancient ideal of state
and country. And when, in conclusion,
we regard him further as the
romancist of the ancient faith, he may
be taken for the predecessor of the
apostate Emperor Julian, whom David
Strauss so admirably sketched
twenty years ago as the romancist on
the throne of the CÃ¦sars.</p>

<p>And here also the priest of the
Pythian Apollo was once more compelled
to accommodate himself to
the sad changes of his time. The
priestess still sat on the tripod; the
sacred fumes still rose out of the
earth; the seeress was still beset by
curious questioners, and the fountains
of the oracle still continued to
flow. But how different was the nature
of the questions which the contemporaries
of Plutarch addressed to
the deity! Not war or peace between
nation and nation, not rupture or alliance
between state and state, as in
former days, now demanded its solution.
It was what should be eaten,
drunk, sown, or harvested; what the
deity thought of a nuptial, of the portion
set apart for a son or daughter!
Such were the things that tempted
the curiosity of the oracle-seekers;
and to answer them no longer in
poetry, but in homely prose, had become
the trivial duty of the sanctuary.
And yet the magnificence of
the gifts and endowments had of late
rather increased than fallen off.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Like the trees," exultingly exclaims
Plutarch, "whose vigorous sap shoots forth
continually new sprouts, so grows the Pylum
of Delphi, and extends day by day in the
number of its chapels, consecrated water-fonts,
and assembly halls, which rise in a
splendor unknown for years. Apollo has
saved us from neglect and misery to overwhelm
us with wealth, honors, and splendors;
it is impossible that such a revolution
should have been caused by human agencies
without divine intervention; it is he
who has come to bestow his blessing on the
oracle."</p></blockquote>

<p>But not even Plutarch could disguise
to himself the sad fact that the
worship of the oracle had by no
means kept pace with the progress of
superstitious faith. Still, while the
heathen deities had multiplied to an
extent which led Pliny to declare
that the gods in Olympus outnumbered
the men on earth; while the
number of secret and public sects
steadily increased in the east and
west; while all the abominations of
a misdirected religious instinct in
both worlds united as in one common
sewer at Rome, when Tacitus
said that among the rising sects the
one prospered most which proclaimed
not only a new god, but a new license
for all who were oppressed and
poor; while all this was going on, the
higher classes of society, the flower
of the intellect of the heathen world,
had repudiated the superstitions of
the masses, partly to deny the existence
of the gods, and partly to adopt
strange and exclusive mysteries.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This estrangement from the gods," exclaims
Plutarch, "may be divided into two
streams: the one seeks a bed in those hearts
which resemble a rocky soil, where every
thing of a divine nature is rejected; the
other waters gentle souls like a porous soil
with exactly opposite effects, producing
there an exaggerated and superstitious fear
of the gods."</p></blockquote>

<p>Against both these illusions Plutarch
protests in a whole series of
works, and the manner in which he
does it exhibits the best side of his
character. "It is so sweet," he assures
us, "to believe;" and we also
readily believe him when he describes
the feelings with which he witnesses
the solemnities of divine worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">[833]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"The unbeliever," he says, "sees in
prayer only an unmeaning formula, in sacrifices
only the slaughter of helpless animals;
but the devout feels his soul elevated,
the heart relieved of sorrow and pain."</p></blockquote>

<p>He implores a pious and child-like
reverence for the faith of his forefathers;
it was these gods who have
made Greece great, protected it in
good and evil seasons; and those who
will not pray to them from their inmost
hearts, should at least suffer
others to enjoy their peace of mind
and happy simplicity. They should
imitate the Egyptian priest, who, when
too closely questioned by Herodotus,
placed his finger upon his lips in mysterious
silence. He thinks it shows
little delicacy in the Stoics and Epicureans
to attempt to represent the
gods as merely another name for the
elementary forces. Those who mistake
fire, water, air, etc., for the gods,
accept the sails, ropes, and anchor of
a vessel for the pilot, the wholesome
drug for the physician, and the threads
of the web for the weaver.</p>

<p>"You destroy," says he to the
Epicureans, "the foundations of society;
you murder the holiest instincts
of the human soul." To the Stoics he
says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Why attack what is universally accepted?
why destroy the religious idea which
each people has inherited in the nature of
its gods? You ask, above all things, proofs,
reasons, and explanations? Beware! If
you bring the spirit of doubt to every altar,
nothing will be sacred. Every people has
its own faith. That faith, transmitted for
centuries, must suffice; its very age proves
its divine origin; our duty is to hand it
down to posterity, without stain or change,
pure and unalloyed."</p></blockquote>

<p>But what of Plutarch's own orthodoxy?
It is just what we might have
expected from one who was too intelligent
to believe the ancient myths and
too much of an enthusiast calmly to
test his religious heritage. Socrates
was not remiss in offering up prayers
and sacrifices; no Athenian goddess
could rationally complain of him; he
believed not only in a Daimonion, or
Deity, but (if the Apology be genuine)
also in a Son of God; yet he was an
atheist. Plutarch's piety is no doubt
more enthusiastic in a ratio to his lack
of the Socratian keenness of intellect,
but strictly considered he has no
greater claims to the odor of orthodoxy.
With him also the different
gods resolve themselves into demons,
and it is only in his heart that he
knows the one true God&mdash;a tenet
which has nothing in common with
the cheerful anthropomorphism of
the Hellenic national creed.</p>

<p>In brief, we discover in Plutarch's
character the same inconsistencies
which are peculiar to all men of his
kind. He stands between two eras.
He flies from an aged civilization,
which holds him in the iron bonds
of custom, to new views of a world
which, even imperfect as they are,
involuntarily master his reason, though
they fail to satisfy his imagination and
feelings. From the prose of every-day
life he turns to the memory of
the glories of his nation, and becomes
their chronicler. Repulsed by the
unbelief and degeneracy of his contemporaries,
he seeks consolation in
the poetical fables of the ancient faith,
and becomes thus the panegyrist of
antiquity. He is, however, unable to
reproduce this antiquity in a pure
state. He cannot entirely divest
himself of all sympathy with those
among whom he lives, and remains
more than he will admit the child of
his own day. Hence what he transmits
to us is veiled in that solemn but
indistinct semi-obscurity which we
meet not only in the ancient temples,
but in the heads of the romancists
themselves.</p>

<h2>THE MIRACLE OF ST. FRANCIS.</h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE SPANISH OF FERNAN CABALLERO.</p>


<p>We are not telling a romance, but
relating an occurrence exactly as its
details proceeded from the mouth of
the responsible narrator, who is an ox-driver.
He who takes offence at the
source, the stream, and the receptacle,
that is to say, at the ox-driver, his
story, and the recipient who is going
to set it down in black and white, had
better pass this by; for the thought
that we were going to be read with
prejudice would change the nimble
pen we hold in our hand into an immovable
petrifaction.</p>

<p>In a town of Andalusia that lifts
its white walls under the sky that God
created solely to canopy Spain, from
the heights of DespeÃ±aperros to the
city that Guzman el Bueno defended,
upon an elevation at the end of a
long, solitary street, stands a convent,
abandoned, as they all are, thanks to
the <i>progress</i> of ruin. This convent is
now, more properly than ever before,
the last house of the place. Its massive
portal faces the town, and its
grounds reach back into the country.
In these grounds there were formerly
many palm-trees&mdash;the old people
remember them&mdash;but only two remain,
united like brothers. In this
convent there were formerly many
religious; now but one remains. The
palms lean upon each other; the religious
is supported by the charity of
the faithful. He comes every Tuesday
to say mass in the magnificent
deserted church, which no longer possesses
a bell to call worshippers.</p>

<p>No words can express the sentiments
that are awakened by the sight
of the venerable man, in this vast
temple, offering the august sacrifice
in silence and solitude. One cannot
help fancying that the sacred precinct
is filled with celestial spirits, in the
midst of whom the celebrant only is
visible. The church is of an immense
height, and so peacefully cheerful that
it would seem to have been built
solely to resound to the sublime
hymn of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i>, and the no
less sublime canticle of the <i>Gloria</i>.</p>

<p>The high altar, exquisitely carved
in the most elaborate and lavish style
of adornment, astonishes the sight
with the multitude of flowers, fruits,
garlands, and gilded heads of angels
it displays with a profusion and lustre
which prove that in its execution
neither time nor labor were taken into
account. What use is made of gold
in our day? Or of time? Are they
better employed? He who can show
us that they are, will console us for
the suppression of the convents. Until
it is proved, we shall continue to
mourn that noble choir, those sumptuous
chapels, that splendid tabernacle,
cold and empty as the incredulous
heart.</p>

<p>Incredulity! Grand triumph of the
material over the spiritual, of earth
over heaven; of the apostate angel
over the angel of light!</p>

<p>The small square that separates the
convent from the street which leads
to it is overgrown with grass, and in
it, in their hours of rest, the drivers
let their oxen loose.</p>

<p>Within the inclosure, in place of
stairs, a slight terraced ascent, sustained
at the sides by benches of stone
mason-work, leads to the door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[835]</a></span>
church. On the right is the chapel
of the third order; the path to the left
conducts to the principal entrance to
the convent.</p>

<p>Reader, if you love the things of
our ancient Spain, come hither. Here
the church still stands; here still flourish,
without care, the two palms; here
is still a Franciscan friar who says
mass in the unoccupied temple. Here
are still found ox-drivers who tell
tales, in which things humorous and
pious are mingled with the good faith
and wholesomeness of heart of the
child that plays with the venerated
gray hairs of its parent without a
thought that in doing so it is wanting
in filial respect. But hasten! for all
these things will soon disappear, and
we shall have to mourn over ruins&mdash;ruins
to which the past, in reparation,
will lend all its magic.</p>

<p>The third day of the week shone
pure and gay, ignorant, doubtless, of
the unlucky quality which men attribute
to it, and very far from suspecting
that its enemy&mdash;a foolish saying&mdash;would
fain deprive it of the happiness
of witnessing weddings and
embarkations.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>On a Tuesday, then, that was as
innocent of any hostile disposition as
if it had been a Sunday, the lady who
told us that which we are going to
repeat, walked up the long street of
San Francisco to the vacant convent
to hear the weekly mass in which
God himself would fill the abandoned
temple with his most worthy presence.
She arrived before the priest, and
finding the church closed, sat down
to wait upon one of the benches that
sustain the terrace. The morning
was cool enough to make the sunshine
agreeable. In sight rose the
two palms, like a pair of noble brothers,
bearing together persecution
and slight, without yielding or humiliating
themselves. The oxen lying
down within the inclosure ruminated
measuredly, but with so little motion
that the small birds passing poised
themselves upon their horns. The
efts, gazing at all with their intelligent
eyes, glided along the walls in a garden
of gilly-flowers and rose-colored
caper-blooms. Light clouds, like smoke
from a spotless sacrifice in honor of
the Most High, floated across the
enamel of the sky&mdash;if it is permitted
to compare that with enamel with
which no enamel that was ever made
can compare. It was a morning to
sweeten life, so entirely did it make
one forget the narrow circles in which
we fret our lives away, and in which
living is a weariness.</p>

<p>Two drivers seated themselves upon
the same bench with the lady.</p>

<p>Your Andalusian is never bashful.
The sun may be eclipsed; but, in the
lifetime of God, not the serenity of
an Andalusian. Sultan Haroun Al-raschid
might have spared himself the
trouble of the disguises he employed
when he mingled among his people
without causing them the least diffidence,
if he had ruled in Andalusia.
Not that the people despise or cannot
appreciate superiority; but they know
how to lift the hat without dropping
the head.</p>

<p>Therefore it happened that, although
the lady was one of the principal persons
of the place, and although there
were other benches to sit on, that one
appearing to them the pleasantest, on
that one they sat down, without
thought or care as to whether their
talk would be overheard. In the
northern provinces, where the people
are entirely good, and as stupid as
they are good, they think little and
speak less; but in Andalusia thought
flies, and words follow in chase. These
people can go two days without eating
or sleeping, and be little the worse
for it; but remain two minutes silent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">[836]</a></span>
they cannot. If they have no
one to talk with, they sing.</p>

<p>"Man," said one to the other, "I
can never see that chapel without
thinking of my father, who was a brother
of the third order, and used to
bring me here with him to say the
rosary, which the brothers recited
every night at the Angelus."</p>

<p>"Christian! and what sort of man
must your father have been? There
are no stones out of that quarry nowadays."</p>

<p>"And how should there be? My
father&mdash;heaven rest him!&mdash;used to say
that the guillotine war of the French
upset the cart. Men nowadays
are a pack of idlers, with no more
devotion than that of San Korro, the
patron of drunkards. But to come
back to what I was telling you&mdash;a
thing his worship once told me, that
happened in this very convent.</p>

<p>"All the people of the barrier used
to send to the friars for assistance to
enable them to die in a Christian
fashion. In these times the majority
go to the other world like dogs or
Jews. Every night, therefore, one of
the fathers remained up, so as to be
ready in case his services should be
wanted. Each kept watch in his turn.
One night, when it was the turn of a
priest named Father Mateo, who was
well known and liked in the town,
three men knocked and asked for a
religious to succor a person who was
at the point of death. The porter
informed Father Mateo, who came
down immediately. Hardly was the
door of the convent closed after him,
when they told him that, whether it
pleased him or not, they were going
to bandage his eyes. It pleased him
as much as it would have pleased him
to have his teeth pulled. There was
nothing for it, however, but to drop
his ears; for although he was young,
and as tall as a foremast, with a good
pair of fists to defend himself with,
the others were men of brass, all armed.
Besides, neither could his reverence
neglect his ministry; and only
God knew the intentions of those
who had come for him.</p>

<p>"So he said to himself, 'Rome will
have this matter to look after;' and
let them blindfold him.</p>

<p>"No one can know what streets
they made him walk; into this and
out of that, till they came to a miserable
den, and led him up a flight of
stairs, pushed him into a room, and
locked the door.</p>

<p>"He took off the bandage; it was
as dark as a wolfs mouth, but in the
direction of one corner of the room
he heard a moan.</p>

<p>"'Who is in distress?' asked Father
Mateo.</p>

<p>"'I am, sir,' answered the doleful
voice of a woman; 'these wicked
men are going to kill me as soon as
my peace is made with God.'</p>

<p>"'This is an iniquity!'</p>

<p>"'Father, by the love of the Blessed
Mother, by the dear blood of
Christ, by the breasts that fed you,
save me!'</p>

<p>"'How can I save thee, daughter?
What can I do against three men that
are armed?'</p>

<p>"'Untie me, in the first place,' said
the unhappy woman.</p>

<p>"Father Mateo begun to feel about,
and, as God vouchsafed him deftness,
to undo the knots of the cords that
bound the poor creature's hands and
feet; but they were hard, he could
not see, and time flew as if a bull
had been after it.</p>

<p>"The men were knocking at the
door. 'Haven't you got through, father?'
asked one of them.</p>

<p>"'Ea! don't be in a hurry!' said
the father, who, though his will was
good enough, could hit upon no
means of saving the woman, who
was trembling like a drop of quicksilver,
and weeping like a fountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_837" id="Page_837">[837]</a></span></p>

<p>"'What are we to do?' said the
poor, perplexed man.</p>

<p>"A woman will think of an artifice
if she has one foot in the grave, and
it entered into this one's head to hide
herself under Father Mateo's cloak.
I have told you that the father was a
man who couldn't stand in that door.
'I would prefer another means,' said
his reverence; 'but, as there is no
other, we must take this, and let the
sun rise in Antequera.'<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>"He stationed himself at the door
with the woman under his cloak.</p>

<p>"'Have you ended, father?' asked
the villains.</p>

<p>"'I have ended,' answered Father
Mateo, with as calm a voice as he
could command.</p>

<p>"'Do not forsake me, sir,' moaned
the poor woman, more dead than
alive.</p>

<p>"'Hush! Commend yourself to our
Lord of the forsaken ones, and his
will be done.'</p>

<p>"'Come,' said the men, 'be quick;
we must blindfold you again.' And
they tied on the bandage, locked the
door, and all three descended into
the street with the father in custody,
for fear that he might take off the
blind and know the place.</p>

<p>"They turned and turned again,
as before, till they came to the street
of San Francisco; then the rascals
took to their heels, and disappeared
so quickly that you would have
thought they had been spirited away.</p>

<p>"The minute they were out of
sight, Father Mateo said to the woman,
'Now, daughter, scatter dust,
and find a hiding-place. No; don't
thank me, but God, who has saved
you; and don't stop; for when those
brigands find the bird flown, they will
come back and perhaps overtake me.'</p>

<p>"The woman ran, and the father
in three strides planted himself inside
of his convent.</p>

<p>"He went right away to the cell
of the father guardian and told him
all that had happened, adding that
the men would surely come to the
convent in search of him.</p>

<p>"The words were hardly out of his
mouth when they heard a knocking
at the door. The guardian went
down and presented himself. 'Can
I serve you in any thing, gentlemen?'
he asked.</p>

<p>"'We have come,' answered one,
'for Father Mateo, who was out just
now confessing a woman.'</p>

<p>"'That cannot be, for Father Mateo
has confessed no woman this
night.'</p>

<p>"'How! he has not, when we
have proof that he brought her here?'</p>

<p>"'What do you mean, you blackguards?
brought a woman into the
convent! So this is the way you
take to injure Father Mateo's reputation,
and cast scandal upon our
order!'</p>

<p>"'No, sir, we did not say it with
that intention; but&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'But what?' asked the guardian,
very indignant. 'What honorable motive
could he have had in bringing a
woman here at night?'</p>

<p>"The men looked at each other.</p>

<p>"'Didn't I tell you,' grumbled
one, 'that the thing wasn't natural,
but miraculous?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, yes,' said another; 'this is
the doing of God or the devil&mdash;and
not of the devil, for he wouldn't interfere
to hinder his own work.'</p>

<p>"'In God's name go, evil tongues!'
thundered the guardian; 'and take
heed how you approach convents
with bad designs, and lay snares, and
invent calumnies against their peaceful
dwellers, who, like Father Mateo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[838]</a></span>
sleep tranquilly in their cells; for our
holy patron watches over us.'</p>

<p>"'You can't doubt now,' said the
most timid of the three, 'that it was
the very St. Francis himself who went
with us to save that woman by a miracle.'</p>

<p>"'Father Mateo,' said the guardian
when they had gone, 'they are
terribly frightened, and have taken
you for St. Francis. It is better so;
for they are wicked men, and they
are furious.'</p>

<p>"'They honor me too much,' answered
the good man; 'but give me
leave, your fathership, to depart at
daybreak for a seaport, and from
thence to America, before they have
time to think better of it, and hang
upon me this miracle of St. Francis.'"</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE FIRST &OElig;CUMENICAL COUNCIL OF THE VATICAN.<br />

<small>NUMBER EIGHT.</small></h2>


<p>The proceedings of the Vatican
Council have reached a stage that
allows us to witness again its external
splendor and imposing presence.
Grand and most august as it certainly
is, still every thing that strikes the
eye fades away as one thinks of its
sublime office, of its important, unlimited
influence and effect. The nature
of the subject it has just treated
will necessarily make that influence
overshadow all ages to come, and
that effect cease to be felt only with
the last shock of a world passing
away.</p>

<p>The question that for more than a
year has agitated all circles of society,
that for the past three months has
been a subject of exciting debate
among the fathers of the council,
could not have been of greater weight.
It is one of those truths essential to
the existence of the church, and had
it not been practically acknowledged
among the faithful throughout the
world, Christianity, unless otherwise
sustained by its Author, would have
been an impossibility. The vital point
examined was the essence of the union
of the church, of the union of faith,
to determine dogmatically in what it
consists, who or what is the person or
body that can so hold and teach the
faith as to leave no doubt of any
kind whatsoever regarding its absolute
divine certainty.</p>

<p>Up to the present day the infallibility
of an &oelig;cumenical council, or of
the whole church dispersed throughout
the world, has been recognized as
the ultimate rule by all who lay claim
to orthodoxy; but with that council,
or with that church dispersed throughout
the world, as a requisite&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua
non</i>&mdash;was the communion and consent
of the sovereign pontiff. Where
he was with the bishops, there was
the faith; no matter how many bishops
might meet together and decree,
if Peter was not with them, there was
no certainty of belief, no infallible
guidance. Nay, their decrees were
received only in so far as approved
by him. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ubi Petrus, ibi ecclesia</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">[839]</a></span>
was the formula recognized by tradition.
In a word, where Peter was,
there was to be found infallible teaching;
where Peter was not, there neither
was the teaching infallible. None
in the church ever thought of gainsaying
this. But there came a time
when the element all agreed hitherto
to look on as essential began to be
a subject of doubt and of discussion.
Writers went so far as to say that the
pope could be judged by the other
body of teachers, the bishops; and this
followed naturally from a mistrust in
the unfailing orthodoxy of the sovereign
pontiff. The greater phases of
this movement are well known. The
Council of Constance had hardly closed
when the Council of Basle put in
practice the principles broached by its
predecessor, and deposed the reigning
head of the church, putting in his
stead Amadeus of Savoy with the
title of Felix V. In the midst of this
confusion, Eugenius IV. held the
Council of Florence, in which the remarkable
decree was published that
declared the pope the vicar of Christ,
the ruler of the flock, and the doctor
of the universal church. Those of
the French clergy who clung with
tenacity to the principles of Basle,
refused to receive this decree, under
pretence of the un&oelig;cumenical character
of the Council of Florence. The
Jansenists availed themselves of the
advantage this pretext gave them.
Although eighty-five French bishops
wrote in the year 1652 to Innocent
X., according, they say, to the custom
of the church, in order to obtain
the condemnation of these heretics,
the latter still held their ground,
and were able to accuse the French
assembly of 1682 of inconsistency, in
attempting to force on them a decision
of the pope, whom the assembly
itself declared fallible. The celebrated
Arnould taught that the refusal of
its approbation to a papal decision on
the part of one individual church was
enough to make the truth of such a
decision doubtful.</p>

<p>We shall try to give some idea of
the importance of the question of
papal infallibility by a parallel development
of two opposite teachings, in
a rapid sketch.</p>

<p>The cardinal principle of Gallicanism
is the denial of the inerrancy of
the sovereign pontiff in his solemn
ruling in matters of faith and morals
when teaching the whole church. Any
one who attentively looks at the question
must see the close connection of
the primacy with the claim to unerring
certainty in teaching. The domain
of the church is in faith, in
spirituals; temporals being secondary,
and the subject of legislation only in
so far as necessarily bound up with
the former. The only reason why a
teacher can lay claim to obedience is
because he teaches the truth, and this
is especially the case where faith and
conscience are concerned. If the
sovereign pontiff have not this faculty
of teaching the truth without danger
of error, then he cannot demand implicit
submission. The church dispersed
throughout the world, being
infallible, cannot be taught by one
who is capable of falling into error.
The ordinances therefore and decrees
of the pontiff, being intimately connected
with faith, and issued on account
of it, must follow the nature of
the submission to his teaching. But
as this latter, in the Gallican view, is
not obligatory unless recognized as
just by the whole church, so neither
are the ordinances and decrees to be
looked on as binding except under
a like reservation. It follows from
this, clearly and logically, that the supremacy
of the pope can be called
supreme only by an abuse of terms;
consequently, 1st, the texts of canon
law and of the fathers that teach a
perfect supremacy are erroneous or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[840]</a></span>
false, and have no foundation in tradition,
which is the truth always, everywhere,
and by every one held in the
same way; 2d, the texts of Scripture
that refer to Peter are to be restricted
to him personally, or, when
seeming to regard his successors, are
to be interpreted in a sense not favorable
to the idea of a perfect supremacy.
The pope thus becomes
amenable to the church; he is a divinely
constituted centre, nothing more;
the official representative of the bishops
of the whole church dispersed
throughout the world, which alone is
the ultimate criterion of truth. He can,
therefore, be judged by the bishops,
be corrected by them, deposed by
them, and his asserted right to reserve
powers to himself to the prejudice of
ordinaries, or to legislate for dioceses
other than his own, is to be set aside.
A species of radicalism is thus introduced
into the church. The bishops
themselves are not to be looked on
as infallible judges of the faith of their
flocks even, and the faithful themselves,
or the people, become the ultimate
judges of what is to be held as of
faith. Instead of being taught, they
teach; instead of being a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus theologicus</i>,
they become the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ecclesia
docens</i>; and the teachers and rulers
become the ruled and taught. As
the people themselves are liable to be
swayed by the influence and teaching
of artful men, we have in consequence
a weak and uncertain rule to go by;
weak, because of the moral impossibility
of knowing the sense of the
whole church, for even the members
of an &oelig;cumenical council might not
exactly represent the faith of their individual
churches; uncertain, because
of the facility with which in past
time the people of many individual
churches have been led astray.</p>

<p>As we write, it seems as if we heard
some indignant protest against what
we have just said. We reply that we
do not refer to individual opinions;
many Gallicans refused to go the
length of their principles; a sense of
danger alarmed their piety and put
them on their guard. For our part,
we treat of the principles themselves,
and deem perfectly consequent what
we have asserted. It would be an
easy matter to illustrate it with facts
of the present as of the past; but it
would be beyond our scope just now.
Any student of history will have no
difficulty in recalling the manner in
which defections from the church have
been brought about, and the errors of
those who once seemed columns of
the temple. The inadequacy of the
Gallican rule is still further shown by
its practical inconvenience. It is fortunate
that in the early church it had
no place whatsoever. Peter being
then recognized as the head and teacher
of the church, all controversies were
referred to him, and by him they were
settled. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Petrus per os Leonis, per os
Agathonis locutus est</i>; so spoke the fathers
of Chalcedon and of the Sixth
Council. Suppose for a moment it
had been otherwise; suppose, when
the Pelagian heresy arose, it had been
necessary to hear the voice of the
whole church scattered over the earth&mdash;this
being the rule&mdash;the whole
church, not any one part, was to give
the doctrine from which it was not
lawful to depart. Zosimus was but
one bishop; so, too, was Innocent
I.; Augustin was only one learned
man, and Prosper of Aquitaine, a
Christian poet and polished scholar,
but only one other father after all.
Those who wrote with them bore witness
each for his own particular church.
What had become of the churches of
Scythia, of Lybia, of Ethiopia, of
Arabia? Who had penetrated into
the Indies, or set sail for the islands
of the sea, or reached the far-off
coasts of the Sinenses? Who was to
explain with accuracy to those distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841">[841]</a></span>
Christians the cunning dealing
of Celestius and Pelagius, that had
deceived the vigilance of the eastern
fathers, and lay bare the hypocritical
professions that had misled even Zosimus?
Who was to bring back the
opinion or belief of these isolated
churches without danger of misunderstanding
or misinterpretation? Those
were not days when communication
was easy. Weeks and months amid all
kinds of dangers and uncertainty were
required to reach even those places
that lay near the shores of the Mediterranean.
It was physically impossible
to ascertain with unerring sureness
the belief or condemnation of
those far-off Christians; and as long
as their assent was not given there
was no adequate rule of faith. Consequently,
there was no prompt or
efficacious means of correcting error;
the means at hand were of probable
worth, therefore not sufficient to use
against heresy, that could always appeal
to the universal church dispersed
throughout the world, and when condemned
by those near, fly to the probable
protection of those at a distance,
without the least possibility of
ever knowing the belief of those to
whom they appealed. In the meanwhile,
heresy crept into the flock, established
itself there; for there was
none to cast it forth; and the fold became
tainted. Thus from age to age
Christianity would have been a mass
of error, the truth being obscured or
suffocated by the weight of falsity
from the want of a prompt practical
means by which heresy could be detected
and crushed at its birth. Happily
no such state of things existed;
the chair of Peter was the abode of
truth; it was set up against error, and
the quick ear and intuitive eye of
Christ's vicar heard and saw the evil,
and met it at the outset.</p>

<p>The doctrine which teaches the opposite
of what we have been describing,
and which is now of faith, clears
up all difficulties, and comes to us in
all the beauty and consistency that
adorns truth. Jesus Christ has made
Peter and his successors the foundation
of the church. He has given to
him, and to each of those who succeed
him, of his own firmness, and strengthened
his faith that it fail not, that he
may confirm his brethren. In this
office of confirming his brethren, Peter
holds the place of Christ, and acts
in his name. The gift he possesses,
however, is not one of inspiration; but
he is assisted and kept from erring in
his judgment of what is contained in
the revelation made by Christ to man.
To arrive at a knowledge of what
that revelation is, he seeks in his own
church, and, according to the need, in
the churches every where that he may
know their traditions. The judgment
he makes is infallible, and in promulgating
it he lays down the tenets of
faith for the whole church. Hence
he becomes the immovable rock
upon which the faithful are builded,
he is the centre around which they
revolve, the orb from which they receive
the light of faith. Hence he
has subject to him the minds of all,
and the character of his primacy becomes
more clear and fully evident.
It is no longer a mere point of visible
communion, but an active power
placed by God to rule, with unfailing
guidance in faith, and with a consequent
spiritual intuitiveness, that
makes him discern what is for the
good of the church at large throughout
the world. Hence all are bound
to obey him in what regards the faith
and teachings of Christ; who is with
him, is with Christ; whosoever is
against him, is against his Master.
Hence, too, by a direct consequence,
there can be no power set up against
his; all the bishops of the church depend
on him, receive their jurisdiction
from him, and can exercise it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[842]</a></span>
only at his word. What a sublime
picture of unity, of order, and of
strength! As an army in array the
church advances to do battle against
the foes of Christ, never more successful,
never more glorious, than when
her children, recognizing their dependence,
and harkening to her voice,
with one mind and with one heart
follow the leadership of Peter. No
wonder this spectacle struck the unbelieving
mind with astonishment, or
made the gifted writer of England
burst forth into the glowing description
so familiar to all!</p>

<p>The difference of opinion that existed
among the bishops on the subject
of the infallibility is known throughout
the four quarters of the globe.
What was the cause of it? If any
one imagines that all who joined in
opposing a definition from the outset
were actuated by the same motives,
he would certainly be wide of the
mark. While the main point of the
controversy was held by the <i>ultramontanes</i>
without exception, and there
was but the one question as to the
formula to be used, the opposition, as
they were generally called, taken all
together, had no fixed principle of accord,
save an agreement to disagree
with the defining the doctrine as of
faith. To analyze the constituent
parts of this body we shall class them
according to ideas.</p>

<p>First in conviction, in determination,
and in influence were the Gallicans,
properly so called, who held
and taught the very opposite of the
proposed dogma. They were mostly
men who had been bred in this teaching,
and who deeply reverenced the
memories of those who held and
taught it in past times. This class
was not very numerous, though it
grew larger in the course of the council
by the accession of those whose
examination of the question convinced
them of the claim of Gallicanism
to their adherence.</p>

<p>The second class comprised those
who, believing the doctrine themselves,
or at least, favoring it speculatively,
did not think it capable of definition,
not deeming the tradition of the church
clear enough on this point.</p>

<p>A third class, the most numerous,
regarded the definition as possible,
but practically fraught with peril to
the church, as impeding conversions,
as exasperating to governments. For
the sake of peace, and for the good
of souls, they would not see it proclaimed
as of faith.</p>

<p>All of these dissident prelates, we
are bound to say, acted with conscientious
conviction of the justice of
the cause they defended. They were
bound in conscience to declare their
opinions, and to make them prevail
by all lawful influence. If on one
side or the other of this most important
and vital question any went beyond
the limits of moderation, or
used means not dictated by prudence
or charity, it is nothing more than
might have been expected in so large
a number of persons, of such varied
character and education. Instead of
being shocked at the little occurrences
of this nature, we should rather be
struck with admiration at the self-restraint
and affability which were
shown, despite the intensity of feeling
and strength of conviction. In a
word, that the Council of the Vatican
did not break up months ago in disorder
and irreconcilable enmity, is because
it was God's work, and not
man's; it was because charity ruled in
it, in spite of defects, and not the passions
that govern the political debates
of men. The earnest desire all had
of a mutual good understanding was
evinced on occasion of the speech of
a well-known cardinal, which, though
not approved of by all, gave evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[843]</a></span>
of a sincere desire for conciliation and
agreement. The effect was remarkable;
a thrill of pleasure went through
the assembly, for the moment each
one seemed to breathe freely, and to
hail his words as harbingers of peace
in the midst of excitement and anxiety.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this incident
that the closure of the general discussion
on the four chapters of the present
constitution took place. The
regulations provide for this contingency,
making it lawful for ten prelates
to petition for the closing of a discussion,
the proposal being then put to
the vote of all the fathers, and the
majority deciding. In this case, a
desire not to interfere with remarks
which bishops, for conscientious reasons,
proposed to make, kept this regulation
in abeyance, and it was only
after fifty-five speeches had been listened
to, that one hundred and fifty
bishops sent in a petition for closing,
believing there would be ample time
and opportunity for every one to
speak and present amendments when
the <i>schema</i> would be examined in detail.
An overwhelming majority voted
the closure. It seems difficult to
understand how this could be found
fault with. Had there been no further
chance to speak, there would
have been reason undoubtedly to
claim hearing, or complain of not
being heard. But, as has been seen
since, there have been discussions on
each part of the <i>schema</i>; and on the
last chapter, regarding the doctrine of
infallibility, one hundred and nine
names were inscribed for speaking, of
which number sixty-five spoke, the
remainder by mutual consent abstaining
from speaking; thus of their own
accord putting a stop to a discussion
in which it was morally impossible to
say any thing new. It seems surely
to be a strange assertion to say there
has been any real infringement of the
liberty of speech in the council, when
there appears to have been so much
of it that the members themselves
grew weary of it.</p>

<p>While we are on this subject, we
wish to speak a little more fully, as
the freedom of the council has been
publicly impugned in two works, published
in Paris, against which the presidents
and the fathers have thought
proper formally to protest.</p>

<p>The grounds of the accusation are
chiefly three:</p>

<p>1st. The appointment of the congregation,
the members of which were
named by the sovereign pontiff, and
who received or rejected the postulata,
or propositions, to be presented to
the council for discussion.</p>

<p>2d. The dogmatic deputation having
been composed of those in favor
of the definition, and the members
having been put on it by management;
moreover, this deputation exercised
a controlling influence in the
council.</p>

<p>3d. The interruption of those who
were giving expression to their opinions,
in the exercise of their right to
speak.</p>

<p>We preface our brief reply to these
objections by two quotations. One
is from the letter of an apostate priest,
A. Pichler, at present director of the
imperial library at St. Petersburg,
which was written by him in Rome
last winter, and was published in the
<cite>Presse</cite> of Vienna. In it he says, "It
seems to us no council has ever been
freer or more independent." The second
quotation is from one of the
two works referred to above&mdash;<cite>Ce qui
se passe au Concile</cite>. At page 131 we
read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In truth, if the pope alone is infallible, it
is not only his right, but a duty, and a strict
duty, to guide the bishops, united in council,
or dispersed throughout the world, to encourage
them if they be in the right way, to
reprove them if they go out of it, to take an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[844]</a></span>
active part in the work of the assembly, to
inspire its deliberations, and dictate its decrees."</p></blockquote>

<p>Apart from the spirit that animates
the writer of the above, there is much
in what he says, and we take him at
his word. The &OElig;cumenical Council
of the Vatican has pronounced its irrevocable
and infallible decree, declaring
infallibility to be and to have been
a prerogative of the sovereign pontiff,
and that his decisions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedra</i>
are irreformable of themselves, and
not by virtue of the consent of the episcopacy.
We therefore draw our deduction,
and justify the sovereign pontiff,
by these very words, in nominating
the members of the congregation,
and in conferring on it the ample
powers it has. Secondly, we give
him the praise of moderation, because
he did not make a full use of the
rights accorded him by the author of
the citation we have given. Were
we to follow this writer, we should
have to accuse the pope of having in
part neglected a grave duty toward
the council, for he did not <i>dictate</i> its
decrees. In the very beginning, he
told the bishops he gave them the
<i>schemata</i>, unapproved by him, to be
studied, altered, or amended as they
saw fit; and, in fact, when the decrees
prepared previously by theologians
were proposed by the congregation,
they were recast and amended time
and again, and were finally decided
by a vote of the fathers, and approved
by the pontiff without alteration.
This is surely not dictation; dictation
does not admit of reply or refusal, it
takes away all liberty whatsoever.
The sovereign pontiff then did not
<i>dictate</i> the decrees.</p>

<p>Let us return to our triple objection.
First, with regard to the congregation.
In the early numbers of
<span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span> for the current
year, an account of the composition
of this body is given, as well as the
reasons for its appointment. We refer
our readers to the March number, in
which it may be seen that, although
possessed of sovereign powers over
the church, defined as belonging to
him, by the Council of Florence among
others, there was no disposition to
exercise coercion on the part of the
pope, who, in controlling the action
of the council in this way, was only
making use of a right the whole church
acknowledged. Moreover, the composition
of this body was itself a guarantee
of justice and zeal for the general
welfare. That there were not
named for it those who were known
to be hostile to what has just been
declared of faith, was nothing more
than natural. Moreover, when these
high ecclesiastics had admitted postulata,
their work was over; the propositions
passed into the control of the
fathers, and were decided by vote.</p>

<p>The answer to the second objection
is easier even. This deputation
was elected by the fathers themselves;
and as the large majority favored the
teachings of Rome, they elected none
who was opposed to them. As for
the accusation of management, we
must say that persons who understood
well the tendencies of the prominent
men of all parties, naturally, as happens
in all such large bodies, directed
the choice of candidates, and the
final vote of the fathers settled the
matter. It is hard to see how the
rights of any were violated. This
deputation, from the merit of those
that composed it, could not be without
great weight in the council; and
when we consider that it was the
choice of the large majority, and was
in harmony with the views of the
majority, it is not wonderful that it
controlled to a great extent the votes
of those composing the council.</p>

<p>The third objection is one that must
be treated with great delicacy, for two
reasons&mdash;because of the impossibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[845]</a></span>
of knowing all the circumstances, and
because those who are accused are
in a position that prevents them from
justifying themselves. The presidents
were named to act for the sovereign
pontiff, to preserve due order, to see
that the discussion was limited to the
matter in hand, and to prevent any
thing that might tend to disturb good
order, or diminish respect for the authority
and person of him they represented.
If, in the discharge of their
duty, they displeased those they addressed,
this was to have been expected;
if also they in any way did
not observe the due mean, so hard
to reach in every thing human, one
should excuse, if needful, the defect,
when especially the great merits, the
distinguished services, the known virtue,
and high position of these cardinals
are taken into consideration.</p>

<p>And while we are on this subject
of objections made against the council
we may notice two others that
especially regard the decree of the
infallibility; they are, 1st. This decision
destroys the constitution of the
church, doing away with the apostolic
college of bishops, and changing
the order established by Christ; 2d.
this decree is a theological conclusion;
but theological conclusions are
not of faith, and cannot be so declared.</p>

<p>These objections are formidable
only in appearance. No one contends
that each bishop when consecrated
succeeds to all the privileges
and powers of one of the apostles.
The bishops, then, not having them
in the beginning when consecrated
by the apostles, were distinct from
the apostles, the apostolic college
remaining. When one apostle died,
his death did not affect the powers
of the church, which remained the
same, the other apostles sufficing; so
when two, three, or more died, still
one remained. He had the same
full powers given to each, with subordination
to Peter as head of the
church. Thus with one apostle and
the episcopate the essence of ecclesiastical
rule is preserved. When St.
Peter died, he left a successor, being
the only one of the twelve who did;
for he was the only one who had a
see. His successor received all his
rights, the power of binding and loosing,
of teaching and legislating. He
was thus the one apostle living still
in the world, and each successive
pontiff has the same character&mdash;the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum</i> is his&mdash;as
it was Paul's, John's, and Peter's.
The essence of the hierarchy is in
this way preserved; the apostolic
and episcopal elements are there, and
the phraseology of Christianity keeps
ever before us this idea; for the see
of Peter is always known as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sedes Apostolica</i>. St. Peter Chrysologus
speaks of St. Peter living and
ruling in his successor&mdash;Beatus Petrus
qui in successore suo et vivet et
prÃ¦sidet et prÃ¦stat inquirentibus eam
fidem. So far, then, from this definition
destroying the character of the hierarchy,
it asserts and vindicates it by
declaring that the one apostle in the
church has never lost his apostolic
privilege of inerrancy, and that he is
truly possessed of the full powers
without diminution that belonged to
the prince of the apostles.</p>

<p>To the second objection, regarding
the nature of the definition, as being
a theological conclusion, we reply,
firstly, that what the Scripture, according
to the received and now authentic
interpretation of the church, taught,
and what the practical acknowledgment
of the faithful in all ages implied,
cannot be called a theological conclusion;
but must be regarded as being
what it is&mdash;a directly revealed
truth; secondly, a theological conclusion,
though not of faith in itself,
as being the deduction of reason, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[846]</a></span>
the <i>superadded authoritative decision
of the church</i> can become of faith, as
often as the denial of such conclusion
affects the truth of that dogma
from which it has been deduced.
Such questions are fairly within the
range of the church's arbitration; and
when there is a doubt concerning the
character of a conclusion, it is her province
to decide whether it be or be not
hurtful or beneficial to the truth of
which she alone is the divinely constituted
guardian. Examples in the
past history of the councils of the
church are not wanting; for our purpose,
take the Sixth Council. The
question of the two wills was a
theological conclusion; no one ever
spoke of the two wills before that
epoch; the phrase does not occur in
all previous theology or ecclesiastical
history. We first hear of it in the
east, where metaphysical studies flourished,
and where intellectual pride
had already brought about the Arian,
Nestorian, and Eutychian heresies.</p>

<p>We have mentioned the fact of the
closure of the discussion on the fourth
chapter, by mutual consent of those
whose names were inscribed to speak.
This was immediately followed by
voting. The first three chapters were
soon gotten over; the fourth is the one
that contains the doctrine on the infallibility,
and it met with more opposition.</p>

<p>On Saturday, July 11th, was held
the general congregation in which the
details of this portion of the <i>schema</i>
were up for approval or rejection.
On this occasion the voting was
by rising simply, and against the
definition there were forty-seven
votes.</p>

<p>On the 13th, another general congregation
was called to vote, according
to the regulations, on the
whole <i>schema</i>, by name, with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placet</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placet juxta modum</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non placet</i>.
The register, it appears, stands as follows:
451 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placets</i>, 62 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placets juxta
modum</i>, and 88 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non placets</i>.</p>

<p>Some of these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placets juxta modum</i>
recommended the insertion of words
that would make the decree clearer
and stronger. The <i>schema</i> was accordingly
altered, and the amendments
were retained in the general
congregation held Saturday, July
16th.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning was distributed
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">monitum</i>, by which the fathers
were notified that the fourth public
session would be held on Monday,
July 18th, at nine o'clock.</p>

<p>The 18th of July will henceforth
be a memorable day in the history
of the church. It did not dawn, however,
with the brilliancy usual at this
season, or almost habitual with the
grand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fÃªtes</i> of Pius IX. It rained
much during the preceding night,
and up to the time of the meeting of
the session wayfarers were liable any
time to be caught by fitful showers.
The thought that, although a great
and most beneficial act was to be
done, still there were not a few of the
fathers who thought otherwise than
the majority in a matter about to be
made binding on the conscience of
all, was not calculated to heighten
the external manifestation of cheerfulness,
whatever feelings of thankfulness
to Providence for the event was
in the heart. As the interest was
intense, there were not many, who
deemed they could come, who were
not present. At nine o'clock precisely,
his eminence Cardinal Barili began
a low mass, without chant. At the
end of it, the small throne for the
gospels was placed on the altar, and
upon it the copy of the sacred Scriptures.
In a few moments the sovereign
pontiff entered, preceded by the senate
and by the officers of his court,
and, after kneeling a few moments at
the prie-dieu, went to his throne in
the apsis of the aula. The customary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[847]</a></span>
prayers were recited by him; the
litany of the saints was chanted, and
the "Veni Creator Spiritus" intoned,
the people present taking part; after
which the Bishop of Fabriano ascended
the pulpit and read the <i>schema</i> to
be voted on, and finished with asking
the fathers whether it pleased them.
Monsignor Jacobini next, from the pulpit,
called the name of each prelate
assisting at the council. Five hundred
and thirty-four answered <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placet</i>,
two replied <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non placet</i>, and one hundred
and six were absent, some because
sick, the far greater number
not wishing to vote favorably. As
soon as the result was made known
officially to Pius IX., who awaited it in
silence, but with calmness, he arose
and in a clear, distinct, and firm voice
announced the fact of all, with the exception
of two, having given a favorable
vote, wherefore, he continued, by
virtue of our apostolic authority, with
the approval of the sacred council, we
define, confirm, and approve the decrees
and canons just read. Immediately
there arose murmurs of approbation
inside and outside the hall,
the doors of which were surrounded
by a large crowd, and, increasing
from the impossibility those present
experienced of repressing their feeling,
it swelled into a burst of congratulation,
and a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viva Pio Nono Papa infallibile</i>.
We shall not say any thing
regarding the propriety of such proceedings
in a church; but there are
times when feeling is so powerful as
to break through all ideas of conventionality.
As soon as all were quiet,
with unfaltering voice and excellent
intonation the pope began the Te
Deum. It was taken up alternately
by the Sistine choir and those present.
By an accident, at the Sanctus,
Sanctus, Sanctus, the people got out,
and took up the part of the Sistine
choir, and kept it to the end, alternately
with the bishops, and with a volume
of sound that completely drowned
the delicate notes of the papal
singers, and which, if not as musical as
their chant, was far more impressive.
The session ended with the apostolic
benediction from the holy father, accompanied
by an indulgence for all
assisting, in accordance with the custom
of the church. Thus passed one
of the most momentous and remarkable
occasions the world has ever witnessed,
a day henceforth memorable in
the annals of the church and of mankind,
the results of which the human
mind is scarce capable of grasping.</p>

The eternal Shepherd and Bishop
of our souls, in order to render perpetual
the saving work of his redemption,
resolved to build the holy church,
in which, as in the house of the living
God, all the faithful should be united
by the bond of the same faith and
charity. For which reason, before he
was glorified, he prayed the Father,
not for the apostles alone, but also
for those who, through their word,
would believe in him, that they all
might be one, as the Son himself and
the Father are one. (John xvii. 1-20.)
Wherefore, even as he sent the apostles,
whom he had chosen to himself
from the world as he had been sent by
the father, so he willed that there
should be pastors and teachers in his
church even to the consummation of
the world. Moreover, to the end that
the episcopal body itself might be
one and undivided, and that the entire
multitude of believers might be
preserved in oneness of faith and of
communion, through priests cleaving
mutually together, he placed the
blessed Peter before the other apostles
and established in him a perpetual
principle of this two-fold unity, and a
visible foundation on whose strength
"the eternal temple might be built,
and in whose firm faith the church
might rise upward until her summit
reach the heavens," (St. Leo the Great,
Sermon iv. (or iii.) chapter 2, on
Christmas.) Now, seeing that in
order to overthrow, if possible, the
church, the powers of hell on every
side, and with a hatred which increases
day by day, are assailing her foundation
which was placed by God, we
therefore, for the preservation, the
safety, and the increase of the Catholic
flock, and with the approbation
of the sacred council, have judged it
necessary to set forth the doctrine
which, according to the ancient and
constant faith of the universal church,
all the faithful must believe and hold,
touching the institution, the perpetuity,
and the nature of the sacred
apostolic primacy, in which stands the
power and strength of the entire
church; and to proscribe and condemn
the contrary errors so hurtful
to the flock of the Lord.

We teach, therefore, and declare
that, according to the testimonies of
the Gospel, the primacy of jurisdiction
over the whole church of God
was promised and given immediately
and directly to blessed Peter, the
apostle, by Christ our Lord. For it
was to Simon alone, to whom he had
already said, "Thou shalt be called
Cephas,"<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
that, after he had professed
his faith, "Thou art Christ, the
Son of the living God," our Lord
said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona;
because flesh and blood hath
not revealed it to thee, but my Father
who is in heaven; and I say to thee,
that thou art Peter, and upon this
rock I will build my church, and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against
it; and I will give to thee the keys
of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever
thou shalt bind upon earth, it
shall be bound also in heaven; and
whatsoever thou shalt loose upon
earth, it shall be loosed also in
heaven."<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
And it was to Simon Peter
alone that Jesus, after his resurrection,
gave the jurisdiction of supreme shepherd

fold, saying, "Feed my lambs;"
"Feed my sheep."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
To this doctrine
so clearly set forth in the sacred
Scriptures, as the Catholic Church
has always understood it, are plainly
opposed the perverse opinions of
those who, distorting the form of
government established in his church
by Christ our Lord, deny that Peter
alone above the other apostles, whether
taken separately one by one or
all together, was endowed by Christ
with a true and real primacy of jurisdiction;
or who assert that this primacy
was not given immediately and
directly to blessed Peter, but to the
church, and through her to him, as
to the agent of the church.

What the prince of pastors and the
great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord
Jesus Christ, established in the person
of the blessed apostle Peter for the
perpetual welfare and lasting good of
the church, the same through his power
must needs last for ever in that church,
which is founded upon the rock, and
will stand firm till the end of time.
And indeed it is well known, as it
has been in all ages, that the holy
and most blessed Peter, prince and
head of the apostles, pillar of the
faith and foundation of the Catholic
Church, who received from our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Saviour and Redeemer
of mankind, the keys of the kingdom
of heaven, to this present time
and at all times lives and presides
and pronounces judgment in the person
of his successors, the bishops of
the holy Roman see, which was founded
by him, and consecrated by his
blood.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
So that whoever succeeds
Peter in this chair, holds, according
to Christ's own institution, the primacy
of Peter over the whole church.
What, therefore, was once established
by him who is the truth, still remains,
and blessed Peter, retaining the
strength of the rock, which has been
given to him, has never left the helm
of the church originally intrusted to
him.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
<br /><br />
For this reason it was always necessary
for every other church, that
is, the faithful of all countries, to have
recourse to the Roman Church on
account of its superior headship, in
order that being joined, as members
to their head, with this see, from
which the rights of religious communion
flow unto all, they might be
knitted into the unity of one body.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>

had to his judgment, (Second Council
of Lyons;) but the decision of the
apostolic see, above which there is no
higher authority, cannot be reconsidered
by any one, nor is it lawful to any
one to sit in judgment on his judgment.
(Nicholas I. epist. ad Michaelem
Imperatorem.)<br />
<br />
Wherefore, they wander away from
the right path of truth who assert that
it is lawful to appeal from the judgments
of the Roman pontiffs to an
&oelig;cumenical council, as if to an authority
superior to the Roman pontiff.

This holy see has ever held&mdash;the
unbroken custom of the church doth
prove&mdash;and the &oelig;cumenical councils,
those especially in which the east
joined with the west, in union of faith
and of charity, have declared that in
this apostolic primacy, which the Roman
pontiff holds over the universal
church, as successor of Peter the
prince of the apostles, there is also
contained the supreme power of authoritative
teaching. Thus the fathers
of the fourth council of Constantinople,
following in the footsteps
of their predecessors, put forth this
solemn profession:<br />
<br />
"The first law of salvation is to
keep the rule of true faith. And
whereas the words of our Lord Jesus
Christ cannot be passed by, who said:
Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
will build my church, (Matt. xvi. 18,)
these words, which he spake, are
proved true by facts; for in the apostolic
see, the Catholic religion has
ever been preserved unspotted, and
the holy doctrine has been announced.
Therefore wishing never to be separated
from the faith and teaching of
this see, we hope to be worthy to
abide in that one communion which
the apostolic see preaches, in which
is the full and true firmness of the
Christian religion." [Formula of St.
Hormisdas Pope, as proposed by Hadrian
II. to the fathers of the eighth
general Council, (Constantinop. IV.,)
and subscribed by them.]<br />
<br />
So too, the Greeks, with the approval
of the second council of Lyons, professed,
that the holy Roman Church
holds over the universal Catholic
Church, a supreme and full primacy
and headship, which she truthfully
and humbly acknowledges that she
received, with fulness of power, from
the Lord himself in blessed Peter,
the prince or head of the apostles,
of whom the Roman pontiff is the
successor; and as she, beyond the
others, is bound to defend the truth
of the faith, so, if any questions
arise concerning faith, they should
be decided by her judgment. And
finally, the council of Florence defined
that the Roman pontiff is
true vicar of Christ, and the head of
the whole church, and the father and
teacher of all Christians, and that to
him, in the blessed Peter, was given by
our Lord Jesus Christ full power of
feeding and ruling and governing the
universal church. (John xxi. 15-17.)

In order to fulfil this pastoral
charge, our predecessors have ever labored
unweariedly to spread the saving
doctrine of Christ among all the nations
of the earth, and with equal care
have watched to preserve it pure and
unchanged where it had been received.
Wherefore the bishops of the whole
world, sometimes singly, sometimes assembled
in synods, following the long
established custom of the churches,
(S. Cyril, Alex. ad S. C&oelig;lest. Pap.,)
and the form of ancient rule, (St. Innocent
I. to councils of Carthage and
Milevi,) referred to this apostolic see
those dangers especially which arose
in matters of faith, in order that injuries
to faith might best be healed there
where the faith could never fail. (St.
Bernard ep. 190.) And the Roman pontiffs,
weighing the condition of times
and circumstances, sometimes calling
together general councils, or asking
the judgment of the church scattered
through the world, sometimes consulting
particular synods, sometimes using
such other aids as divine providence
supplied, defined that those doctrines
should be held, which, by the aid of
God, they knew to be conformable
to the holy Scriptures, and the apostolic
traditions. For the Holy Ghost
is not promised to the successors of
Peter, that they may make known a
new doctrine revealed by him, but
that, through his assistance, they may
sacredly guard, and faithfully set forth
the revelation delivered by the apostles,
that is, the deposit of faith. And
this their apostolic teaching, all the
venerable fathers have embraced, and
the holy orthodox doctors have revered
and followed, knowing most
certainly that this see of St. Peter
ever remains free from all error, according
to the divine promise of our
Lord and Saviour made to the prince
of the apostles: I have prayed for
thee, that thy faith fail not, and thou,
being once converted, confirm thy
brethren. (Conf. St. Agatho, Ep. ad
Imp. a Conc. &OElig;cum. VI. approbat.)

Martyr in Tonquin.</span> Translated
from the French by Lady Herbert.
London: Burns, Oates &amp; Co. 1870.
Pp. 215. For sale by the Catholic
Publication Society, 9 Warren Street,
New York.</p>

<p>China is the land of modern martyrdom.
She continues the work of Nero
and Diocletian. Within a few days the
newspapers have contained a brief account
of the latest massacre. These
persecutions have been constant since
her soil first drank the blood of a Catholic
missionary. Incited by their
pagan priests, secretly encouraged by
government officials, and sustained by
the approbation of the mandarins, the
ignorant and barbarous mobs of China
are only too ready for the murder of
those whom they term "Foreign Devils."
Throughout the world there
is at least partial toleration for the
teacher of the Christian religion; in
China there is only certain death. Father
VÃ©nard, then, went to China with
the hope and expectation of martyrdom.
This was tempered, indeed, by the
thought that he was unworthy of this
singular grace, but still it was the constant
thought of his life. In early childhood
it was his delight to read the
"Annals of the Propagation of the Faith"
with his dear sister MÃ©lanie; and once,
when he had scarcely reached his ninth
year, he was heard to exclaim, "And
I too will go to Tonquin; and I too will
be a martyr!" Those childish lips were
speaking a prophecy. Let twenty-two
years pass away, and the little French
lad will be found in a wooden cage, the
prisoner of barbarians, and awaiting
sentence of death. Sweet bird of paradise
that he was, it is not strange that
even a pagan mob should be touched
by his misfortunes. He hears the crowd
about his prison saying, "What a
pretty boy that European is!" "He is
gay and bright, as if he were going to a
feast!" "He is come to our country
to do us good." "Certainly he can't
have done any thing wrong." But in
China, as in more civilized nations,
popular sympathy has little influence
over the authorities who administer the
government. Doubtless there was some
law to be vindicated, and so, on February
3d, 1860, at the age of thirty-one,
Father VÃ©nard was beheaded. His
execution was not remarkable for any
great tortures, though it was cruel
enough. But this was due to an unskilful
headsman and a dull sword; and
as these accidents are frequent in the
execution of our criminals, it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_859" id="Page_859">[859]</a></span>
unjust to make it a reproach to those
who caused the death of the young
martyr. But his life does not require
the heroic endurance of tortures to make
it interesting. He wins our love simply
because he was so full of love himself.
He was a tender and affectionate
son, a warm and devoted brother, an
unfailing friend. Perhaps the greatest
of his sacrifices was made when he left
the sister to whom he was so warmly
attached that he might labor among the
heathen. It may have been a more
glorious triumph for the martyr to renounce
his idolized relatives than to
meet death bravely. We cannot, therefore,
see the appropriateness of Lady
Herbert's remark, that VÃ©nard "was no
ascetic saint, trembling at every manifestation
of human or natural feeling." If
he did not tremble at human affections,
at least he knew how to renounce them;
indeed, he saw that perfection could
only be gained by their renunciation.
But as Lady Herbert's sentence reads,
it conveys a reproach to the ascetics.
We might imagine that "an ascetic saint
trembling at every manifestation of human
or natural feeling" was something
greatly to be deplored. But when we
remember that St. Aloysius was so careful
in this matter that he would not raise
his eyes to look upon his own mother,
we may very fairly question the wisdom
of Lady Herbert's insinuation. She has
evidently used the word ascetic in a
Protestant sense; deriving it from the
word similar in sound, but totally different
in meaning&mdash;<i>acetic</i>. It would be
very difficult to assign exactly the part
which human affections play in Christian
perfection. Perhaps there is no
rule which will apply to all. The lives
of the saints show that they have looked
upon it in very different lights. Some
have completely broken all family ties;
others have cherished and sanctified the
love borne to their relations. It is only
fair, then, to conclude that God has directed
these souls in different ways. If F.
VÃ©nard yields up his life for Christ and
the Catholic faith, we will not quarrel
with him when he calls his sister "part
of his very life," or tells her that she is his
"second self." Yet such language could
not come from St. Aloysius, or St. Francis
Borgia, or St. Ignatius. Their piety
was cast in a more austere mould. But
coming from this dear martyr of Tonquin,
these words do not seem inappropriate.
No one would wish them
changed. They are the expression of
his innocent and childish disposition.
They prove our hero, though a priest
and a man of thirty, to be the worthy
companion of gentle St. Agnes. Of all
the martyrs none have resembled her
more closely than this heroic priest; all
that imagination has painted her will
be found in the reality of Father VÃ©nard's
life.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Notes on the Physiology and Pathology
of the Nervous System.</span>
With reference to Clinical Medicine.
By Meredith Clymer, M.D., University
Pennsylvania; Fellow of the
College of Physicians, Philadelphia.
D. Appleton &amp; Co. Pp. 53.</p>

<p>This brochure fulfils the promise of
its learned author in the introduction, in
which he "proposes to summarize the
recent investigations into the physiology
and pathology of the nervous system
which have a bearing on clinical
medicine."</p>

<p>The labor has been faithfully and
skilfully performed, and the history of
the scleroses of the brain and spinal
cord is carefully collected from the
English, German, and French&mdash;collated,
compared, and analyzed. The summary
is one of the utmost importance
to physicians, and is interesting to men
of general knowledge capable of appreciating
this class of subjects.</p>

<p>It is difficult to over-estimate the value
to science and society of the investigations
and studies into the physiology
and pathology of the nervous centres
which are being conducted all over
the world. Among the students of these
interesting subjects Dr. Clymer ranks
high as an observer, and chief in this
country as annalist and critic. He
holds a position in the world of medicine
analogous to that held by Brownson
in the domain of philosophy and
theology, and his services are of inestimable
value in correcting the hasty,
crude, and ill-advised speculations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_860" id="Page_860">[860]</a></span>
men who have neither acquired knowledge
nor powers of original observation
and reflection.</p>

<p>It is obviously out of place to pursue
the subject in its medical aspects in
this place, but we commend the pamphlet
to physicians, scientists, and jurists,
and also to theologians.</p>

<p>From this class of works they can
learn the basis on which medicine rests
as a science, and the essential immorality
of all forms of quackery.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Out of the Past.</span> (Critical and Literary
Papers.) By Parke Godwin.
New York: G. P. Putnam &amp; Sons.
1870.</p>

<p>This is a collection of nineteen articles
written for different magazines&mdash;principally
for the <cite>Democratic Review</cite>
and <cite>Putnam's Monthly</cite>&mdash;at various periods
from 1839 to 1856. The experiment
of publishing in book form an
author's fugitive essays is seldom successful.
True, it was so in the cases of
Carlyle and Macaulay. How far Mr.
Godwin may resemble them in this respect
remains to be seen. Should any
reviewer come to the treatment of this
book strong in the Vicar of Wakefield's
celebrated canon of criticism&mdash;that the
picture would have been better if the
painter had taken more pains&mdash;he will
find himself disarmed by Mr. Godwin's
prefatory apology, that these essays
"are more imperfect than they would
have been with a larger leisure at
my command." The subjects are
generally interesting, and their treatment
instructive. The style of these
essays is excellent, and their author's
opinions and criticisms on literature
and art generally of a healthy tone.
We cannot precisely agree with Mr.
Godwin when he credits a certain work
of Dutch art (p. 375) with the inspiration
of patriotism, but are glad to see
with his eyes that Thackeray</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Took no satyr's delight in offensive
scenes and graceless characters; that he
was even sadder than the reader could be
at the horrible prospect before him; that
his task was one conscientiously undertaken,
with some deep, great, generous
purpose; and that, beneath his seeming
scoff and mockeries, was to be discovered a
more searching wisdom and a sweeter, tenderer
pathos than we found in any other
living writer. We saw that he chastised in
no ill-natured or malicious vein, but in love;
that he cauterized only to cure; and that,
if he wandered through the dreary circles
of Inferno, it was because the spirit of Beatrice,
the spirit of immortal beauty, beckoned
him to the more glorious paradise."</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">A Compendium of the History of
the Catholic Church.</span> By Rev.
Theodore Noethen. Baltimore: John
Murphy &amp; Co. 1870. Pp. 587.</p>

<p>A hasty glance through the contents
of this work seems to justify these conclusions:
The chief merit of the book
is its numerous anecdotes. These illustrate
the particular customs and dangers
of Christians in different nations
and centuries. Compendiums usually
fatigue the mind with dates and uninteresting
details. Father Noethen has
carefully avoided this fault. He leads us
into the homes and by the hearth-side
of the Catholics of former times. Nothing
can be more useful than this. History
cannot be learned until we imagine
ourselves living at that very time
and taking our part in the scenes which
are described. So the words of a martyr,
or a sentence from a letter, or a
pious custom will often throw more
light upon history than whole pages of
detailed facts and speculations. In regard
to those more delicate questions
which every writer of a church history
must solve in some way, Father Noethen
appears to have acted with great
discretion. We were particularly pleased
with the remarks concerning Origen.
In this work that illustrious hero of the
early church is given the praise which
he has so long deserved, but which has
been so long denied him. By an oversight,
however, there is one unfortunate
sentence in this book. It speaks of
Constantine as "convening a general
council." Without doubt this expression
is incorrect; the Christian emperors
aided the meeting of &oelig;cumenical
councils; they never convened them.
That power was always reserved to the
sovereign pontiff alone. But apart from
this clerical error the book is very
praiseworthy, and will do good both to
Catholics and to Protestants.</p>

We desire to call attention to another point which
could not be discussed in the foregoing article, and to
which we can at present only allude in the briefest
manner. Large sums of money have been granted
by legislatures to universities and colleges which are
controlled by the clergy of different Protestant denominations,
in which they teach their religious opinions
without restraint, and which they make, as far as they
can, training-schools for their theological seminaries.
Now, if the outcry against any grant of public funds
to schools in which the Catholic religion is taught is
taken up and sustained by Protestants, it follows that
they must advocate the total secularization of all institutions,
without exception, which enjoy any state
subsidies, and, if they wish to keep control of religious
instruction in any of the above-mentioned colleges,
must refund to the state every thing which they
now possess by grant from the state, and give up all
claim to receive any further endowments. Catholics
would never disendow or despoil these Protestant
institutions, even if they had full power to do it; but
if the party of infidelity ever gains, by the help of
Protestants, full sway over our legislation, the latter
may prepare themselves for a wholesale spoliation.</p></div>

We have studiously avoided entering on the specific
subjects of the debate among the fathers. So far
as they have come to our knowledge, we are of course
not allowed to speak of them, at least at present.
But we trust we shall not be held as violating any
confidence when we repeat a statement made to us on
the best authority. Many of the fathers of the Vatican
Council seem well acquainted with our Second Plenary
Council of Baltimore. More than once it was referred
to with special commendation as having thoroughly
seized the character of this modern age in
which we live. And the desire was expressed that its
special regulations on one or two points for the church
in the United States could be made universal laws for
the whole church.</p></div>

When it shall have been established with the evidence
required by the Congregation of Rites that it
has pleased God to work two miracles, of the first
class, after the death of this venerable servant, through
his intercession, a decree may be issued stating that
fact, and allowing his beatification. When two other
miracles of the same class shall have been proved with
the same certainty to have occurred, after his beatification,
the blessed servant of God may be canonized
and enrolled among the saints of the church.</p></div>

"In the number of farms, from one to five acres,
the decrease has been 24,147; from five to fifteen
acres, 27,379; from fifteen to thirty acres, 4274; while
of farms above thirty acres, the increase has been
3670. Seventy thousand occupiers with their families,
numbering about three hundred thousand, were rooted
out of the land. In Leinster, the decrease in
the number of holdings not exceeding one acre, as
compared with the decrease of 1847, was 3749;
above one and not exceeding five, was 4026; of five
and not exceeding fifteen, was 2546; of fifteen to
thirty, 391; making a total of 10,617. In Munster,
the decrease in the holdings under thirty acres is stated
at 18,814; the increase over thirty acres, 1399. In
Ulster, the decrease was 1502; the increase, 1134.
In Connaught, where the labor of extermination was
least, the clearance has been most extensive. There
in particular the roots of holders of the soil were never
planted deep beneath the surface, and consequently
were exposed to every exterminator's hand. There
were in 1847, 35,634 holders of from one to five acres.
In the following year there were less by 9703; there
were 76,707 holders of from five to fifteen acres, less
in one year by 12,891; those of from fifteen to thirty
acres were reduced by 2121; a total depopulation of
26,499 holders of land, exclusive of their families,
was effected in Connaught in one year."&mdash;Captain

We could not say the human nature is divine, nor
could we say the human nature is God, or <i>vice versa</i>;
but we can only predicate the concrete terms of the
concrete. The metaphysical reason is, that the foundation
of this interchange of names and properties of
both natures lies in their being both concrete in the
subsistence of the Word. If we consider them abstractly,
they are separate, and consequently cannot
interchange attributes.</p></div>

Professor Jowett, <cite>Essays and Reviews</cite>, ninth ed.
p. 377. This essay contains several jokes, which to
us seem rather out of place. "Even the Greek Plato,"
says the professor, (p. 390,) "would have 'coldly
furnished forth' the words of 'eternal life.'" The
reader will remember the words of Shakespeare,

<p>
meaning (as is shown by the preceding words, <i>Thrift,
thrift, Horatio!</i>) that the marriage had followed
so close upon the funeral that the pasties which had
been hot at the one came up cold at the other.
The new turn given by Mr. Jowett to his original
has, we admit, a very humorous effect; but we cannot
help thinking that he has been unseasonably witty.</p></div>

He had previously denounced his sovereign from
the pulpit as an incorrigible idolatress and an enemy
whose death would be a public blessing. Randolph
writes to Cecil February, 1564, "They pray that God
will either turn her heart or send her a short life;"
adding, "of what charity or spirit this proceedeth, I
leave to be discussed by the great divines." And yet
we must not hastily condemn Knox, although a man
fifty-eight years of age, of indiscriminate sourness and
severity to all young women. He was at that very
time paying his addresses to a girl of sixteen.</p></div>

The swiftness of molecules and the vibratory motion
of ethereal atoms are astonishing, and surpass
all imagination. The former, measuring two thousand
metres, give eight millions of collisions in a second;
while the latter, within the same space, produce every
second several hundreds of millions more of undulations.</p></div>

According to the very curious experiments of M.
Hirn, the unity of heat or caloric in man, as well as
in inorganic matter, corresponds to four hundred and
twenty-five unities of mechanical labor&mdash;that is to say,
to four hundred and twenty-five kilogrammes raised
one metre high. Man gives in work twelve per cent
of the heat produced, which is almost equal to the
labor of our most perfect machines.</p></div>

This first expedition comprised five thousand
men; it was followed a year afterward, by a second
corps of three thousand, brought from the West-Indies,
but which remained only a short time in America.
They were commanded by MM. de Saint-Simon
and d'Autichamp.</p></div>

"We quartered with the Americans, but we asked
nothing from them but shelter. Each officer brought
with him his provisions and cooking utensils, his bed
and bedding, and we occasioned no expense whatever
to our hosts. I had for my use two wagons or covered

Does not this remark, written in the darkest period
of the Reign of Terror, and under danger of death, indicate
the most profound convictions? A very tragical
equality! and one that brought M. Blanchard and
the royal family together under circumstances deserving
of notice. On the 10th of August, when Louis
XVI. and his family sought refuge in the hall of the
Legislative Assembly, they were kept with their
suite for many hours in a small apartment, and when
the dauphin, who afterward perished in the Temple,
was in danger of being stifled with heat, he was let
down from the chamber into the hall, and received
upon the knees of Deputy Blanchard, who held him
there for a long time.</p></div>

The preliminaries of this peace, which recognized
the existence of a new nation, were signed the
10th of January, 1783. M. Blanchard received the
news the following March at Porto-Cabello, New
Spain, where the fleet which had brought our troops
with a view to an expedition against the English Antilles,
was lying at this moment. "The assurance of
this peace caused me great joy, both because I am a
citizen, and because I saw in it the termination of my
anxieties in regard to my family. The news was received
with enthusiastic joy by all, with the exception
of some few ambitious men who thought only of themselves
and their own fortunes."</p></div>

What has become of the journal of M. de Custine,
of which the manuscript of M. Blanchard makes
mention in the following passage? "To-day, M. de
Custine, who has just been travelling into the interior
of America, showed me his journal and the result of
his observations, which appear to me wise and liberal."
We have found no other trace of the Memoirs of
General de Custine on the campaign in America.</p></div>
